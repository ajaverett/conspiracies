1,"Dear Trump: the bill is now on your desk. Veto the shit out of it to protect the privacy of people YOU work for. Grow some balls and stand up to the swamp you supposedly were going to drain. If you don't, we WILL fight back",16894.0,6248nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6248nr/dear_trump_the_bill_is_now_on_your_desk_veto_the/,2420.0,1490757683.0,"This needs to be said.

Edit: to all those who think I am still a Trump supporter, just so you all know, I WAS a Trump supporter, but have become extremely disillusioned with him and his administration. I plead to other Trump supporters to open your eyes and mind about him, being a little more skeptical about who he is, and his actions. I have learned he is a CONMAN, and he is no different from previous presidents before him, including Obama, Bush, and Clinton, PROBABLY worse.


We must stand up to him. We must not blindly obey him just because he said he was going to drain the swamp and you think he's playing 420D backgammon Chinese checkers. It's all bullshit, he's full of bullshit, and you all need to OPEN your eyes.

This is r/conspiracy for fuck's sake, NOT r/the_scumbag, or any other biased subreddit.

Be skeptical of ALL authority.


Edit2: I never voted for Trump. I stopped supporting him before election day. I bought into his bullshit during the beginning of his campaign when he was promising to drain the swamp, but I eventually realized how much we've been played and DUPED by this fuckwad.

2,I am combing through all the Epstein files. You asked for it. Here it is. PART 2 - The next 300+ page breakdown.,15930.0,cr4tvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cr4tvy/i_am_combing_through_all_the_epstein_files_you/,815.0,1565953465.0,"Well, I didn’t get much sleep and [posting this goes against the recommendation of my doctor](https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/jeffrey-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-spotted-at-in-n-out-burger-in-first-photos-since-his-death/ “Epstein Gal pal found at IN-N-OUT reading book on Deaths of CIA Operatives”), but I finished it and just in time for Friday morning.

First, I would just like to say thank you to everyone who upvoted, shared this and gave me an award. You guys really motivated me to keep reading this stuff and broke my reddit with all the messages. Last night we reached 17th on the front page. I almost died when I saw that (not by two shots to the back of the head either just shock). So many people must have seen it and that is my biggest hope for this work. The more eyes the better. 

Second, for all of you asking, no I do not intend to kill myself by shooting myself in the back of the head twice, [strangling myself in a way more common with murder then suicide](https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php?utm_campaign=CMS%20Sharing%20Tools%20(Desktop)&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral “Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said”) , or any other way to be clear? I am a little exhausted, grossed out, stopped following a few people, broke my reddit, but not my neck thankfully in a mysterious fall, but other then that I am great.

Third, there is one section of pages, 34-90, exhibit E through K, that you might want to skip over, if you are trying to save time. I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents. Lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly, otherwise you can skip that content if you want. Personally, I would still read it. There are some names you might want.

Since many of you also keep asking, yes you can share this content. Do what ever you want with it. Copy and paste, save it, put it on your own blogs, use it for your own research, make a video out of it, make fun of it. Anything is approved. [Censorship is a issue we all have to help to overcome](https://youtu.be/wSTHgoaVtSw). The only thing I ask is if you share it please try to link back the original reddit page so people can upvote it. I don’t mind if you are looking for karma or views but the more upvotes on a single post the more we get boosted to the front page and the more eyes that will see it. If you do not want to lose it, you can bookmark it by clicking the little flag on the top right.

Finally, here are a few things to look out for:

-	Names of lawyers, associates to Epstein. 
-	Claims about Prince Andrews shady deals and friends. 
-	What the newspapers wrote at the time.
-	How Giuffre got the job at Mar-a-Lago.
-	Testimony from Fiancé at time, father and others 
Overall this dump is less salacious then the first, but I feel just as important, especially for trying to answer certain questions you guys were asking in the first post.

-	Failed to join under rule 15 because undue delay joining, undue prejudice that amendment will cause. 

Page 35-36

Page 38

allegations made against him and requesting a show cause order to the attorney that have made them”. Court

intervention.

P., which provides “a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all discrete subparts” – in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories in this case, including subparts, in violation of Rule 33

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege

(Missing pages)

Page 72

-	A request that each of these attorneys list all communications with the media is facially overbroad

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to this Interrogatory because a response would cause Ms. Giuffre the incredible and undue burden of having to catalogue literally hundreds of communications that she has already produced in this case.

-	Giuffre objects because this interrogatory calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence

-	Giuffre objects to the extent that this interrogatory seeks the communications of her attorneys, any author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer, commentator, investigative journalist, photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter, stringer, or any other employee of any media organization or independent consultant

-	Ms. Giuffre is not obligated to produce anything currently in the possession of Defendant Maxwell or her attorneys.

Page 87

-	Needed to do was issue an immediate denial and that necessarily had to be short and to the point 

-	Claimed they were “obvious lies”

-	Barden goes after Giuffre credibility for not stating certain claims sooner or claiming that they have changed 

-	For example – “Yet in her joinder motion she claimed she did have sex with Prince Andrew and that the sex 
occurred in what can only be described as a very small bathtub, too small for a man of Prince Andrew’s size to 
enjoy a bath in let alone sex”

Page 88

-	Barden did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely to disseminate 
information to the media

-	purpose in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated to those media representatives was twofold. 

-	First, wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation

-	Second, intended statement to be “a shot across the bow” of the media, which I believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff’s allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own

-	intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients
Page 90

-	Continues to try to attack Giuffre’s credibility

-	Brings up Alan Dershowitz

-	Barden claims it was his opinion Giuffre was lying

-	Q) Do you remember there being a job posting that you felt like was appropriate for Virginia or did you just go out and talk to the woman who ran the spa area on your own? 

-	A) I just talked to Angela. 

-	Q) Okay. Do you recall whether this was intended to be a full-time job? 

-	A) I don't remember if it was full time or just summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. 

-	Q) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? 

-	A) Probably from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess.

-	A) Times of the year, yes. 

-	Q) And it's more guests that come during that period of time?

-	A) Every year. 

-	Q) And in the summer, it's relatively dead because it's so hot? 

-	A) Basically, it closed during the summer. That's when we would kind of work on everything and then make sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you know. 

-	Q) Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired to work in, what her job title was, for example? 

-	A) I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia. That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was busy all the time. 

-	Q) I understand. 

-	A) I didn't have time to go see what she was doing. I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out.

-	A Where did I learn that? 

-	Q) Uh-huh. 

-	A) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. 

-	Q) When did Virginia tell you this? 

-	A) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.

-	Q I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? 

-	A) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other job

Page 226

-	Q) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein? 

-	A) Once. 

-	Q) When was that? 

-	A) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.

-	Q) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him? 

-	A) Yeah. 

-	Q) Was it later? 

-	A) I think it was about the time she started. Because I wanted to see where she was at, you know. And it was just a mansion down the street from, you know, Mar-a-Lago. So I didn't think twice about it. I didn't think nothing of it. He came out. He was very cordial, very nice.

-	Q) Okay. Have you ever met Ms. Maxwell? 

-	A) Not that I remember ever meeting her.

Initially, I found it to be a community of rational individuals who wanted to question the status quo. During the height of the Epstein case last year it was pleasing to see users accept that NONE of our politicians are innocent and essentially on the same team. 

However, I've noticed over the summer that posts on r/conspiracy have become overwhelmingly right leaning. Half the time there's no real conspiracy being discussed! As I'm typing this, this sub has become nothing more than a right wing political page.  

What;s even worse is that I've noticed a flood of pro QAnon posts. For years Qanon has been ridiculed by serious conspiracy theorists based on how wrong it has been about virtually every event. The fact that anyone would believe that Trump, a man who's been a billionaire since his birth, is somehow attempting to expose the corruption of the elite is mind boggling to me.

Most posts are submits very similar to Maxwell.  Might be a sockpuppet.  Might be an acquaintance or employee.

Focused on subreddits Health, Democrats and more (moderator in a bunch of groups including these).  Focused topics: A bunch of corona articles targeted to bash Trump.

My opinion: This is an sockpuppet account by Maxwell to flood her ideology into more subreddits and have more power when her moderator role is questioned.  We should extend our investigations towards that account as well.

We were shooting some of this at the time of Harvey Weinstein. We wanted to investigate how does someone like Harvey Weinstein gets away with doing what…get away with criminality, essentially. And the network that surrounds him. We decided that Gio would interview a concierge in Las Vegas. During the interview, I revealed that basically Gio has molested an eight-year-old boy. Now, mind you, this is extreme comedy and we thought that the guy would leave the room. Instead, this concierge stays in the room and I go, listen, you’ve got to help me get rid of the problem. And this guy starts advising Gio how to get rid of this issue. We even at one point talk about murdering the boy, and the concierge is just saying, ‘well, listen, I’m really sorry. In this country, we can’t just drown the boy. This is America we don’t do that.’ And then, in the end, he puts me in touch with a lawyer who can silence the boy. I became really dark stuff. And then at the end of the interview I say, listen, I want to go out and celebrate now. Can you get me a date for tonight? He says, ‘what do you mean, a date?’

I go, you know, like a young man. He says, ‘well, what kind of age?’ I say, lower than Bar Mitzvah but older than eight. And he says, ‘yeah, I can put you in touch with somebody who can get you some boys like that.’

DEADLINE: None of this remotely qualifies as comedy. What did you do?

BARON COHEN: We immediately turned over the footage to the FBI because we thought, perhaps there’s a pedophile ring in Las Vegas that’s operating for these very wealthy men.

\- DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 11. One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre “named” repeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms. Maxwell. According to the “lurid details” of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a “sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme” created by Epstein: § Ms. Maxwell “approached” Ms. Giuffre in 1999 when Ms. Giuffre was “fifteen years old” to recruit her into the scheme. § Ms. Maxwell was “one of the main women” Epstein used to “procure under-aged girls for sexual activities.” § Ms. Maxwell was a “primary co-conspirator” with Epstein in his scheme. Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page6 of 66 7 § She “persuaded” Ms. Giuffre to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other children.” § At the mansion, when Ms. Giuffre began giving Epstein a massage, he and Ms. Maxwell “turned it into a sexual encounter.” § Epstein “with the assistance of” Ms. Maxwell “converted \[Ms. Giuffre\] into . . . a ‘sex slave.’” Id. Ms. Giuffre was a “sex slave” from “about 1999 through 2002.” § Ms. Maxwell also was a “co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse.” § Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes she committed in Florida.” § Ms. Maxwell “participat\[ed\] in the sexual abuse of \[Ms. Giuffre\] and others.” § Ms. Maxwell “took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including \[Ms. Giuffre\].” Id. She shared the photos with Epstein. § As part of her “role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring,” Ms. Maxwell “connect\[ed\]” Epstein with “powerful individuals” so that Epstein could traffic Ms. Giuffre to these persons. § Ms. Giuffre was “forced to have sexual relations” with Prince Andrew in § “\[Ms. Maxwell’s\] apartment” in London. Ms. Maxwell “facilitated” Ms. Giuffre’s § sex with Prince Andrew “by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein.” § Ms. Maxwell “assist\[ed\] in internationally trafficking” Ms. Giuffre and “numerous other young girls for sexual purposes.” § Ms. Giuffre was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.”

\- Picture of Maxwell, prince Andrew drew and Giuffre.

\- Ms Giuffre travel records are incomplete, many examples. She was being flown by them without keeping records some of the time

Page 243

\- Detective Recarey knew that Maxwell was involved in the illegal sexual activities at Epstein's house. He wanted to speak to her, but Maxwell did not return his calls. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 28:23-29:10.

\- A walk through video taken during the execution of the search warrant revealed photos of topless females at the home, and there was even a photograph of Maxwell naked hanging in the home. The house staff who were deposed in the civil cases each testified to Maxwell being the boss in charge of everyone in the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 1, Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page55 of 66 56 19, 21, Banasiak Dep. Tr. at 8:21-9:16; 14:20-15:6; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 23:11-23:20; Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 169:1-169:4.

Page 244

\- Rodriguez, the house butler from 2004 through 2005, a time period that revealed daily sexual abuse of underage females, testified that Maxwell kept a list of the local girls who were giving massages at her desk, and that Maxwell kept nude photos of girls on her computer. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 238:4-238:22; 302:19-303:10; 306:1- 306:24.

\- Recarey testified that when the search warrant was executed, the house had been sanitized and the computers removed from the home. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 72:25-73:15.

\- Banaziak testified that the computers were removed by Adriana Ross, another employee who answered to Maxwell. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 19, Banaziak Dep. Tr. at 54:7-22.

Page 245

\- Tony Figueroa, Ms. Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, did testify that Maxwell personally requested that he find and bring girls to Epstein for sex once Ms. Giuffre had escaped, and that when he brought the girls Maxwell interacted with them. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 200:6-18; 228:23-229:21.

\- Rodriguez testified unequivocally that Maxwell was ""the boss"" and that she knew everything that was going on. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 169:1-169:4.

\- Nude photographs were displayed throughout Epstein’s home. Furthermore, Alfredo Rodriguez testified to Maxwell having pornography on her computer. Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24.

\- He also testified to there being a collage of nude photos in Epstein's closet. Id. 253:14-254:18. That collage was eventually taken into evidence by Detective Recarey, who testified to that fact in his deposition. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24.

\- **And those photos are still in the possession of the FBI or US Attorney's Office. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 74:2-74:7.**

\- Ronaldo Rizzo, who visited the home on numerous occasions and who was reprimanded by Maxwell herself for looking at the nude photos. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 14, Rizzo Dep. Tr. at 25:19-26:20.

Page 246

\- Johanna Sjorberg testified that the Defendant bought her a camera for the specific purpose of her taking nude photos of herself. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16 Sjoberg Tr. at 150.

\- Virginia Giuffre testified that there was a nude photograph of her at the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5 Virginia Giuffre Tr. at 232 and 333.

Page 264

\- Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for Epstein, and punished her when she didn’t cause Epstein to orgasm.

\- Tony Figueroa testified that Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for Epstein, and also testified that Maxwell and Epstein participated in multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre.

\- the butler for Defendant’s close friend witnessed, first-hand, a fifteen-year-old Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with Epstein and she refused.

\- Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sextrafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls” defense.

Page 265

\- Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that Defendant shared with Ms. Giuffre – although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even a single one of those flights.

\- Defendant’s heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring and in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms. Giuffre was a minor, and traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein – including 23 documented flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre were regularly together.

Page 266

\- The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a household with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While there, she actively took part in recruiting underage girls and young women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers.

\- Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a minor when Defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Thereafter, Ms. Giuffre flew on Epstein’s private jets – the – Lolita Express” – with Defendant at least 23 times.

\- Ms. Sjoberg’s account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly similar. As with Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg’s school grounds. She lured Ms. Sjoberg into her and Epstein’s home under the guise of a legitimate job of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college student, Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page12 of 74 5 nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to massage Epstein, and made it clear that Sjoberg’s purpose was to bring Epstein to orgasm during these massages so that Defendant did not have to do it.

Page 268

\- Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion.

\- **Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre’s breast while using a hand to touch Ms. Sjoberg’s breast.**

\- Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms. Giuffre had with Defendant and Epstein which included the use of strap-ons.

Page 269

\- Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had found any other girls for Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls for Epstein:

Page 270

\- Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears – how, while working at Dubin’s house, he observed Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin’s house. In distress, the 15 year old girl tearfully explained to him that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through threats and stealing her passport.

Page 271

\- Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre’s mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre started living with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre’s “new momma.” 10 Incredulously, Defendant testified that she barely remembered Ms. Giuffre.

\- Detective Recarey led the Palm Beach Police’s investigation of Epstein. He testified that Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her in relation to his investigation, but could not contact her due to the interference of Epstein’s lawyer.

Page 272

\- Notably, at Defendant’s deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms. Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein’s pilot’s flight logs.13

\- However, David Rodgers, Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials – GM – was, in fact, Ghislaine Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which Defendant flew with Plaintiff. 14 The dates of those flights show that Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on many of them when she flew with Defendant.

\- Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years. They both invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s participation in recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein.

Page 273

\- Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him.

Page 274

\- Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one – to testify that Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or participate in the sex.

\- Even one of her own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex.

\- Another one of Defendant’s witnesses, Ms. Giuffre’s mother, named Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s “new mamma.” Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time with her in Epstein’s shared household, like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have testified that she was Epstein’s procuress.

\- Others who lived with her – Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia Marcinkova, and Sarah Kellen – invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions on the same. No one has testified to the contrary.

\- **Defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and why she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a child, including 6 international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile’s private jet all over the world.**

Page 275

\- Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre’s photographs of her, Defendant, and Epstein.

\- She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was photographed with his hand around Ms. Giuffre’s bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with Defendant, inside Defendant’s house in London.

\- This photograph corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted sex offender.

\- Ms. Giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and Epstein.

Page 276

\- Ms. Giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the Zorro Ranch, Epstein’s New Mexico Ranch.

\- Among other nude photos, which included full nudes of Defendant, Ms. Giuffre produced images of females that the Palm Beach Police confiscated during the execution of the 22 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 42, GIUFFRE007175; 007173. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page22 of 74 15 warrant, including one photograph revealing the bare bottom of a girl who appears to be prepubescent.

Page 277

\- In 2008, the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida identified Ms. Giuffre as a protected “victim” of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex abuse. The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms. Giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.

\- Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case, including medical records from the time when Defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both 23 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 44, GIUFFRE007584. 24 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 30, GIUFFRE 002216-002218, Victim Notification Letter. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page23 of 74 16 Defendant and Epstein taking Plaintiff to New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York while she was a minor. The dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old.

Page 278

\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice

\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice.

\- Ms. Giuffre sought counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by Defendant and Epstein. A 2011 psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist, unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s abuser.

Page 279

\- Years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her treating psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein.

\- Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into Epstein and his associates’ sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of hand-written messages taken by various staff, including Defendant, at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence.

\- The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell’s involvement in the sexual abuse of minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell’s denial of any involvement with Epstein during relevant time periods, and, accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events.

Page 280

\- Messages reveals that Maxwell, “GM,” took messages at the residence, including from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein.

Page 282

\- One message pad reflects , who is identified in the Palm Beach Police Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for “work” explaining that she does not have any money. The term “work” was often used by members of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages.

\- Giuffre 001462: July 5th no year to JE from ”I need work. I mean I don’t have money. Do you have some work for me?”

\- Other message pads reflect who was a minor, calling and leaving a message at the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for Jeffrey Epstein. The second message demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein required different girls to be scheduled every day of the week. The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the home at the same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate the lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at least raises a question of fact whether Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as Giuffre has said, or whether Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or aware of this activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe

\- Giuffre 001428 – undated Jeffrey From – “Has girl for tonight” ;Giuffre 001432 (pictured above)– 7/9/04 – Mr. Epstein From – “ is available on Tuesday no one for tomorrow”; GIUFFRE 001433 /1/17/04 – Mr. Epstein from – “Me and \_\_\_\_\_ can come tomorrow any time or alone” ; Giuffre – 001452 – undated Jeffrey from “Has girl for tonight.”

\- Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis.

\- Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)– JE from “N” – “ hasn’t confirmed for 11:00 yet, so she is keeping on hold in case doesn’t call back; Giuffre 001448 -8/20/05 JE from - confirmed \_\_\_ at 4 pm. Who is scheduled for morning? I believe wants to work.”

\- This message pad reflects that a friend of Jeffrey Epstein is sending him a sixteen year old Russian girl for purposes of sex.

\- Giuffre 001563 (pictured above)- 6/1/05 For Jeffrey From Jean Luc “He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 1st today if you call.”

Page 283

\- This message pad directly refutes Maxwell’s sworn testimony that she was not present during the year 2005 at Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion because this shows leaving a message for Jeffrey at the Palm Beach home that she was going to work out 30 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 28. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page28 of 74 21 with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only able to retrieve a fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered, it shows Maxwell was regularly at the Palm Beach home during the time period she claimed she was not. To the contrary, she was both sending and receiving messages and messages, like this one, reflect her presence at the mansion.

\- Giuffre 001412 – 9/10/05 (during the year Maxwell says she was never around) JE from – “I went to Sarah and made her water bottle and I went to work out with GM.”

\- These message pads further corroborate that Defendant lied in her testimony and she was in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the years 2004 and 2005. For example, the message from “Larry” demonstrates that Defendant is at the Palm Beach mansion so frequently that people, including Epstein’s main pilot Larry Visoski, are leaving messages for Maxwell at the Palm Beach house.

\- Giuffre 001435 7/25/04 – Mr. Epstein from Ms. Maxwell – “tell him to call me”; Giuffre – 001449 – 8/22/05 – JE from GM; Giuffre – 001453 – 4/25/04 for Ms. Maxwell From Larry “returning your call”;

\- This message pad shows that Defendant was clearly actively involved in Jeffrey Epstein’s life and the activities at his Palm Beach mansion.

\- Giuffre – 001454 – undated Jeffrey From Ghislaine – “Would be helpful to have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ come to Palm Beach today to stay here and help train new staff with Ghislaine.”

\- This message pad clearly reflects an underage female (noted by the police redaction of the name) leaving a message asking if she can come to the house at a later time because she needs to “stay in school.”

\- ” Giuffre 001417 (pictured above)– Jeffrey 2/28/05 Redacted name “She is wondering if 2:30 is o.k. She needs to stay in school.”

\- This message pad reflects a message from who was under the age of eighteen at the time she was going over to Jeffrey Epstein’s home to provide sexual massages according to the Palm Beach Investigative Report.

\- Giuffre 001421 3/4/05 to Jeffrey from “It is o.k. for to stop by and drop something?”

\- These message pads reflect the pattern of underage girls (noted by the police redaction of the name on the message pad) calling the Palm Beach mansion to leave a message about sending a “female” over to provide a sexual massage.

\- Giuffre 001423 11/08/04 To Mr. JE – redacted from – “I have a female for him”Giuffre 001426 (pictured above) – 1/09/05 JE To JE from Redacted – “I have a female for him.”

Page 284

\- This message pad reflects the pattern and practice of having young girls bring other young girls to the house to perform sexual massages. Indeed the “ ” reflected in this message pad corresponds in name to the ” that Tony Figueroa testified he initially brought to Jeffrey Epstein during the time period that the Defendant was requesting that Tony find some young females to bring to Jeffrey Epstein’s home. See Figueroa at 184- 185. The Palm Beach Police Report reflects that “ ” and “ ” also brought seventeen year old to the home to perform sexual massages. See GIUFFRE 05641. thereafter recruited a number of other young girls to perform sexual Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page29 of 74 22 massages as reflected in the Palm Beach Police Report.

\- Giuffre 001427 (pictured above) – 1/2/03 – JE from “Wants to know if she should bring her friend with tonight.”

\- This message pad reflects multiple sexual massages being scheduled for the same day which corroborates Virginia GIUFFRE, and Johanna Sjorberg’s testimony that Jeffrey Epstein required that he have multiple orgasms in a day which occurred during these sexual massages.

\- Giuffre 001449 (pictured above) – 9/03/05 JE from – “I left message for to confirm for 11:00 a.m. and for 4:30 p.m.”

\- This message pad shows a friend of Jeffrey Epstein’s discussing with him how he had sex with an 18 year old who had also been with Jeffrey Epstein.

\- Giuffre – 001456 (pictured above)– undated JE from Jean Luc – “He just did a good one – 18 years – she spoke to me and said “I love Jeffrey.”

\- Law enforcement was able to confirm identities of underage victims through the use of the names and telephone numbers in these message pads

Page 285

**The Black Book**

\- Palm Beach Police confiscated an extensive lists of contacts with their phone numbers form Defendant and Epstein’s residence.32 Ghislaine Maxwell maintained a contact list in an 31 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 42:14-43:17; 78:25:-79:15. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page30 of 74 23 approximately 100-page-long hard copy, which was openly available to other house employees.

\- It consisted primarily of telephone numbers, addresses, or email addresses for various personal friends, associates, employees, or personal or business connections of Epstein or Defendant. Prior to being terminated by Defendant, the Palm Beach house butler Alfredo Rodriguez printed a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the FBI.

\- This document reflects the numerous phone numbers of Defendant, Epstein as well as staff phone numbers.

\- Additionally, and importantly, there are several sections entitled “Massage” alongside a geographical designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers. These numbers included those of underage females (with no training in massage therapy ) – including – identified during the criminal investigation of Epstein. This document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with Epstein, Defendant, and the management of their properties, and the knowledge each had of the contents of the document.

**Sex Slave Amazon.com Book Receipt**

\- Detective Recarey authenticated an Amazon.com receipt that the Palm Beach Police collected from Jeffrey Epstein’s trash.

\- The books he ordered are titled:

(1) SM 101: A Realistic Introduction, Wiseman, Jay;

(2) SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude – Principles, Skills and Tools by Guy Baldwin; and (3) Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners, by Christina Abernathy, as shown below: 32 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 45, Phone List, Public Records Request No.: 16-268 at 2282 – 2288. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page31 of 74 24

\- This disturbing 2005 purchase corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s account of being sexually exploited by Defendant and Epstein – not to mention the dozens of underage girls in the Palm Beach Police Report. Additionally, Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and 2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however, record evidence contradicts that testimony.

Page 287

**Thailand Folder with Defendant’s Phone Number**

\- Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to Thailand. While Epstein had paid for a massage therapy session in Thailand, there was a catch.

\- Defendant told Virginia she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and Defendant.

\- On the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant wrote on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet, and she was also instructed to check in frequently with Defendant as it was further signified by the words “Call Ms. Maxwell (917) !” on Virginia’s travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the hard copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein.

\- The FBI report and the Churcher emails reference Ms. Giuffre’s accounts of sexual activity with Prince Andrew that she made in 2011, contrary to Defendant’s argument that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until 2014.",conspiracy,Trump

None of that matters! IT DOESN’T fucking matter ok? We are all being still being dicked by the same people and same fucking organizations, and the same slave system. People seem to forget how many other players are involved in this game or theatre if you like, you still got China, Russia, U.N., Vatican, Intelligence agencies, media, banking cartel, Hollywood, Council of Foreign Relations, Rockefeller’s, Rothschilds, Israel Mossad...

So don’t take this republican / democrat / conservatives stuff too seriously. These are all labels, they are constructs made by man, all they do is separate and divide us. They are all tools of the elite to control and manipulate you and play with your emotions.

Even if Trump is re-elected, you can bet on your life that the game plan would still continue. Because there’s Too many players that want it too continue, they have invested a lot of time and money and aren’t ready to lose it that easily.

Pravda was a Russian broadsheet that used to be the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The word is Russian for ""Truth"" 

(James O'keefe also published a book called American Pravda this year, but idk if Musk is a Project Veritas fan or it's just a coincidence

Leading to [this article on negative coverage of Tesla in the news](https://electrek.co/2018/05/23/tesla-tsla-rally-media-negativity-increasingly-immaterial-baird/), quoting a Baird auto analyst who says

>Negative headlines have increased substantially in the past month and, in our opinion, increasingly immaterial reports have dominated news cycles. We think we have hit a peak in negative coverage/sentiment, and believe shares could appreciate significantly with execution, which should coincide with an improvement in sentiment.

A Verge reporter replies ""Musk continues his slow transformation into a media-baiting Trump figure screaming irrationally about fake news. Hope it works out for you dude!""

Musk responds, [Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999357298861486080)

What Musk is alluding to here is that because they pay for advertising, the News will cover nothing happening with these companies unless they have no choice because it's a massive scandal. Fossil fuels companies in particular have literally no other reason than this to advertise

* United States Coronavirus: 142,746 Cases and 2,489 Deaths ...

* Plenty of people have posted links claiming the US now has more cases than any other nation in the world... all Trump's fault of course.

But how can this be so?

China got hit first and harder than anyone else. The US has had the advantage of advance warning. How is it possible that America now has more cases then China (with 5x the population)?

Answer is simple. They don't. 

Internet says...

>Search Results
>Web results

>China Coronavirus: 81,470 Cases and 3,304 Deaths ...

To put it mildly, this is bullshit. Most nations have been honest in reporting their own CV19 situation. They can't test everyone and there appears to be a majority of asymptomatic cases that will never be known. But you can combine the numbers to get an average infection rate as a % of the total population. 

Epidemics don't distinguish between nationality and they progress according to factors based on biology and time.

So lets take a few countries and check the numbers. Say US, Italy, Spain, Germany, France and Iran.

* US has 325 million population and 145,000 cases

* Italy has 100k cases and total population of 61 million.

* Spain has 80k cases, and 46 million people

* Germany, 62k cases and 83 million people

* France, 40k cases, 67 million.

* Iran, 40k cases, 81 million. (But #cases might not be too accurate)

Next step is to divide cases by population to get prevalence as a % of total population.

In order: US 0.044%, Italy 0.164%, Spain 0.174%, Germany 0.075%, France 0.06% 

Now for the next step, we add these together to get an average. Doing so yields an average of 0.1034%.

Now for the last step, we take *that* number and apply it to China. This should give a very conservative result since China has had roughly a one month head start on everyone else.

0.1034% x 1.5 Billion (China's population) = **1.551 Million cases**. If you consider that CV19 cases have a way of doubling every couple of weeks, it's plausible to suppose that China's actual total might be 3 Million cases and possibly even 6 Million. Total mortality (at 1% average) would be 15,000 (low estimate) 30,000 (middle estimate) or even 60,000 (higher estimate)
[*Feel free to compare this number with the official figure on wikipedia that says about 80,000 cases*]. 

If the US manages to keep the total number of cases below a million, they'll be doing pretty good. 

Also remember next time someone tries to make the US look bad, you'll be in a much better position to judge that.

tldr; Numbers based on official stats/data from other countries suggest that the Chinese have been ""less than perfectly honest"" about their own corona situation.",conspiracy,Trump
31,Megathread: Ghislaine Maxwell (Epstein) documents unsealed. Important excerpts will be added here.,6622.0,i0zppc,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/i0zppc/megathread_ghislaine_maxwell_epstein_documents/,1324.0,1596163513.0,"***This post will be updated regularly as more is uncovered.  Dark to Light!***

In September 2015 Virginia Roberts Giuffre (VRG) sued Ghislaine Maxwell for defamation in New York federal court.  The documents unsealed today by Judge Preska are those that were filed under seal in that case in 2015.

There is overlap with older released documents, so some of this may not be new.  More will be released Monday.

(Edit: Two Clinton judges on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals [delayed release of the 2016 deposition] (https://www.newsweek.com/ghislaine-maxwell-deposition-release-delayed-appeals-court-1522099) until September 22.)

[**The source documents are here.**](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355835/giuffre-v-maxwell/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc)  The link may be down at times.

I am finding that all of the so called compilation PDFs, ZIPs, and dumps are incomplete or parts of the old Epstein docs of 2019.  [Exhibit 15 always seems to be missing, which implicates Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7010927/Virginia-Giuffre-Interview-2011.pdf) Only go to the source for the complete unsealed documents.  

[**These are the older Epstein files released in 2019, a 2,024 page PDF**](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6250471-Epstein-Docs.html).

There is some confusion about what documents are old and what is newly unsealed, which may be deliberate attempts to muddy the waters.

We are likely the largest sub left on reddit with this level of transparency, something which the mod team here is not often given enough credit for.

In addition to observing the behavior and activities of the individual /r/conspiracy mods, the mod log allows the occasional glimpse into what the reddit *admins* (paid employees of reddit) are removing from our sub.

The user base here does a remarkable job reporting content that violates the TOS, and the mod team is equally commendable when it comes to addressing each report.

As a result, when the admins intervene (under the name ""Anti-Evil Operations"" in the mod log), it increasingly has been for rather *dubious* reasons, to put it generously. We truly do run a tight ship here, and it's extremely frustrating to see the admins seemingly go out of their way to remove content that is often NOT in violation of reddit's Terms of Service (TOS).

With respect to Joe Biden, last year a parody site that made light of his alleged pervy predilections made its rounds on /r/conspiracy. Several months ago, the admin team swooped in and retroactively removed *all* comments and posts that contained this website's url.

The site is now on a ""hard* filter, so comments that link to it will be immediately removed. While it's certainly their prerogative to censor a parody site on behalf of a US politician, it reeks of a partisan approach to content management on reddit.

A more recent removal shows we are in new territory. A few days ago, a ZeroHedge article was posted here with the following title: 

**Confused Biden Calls Himself ""Obiden Bama"" & Says ""We Can Only Re-Elect Donald Trump""**

No comments in the thread were removed, and indeed all are in compliance with reddit's TOS. Therefore, the admin team must have determined that the *story itself* was in violation of the TOS.

There's no need to link the easily findable article directly, as the reddit admins have deemed it worthy of completely *purging* from /r/conspiracy, but let this serve as a stark reminder of what we're up against here. 

It doesn't take a conspiracy theorist to see this removal for what it is: Blatant election interference from one of the most influential social websites in the world.

Those actions, in and of themselves, represent a grievous threat to the free exchange of ideas and information on the modern internet.

While this is not something you can really prove, there are many oddities surrounding 9/11 as well as a synchronistic pattern hidden in pop culture that seems to point to this. In the movie Back to the Future, after the protagonist accidentally activates a time machine and alters the future, the Twin Pines Mall becomes the Lone Pine Mall. Notice how the clock reads 9:11 when flipped upside down.

[134 reads like hel when flipped upside too. Are we living in a bardo state like in the movie Jacob's Ladder or the show The Good Place?](https://preview.redd.it/mpvjh0olsor51.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b627f229519b5dd69408ae343894d17a2c304401)

Was this a reference to the Mandela Effect and the Twin Towers becoming the One World Trade Center? In the second Back to the Future movie, the protagonists accidentally create a new timeline where a wealthy man named Biff takes over their town. Biff lives in a skyscraper casino and turns their town into a chaotic dystopia. According to the screenwriter Bob Gale, Biff was based on Donald Trump. This is not a political statement, I’m just saying it’s odd how things turned out.

[I wonder if Bob Gale knew Trump would run for president?](https://preview.redd.it/8bo9ufr6tor51.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c67c76d0be49e4d19a4cb080d7b1326eb994343e)

In the Super Mario Bros. movie, a meteorite impact millions of years ago caused the universe to split into two timelines, the one we live in, and one where dinosaurs evolved into a humanoid race. President Koopa, a reptilian human hybrid, seems to be another caricature of Trump. President Koopa wants to merge his dimension with ours and attempts to rule Manhattan from the Twin Towers, which are portrayed as a gateway between worlds. The Super Mario franchise is strange when you think about shamans eating mushrooms to commune with serpent gods.

[Looks kind of similar, right?](https://preview.redd.it/qsuztr05uor51.jpg?width=933&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=007cb9d5ff5b3a443a6cf50b368cb3606b28ec7f)

There are many more examples of the WTC acting as a gateway. In an episode of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Twin Towers are used to transmit energy that propels the earth into another dimension. Take note of the sphere between the buildings, this will become relevant later. In the intro of Power Rangers: Time Force, a machine called the Time Shadow is seen standing on the towers. Take note of the moon in the background as well. This will become relevant too. During the final scene of Fringe season 1, the WTC is seen intact in a parallel universe.

Another interesting example can be found in Star Trek. In the show, space explorers are sent back in time to stop an alien invasion in the 1940s that altered the outcome of WWII and allowed the Nazis to invade the US. Once they kill the alien leader, one of the characters tells the protagonist that the timeline has corrected itself just as an image of the Twin Towers burning passes in the background.

[From Star Trek: Enterprise](https://preview.redd.it/u5o4vercvor51.jpg?width=679&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3b5d42d00e4e8e46a1c1f31565948aa51caa78f2)

The idea of a parallel world where the Nazis won WWII is very prominent in pop culture. But why is this? Is it possible creative people can intuitively sense other realities while absorbed in the act of creating? Philip K. Dick believed that’s what he did when he wrote The Man in the High Castle. He claimed:

*""I in my stories and novels sometimes write about counterfeit worlds. Semi-real worlds as well as deranged private worlds, inhabited often by just one person…. At no time did I have a theoretical or conscious explanation for my preoccupation with these pluriform pseudo-worlds, but now I think I understand. What I was sensing was the manifold of partially actualized realities lying tangent to what evidently is the most actualized one—the one that the majority of us, by consensus gentium, agree on.""*

Coincidentally, Philip K. Dick was one of the first modern thinkers to predict the Mandela Effect. He once declared:

*“we are living in a computer-programmed reality, and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed, and some alteration in our reality occurs.”*

The Nazis were rumored to be in possession of a time machine known as Die Glocke, or in English, The Bell. They were supposedly taught how to build this device by extraterrestrials and the craft was said to be kept in a facility known as Der Riese, or The Giant. It sounds far fetched, but The Nazi Party was actually formed from The Thule Society, an occult group that dabbled in channeling and other magical practices. They were also known to use the Black Sun symbol, an esoteric representation of a gateway into another dimension.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_Sun\_(symbol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sun_(symbol))

In Twin Peaks, a show about a small town caught in the midst of an interdimensional battle between good and evil, there seems to be a reference to Die Glocke. In season 8 there is a device that looks just like it, and at one point, a character called The Giant appears next to it.

[A conception of Die Glocke compared to the mysterious bell device in Twin Peaks.](https://preview.redd.it/gd4ml7mxvor51.jpg?width=710&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=df988856910a7ac4cd6bb2690d82a83ea3599bc8)

Twin Peaks is full of occult symbolism. In one episode a character is given instructions to find a portal that opens 253 yards east of Jack Rabbit’s Palace at 2:53 pm on October 1st. This portal is located in Washington. However, there is another in Las Vegas. Strangely enough, on October 1st, 2017, the Las Vegas shooting occurred in a lot 253 yards away from the Luxor Hotel, a giant black pyramid with the strongest beam of light in the world shooting out of it. Victims were mostly those attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival.

[There's also black pyramids on the instructions.](https://preview.redd.it/l5at0s4mwor51.jpg?width=876&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ee1f4f6c3965b08fc775919b0e8daeeae4f5f16d)

But it gets stranger. Jason Aldean was one of the headliners. If you look at his tattoos, there’s a Jack card and an Ace card underneath a black sun, which as mentioned earlier, is an occult symbol that represents a portal. This card from the Illuminati game is almost identical. A Jack is worth 10 points. An Ace is worth 1 point. This odd coincidence seems to be a reference to the date 10/1. Keep in mind this date looks like the number 101. This will become relevant too. But was the Route 91 Harvest a literal harvest of souls meant to energize a portal?

[This one is too much of a coincidence for me.](https://preview.redd.it/fxe2xktaxor51.jpg?width=543&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6733f9fce9bb186b98166d823c10ff325a2ec252)

The name Twin Peaks seems to be a reference to the Twin Pillars, a Masonic concept that originated from the Biblical idea of Boaz and Jachin, two pillars that stood on the porch of King Solomon's Temple. The Twin Pillars can be found in ancient architecture all over the world and are sometimes used in Tarot. They are said to represent a doorway into a higher realm. In this Masonic artwork, you can see the Black Sun between them.

[Jachin, Boaz, and the Black Sun.](https://preview.redd.it/ivg77smxxor51.jpg?width=389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cab85308fbc92b75b6c4d02dc7a57b887780fd4)

The Twin Pillars and the gateway in between can be represented by the number 101. In Twin Peaks, the entrance to The Black Lodge, a place that exists in another dimension, is depicted as a rabbit hole between two trees, which resembles a zero between two ones. In George Orwell’s famous novel 1984, Room 101 is a place where people’s worst fears come true. In The Matrix, Neo’s apartment number is 101. Here it’s interesting to note that he escapes the matrix by going in room 303. This year marks 303 years since Freemasonry was founded. Perhaps they will make their getaway come December? Many occult researchers claim the Twin Towers were supposed to represent the Twin Pillars. There even used to be a statue called The Sphere placed in between them, making the buildings resemble the 101 Gateway.

[The Black Lodge entrance from Twin Peaks and The Sphere centered between the Twin Towers.](https://preview.redd.it/7vkjantoyor51.jpg?width=1082&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2de6642831b124f565eaf68d00896721f29dd4d8)

Is it possible that the WTC‘s design was intended to create an interdimensional doorway using sacred geometry? Some say the Twin Towers even acted as a tuning fork. The buildings were wrapped in aluminum alloy with a resonant hollow interior. If you look at the picture above and to the right, you can kind of see how the sides of the towers even look like one. The Colgate Clock also once faced the WTC from across the water. If you’ve read my previous threads, you’ll probably notice it’s octagonal shape. Many portals in pop culture are portrayed as being 8 sided, like CERN, the largest particle collider in the world. Many conspiracy theorists speculate CERN is actually an interdimensional doorway. Some of the scientists working there have even said this. Why is there so much symbolism? Can it all really be just a coincidence at this point? Did 9/11 really alter our timeline?

[The Colgate Clock compared to CERN.](https://preview.redd.it/x8uqzf9rzor51.jpg?width=829&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d0403b2dc9be03d1db2963bca5f973278831b92e)

According to many people, 9/11 is the reason the Statue of Liberty’s torch is closed. However, this isn’t true. Lady Liberty’s torch has been closed for over 100 years. Yet, there are some people who claim to have visited it. But according to official history, this is impossible. In this reality, The Black Tom Explosion was the reason the Lady Liberty’s torch closed. The explosion occurred in 1916 and was one of the first foreign attacks on US soil prior to Pearl Harbor. The explosion was also one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever documented. The explosion was so powerful it caused the outer wall of Jersey City's city hall to crack and the Brooklyn Bridge to shake. Ironically, besides Lady Liberty’s torch, the explosion lodged shrapnel in the clock tower of The Jersey Journal building, stopping the clock at 2:12 am. It also caused windows miles away in Times Square to shatter. Perhaps the matrix was trying to tell us something. Was this a time shattering event?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_Tom\_explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Tom_explosion)

[https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d103887-r126254125-Statue\_of\_Liberty-New\_York\_City\_New\_York.html](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d103887-r126254125-Statue_of_Liberty-New_York_City_New_York.html)

Some people also claim they remember the Statue of Liberty being on Ellis Island. However, it has always been on Liberty Island. Once again, this is not something I recall learning in school. I’m sure some people do, but if my theory is correct, it’s because only some people in this timeline are from the old one. However, you can still find what appears to be residue left over from the previous reality.

[Residue from a previous reality?](https://preview.redd.it/h1aatrby0pr51.jpg?width=1087&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=147f204eccf3f45405ba44d3fd34f94a7316b098)

There are references in pop culture that seem to hint at the connection between the Mandela Effect and Lady Liberty as well. In the video game Assassin’s Creed Unity, the protagonist must find an exit portal to get himself out of a simulation. He finds it on the statue’s torch. In the movie Men in Black II, the statue’s torch is actually a giant Neuralyzer, a handheld device that uses a bright white flash to wipe people’s minds. At the end of the movie, the torch is activated and it illuminates the sky, erasing the memory of everyone in New York City.

[The scenes from Assassin's Creed and Men In Black II](https://preview.redd.it/166lnhsc1pr51.jpg?width=1159&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fbd79632c92ff8625e5ae12448d33deca880caa)

In the Netflix series The OA, a show about people who can jump between parallel universes, the Statue of Liberty shows up a lot. It seems to play an important role that was never really explained due to the show’s sudden cancellation. Some fans have pointed out that in one scene, Lady Liberty is holding her torch in the wrong hand. Some say this was just an error while others think it may have a deeper meaning.

[The Statue of Liberty scene from The OA.](https://preview.redd.it/gnuwo8et2pr51.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8dc1e1afaabdcc696721084e64249ac039a2a2ac)

In The OA, the protagonist searches for The Rose Window, an object she says acts like a portal to other dimensions. I find this very symbolic considering the Twin Pillar symbolism mentioned earlier. Many older cathedrals have huge rose windows centered between two tall towers.

[Old cathedrals with 101 Gateway symbolism built into the architecture.](https://preview.redd.it/t0xn2pd23pr51.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=159d2d98e86cfbeb118b49345acfd18dc0525c20)

If you’ve read my previous threads, you might have already made the connection that the 101 Gateway is another version of the Saturn Stargate. If you’re not familiar with the theory, we live in a simulation controlled by Saturn and the Moon, and The Elite are tying to break out. Our simulated reality is sometimes represented by a cube, and some say The Kaaba is one of these symbolic structures. The Kaaba sits between two pillars underneath a clocktower with a crescent moon on top.

[Kaaba at Mecca.](https://preview.redd.it/l6ccevsd3pr51.jpg?width=753&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9ddb9d2b46d06f437d4146cc07b8d18496a3b7b4)

Ironically, Fritz Koenig, the artist who created The Sphere sculpture between the Twin Towers, said The Kaaba was the inspiration behind his art installation. We can see this symbolism repeated in much of our pop culture as well.  In the video game Fortnite, a giant cube destroys a location called Tilted Towers then forms a portal in the sky. At another point in the game, it is revealed that the cube’s true form is a giant demon named the Storm King. His horns are reminiscent of a crescent moon.

[The second time you fight the Storm King its at a location called Twine Peaks lmao.](https://preview.redd.it/qpyaxton3pr51.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e1e9bbd00eb76751715408dacc3863361fb518c9)

But are there anymore significant Mandela Effects associated with the WTC? According to some people, Hurricane Erin never happened in their timeline. If you‘re unaware, like I was until recently, there was a massive hurricane headed right for New York on the morning of 9/11. Because of the events that occurred on 9/11, I understand how Hurricane Erin would be easy to forget. Nevertheless, the storm was strange. Hurricane Erin, which was slightly larger than Hurricane Katrina, received almost no media coverage as she charged toward New York City. On the morning of 9/11, just as the planes were about to hit, Hurricane Erin grew to her largest size, but slowed down and remained almost stationary off the East coast. But right after the WTC fell, she made a sharp right turn and headed back out to sea.

[Hurricane Erin on September 11th, 2001.](https://preview.redd.it/e3c1rj754pr51.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c07e6a9c5f7a1af998c15a1b74f211e28882fb57)

Hurricane Erin’s name is also interesting. The name Erin originated from Ériu, a goddess typically seen by the sea playing a harp. I find this curious becau HAARP uses extremely powerful radio frequencies to heat up the ionosphere and create clouds of plasma. Not only does this affect the climate, but the electromagnetic waves produced by it could hypothetically mess with our minds, perhaps changing or even erasing our memories. se many conspiracy theorists blame HAARP for both weather manipulation and the Mandela Effect.

In my last thread, I talked about MH370. I believe it’s disappearance, like the events discussed in this thread, was a part of a Saturn Stargate ritual. A sacrifice to the god of time. Would it be beyond the god of the fourth dimension to grant someone access to a wormhole? Perhaps The Elite are not purposely creating Mandela Effects and branching timelines. Perhaps it is just a side effect of trying to beak the matrix. But I digress. At the end of my last thread I said I would talk more about rabbit symbolism and its association with time travel. However, before I talk about that, or the Law of One, I thought I should talk about this first. Thanks for reading.

Oh yeah, in case you did read my last thread, check this out. The fact that this article was posted 2 weeks after my MH370 conspiracy post has me kind of spooked lol.

>William Edward Binney is a former intelligence official with the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and whistleblower. He retired on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency.  
>  
>He was a critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and later criticized the NSA's data-collection policies during the Barack Obama administration.  
>  
>Binney was a Russia specialist and worked in the operations side of intelligence, starting as an analyst and ending as a Technical Director prior to becoming a geopolitical world Technical Director. In the 1990s, he co-founded a unit on automating signals intelligence with NSA research chief Dr. John Taggart. Binney's NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. He has expertise in intelligence analysis, traffic analysis, systems analysis, knowledge management, and mathematics (including set theory, number theory, and probability).  
>  
>In September 2002, he, along with J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, asked the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting ""millions and millions of dollars"" on Trailblazer, a system intended to analyze mass collection of data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Trailblazer was a modification of ThinThread, removing the encryption and auditing aspects, while expanding the mass data collection. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded surveillance after the September 11, 2001 attacks that ""it's better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had"" as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread.

CrowdStrike chief admits no proof that Russia exfiltrated DNC emails:   [https://medium.com/@jasonaross/crowdstrike-and-russiagate-another-case-of-enormous-evidence-f53fd5fcc1c](https://medium.com/@jasonaross/crowdstrike-and-russiagate-another-case-of-enormous-evidence-f53fd5fcc1c)

Three key points that are essential to know.

1.) The modification times on the files point to the use of a FAT file system, which is used almost exclusively by storage devices (such as flash drives).

2.) Analysis of the files released by Guccifer 2.0 -- claimed to be the Russian hacker who got the files to Wikileaks -- reveals that they were created at a data transfer rate consistent with a flash drive, but not with an internet transfer.""

3.) The NSA would have known the hack was taking place, and would have direct evidence of it. We know this thanks to the leaks revealed by Edward Snowden, which the NSA has never denied.

I never see any Nazi flags, confederate flags, trump flags, any of that in the large groups. But the front page of Reddit has been littered with tightly cropped photos of one person, or a handful of people holding these flags. They title it to make it seem like these are the people who are running this protest, but it's always very few people with no context as to where they are or if they are even affiliated with the protest. It's so obvious what reddit is trying to do and it's amazing how fast the opposition to the movement can mobilize these bad actors to try and discredit this movement as a bunch of racist Nazis. Don't let reddit, and soon to be msm, fool you into thinking this is what's happening, because it's not.

If we could just stop all the shenanigans and start working together instead of against each other, helping fellow beings instead of kicking while they are down, we would all be in a far better place.

We are, in essence, all the same, just different individuations of this essence and some of those individuations need more help than others to realize this.

Why do so many people fall for the campaign of hate all the time and don't just stop and think for a moment? 

Property,  Religion,  Borders, all those tools are being used to give you a reason to hate. 

If you truly feel superior over another being, then give that superiority a good use and help the other being achieve a similar state. For every service you do for another being is also a service for yourself, but in a positive way. 

All this hate and anger have gotten way out of hand.

Edit: Thank you for all of your responses, I hope that all of you who haven't found the positivity will find it soon. 

I feel like I have to explain a little bit more:

What I meant to say was don't get caught up too much in ""the system"" just live a positive life and be the beacon of light for others. You always get what you give, so if you do not only speak in a positive way, but honestly act positive without expecting anything in return, life will give it back to you in a positive way.

Edit2: A lot.of positive people here, I am really enjoying it! 
According to other responses it seems like I am a paid jewish fascist communist hippie whore who supports Obama and Trump and promotes an NWO and deserves to get shot in the genitals.
This is just what I meant by saying the rage towards other parties has gotten out of control. People, you are better than that!",conspiracy,Trump

You joked about us. You called us *nutcases.* You called us ""tinfoil-hatters"". You downvoted us on sites like Reddit and in other comments sections. You cheered in glee as moderators removed our comments. And yet now, after the Epstein case, most of you are beginning your comments with ""I'm not a Conspiracy Theorist but..."". Oh how the turn tables have...naah, I'll skip the meme for a change.  

Let me educate you about a pattern that we've all observed. First - they call it a conspiracy theory. Then - once the truth starts trickling out, they say, ""Oh c'mon! This was never really a conspiracy theory. Everyone with a brain knew that.""  

There was a time when nobody believed that the US was doing extremely inhuman things to people as part of their defense experiments. It was just us ""tinfoil hatters."" Then, it all turned out to be true. Then everyone was like, ""Meh. Everyone knew about it."" Then the same thing happened when us ""nutters"" warned people that they were being electronically spied on. Again, the story repeated. Then we warned the world about Elite Paedophiles and their horrifying Satanic Ritual Sacrifices. The former is now front page news. The latter will eventually follow. It has to. There is no going back past this point in our spiritual evolution.  

Many of you still don't believe the truth about 9/11. ""Jet fuel does not break steel memes"", ""7/11 was an inside job"", ha ha ha. You still refuse to see how the media makes a fool out of anyone calling out 9/11 BS. Just like many of you haven't noticed as to how quickly the majority of media sources put out the Jeffrey Epstein ""killed himself"" headline. Similarly, you probably still haven't noticed as to how the r/911truth subreddit got mercilessly quarantined by Reddit - with a lot of cheers coming their way for that. The exact same Reddit, which is also combing interesting comments calling out the Epstein ""suicide"" BS across r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, and like a shit ton of other places. But soon, I assure you all, I'll hear you say, ""Oh c'mon! Everyone has been saying Bush did 9/11 since like forever.""  

So there's the facts. I know that you are going to continue making fun of us ""tinfoil hatters"" or whatever or say that we are only forwarding some specific political party's agenda (I'll be honest here - there are many on this sub who do have such agendas. But NOT ALL of them are like that.) You are also going to cheer out loud if/as/when Reddit blocks us for having a (planted) hate post or comment or literally anything else in the future - in much the same manner as violent folks get ""planted"" to discredit peaceful protests, which are then quashed violently by the cops in ""retaliation"". You are also going to laugh as your rights get taken away and eventually, your dignity and safety and everything else you hold dear. So here are a few more things for you to know of right away - so that the next time you claim that ""everyone knew it perfectly well all along"" - at least we ""*retarded tinfoil hatters""* can *buy that shit.*  

1. ALL of your media is controlled. ALL news is planted. ALL headlines are perfectly chosen to brainwash you in a specific way. So, the next time you ""debunk"" something by giving out a ""source"" i.e. a ""trustworthy news link"" - you are fooling nobody. And don't even get me started on *Snopes* and their agenda.  

2. If you still think that you are living in a ""democracy"", where things happen by rule (unlike Russia/China/North Korea which are evil places manipulated by evil folks) - I may have some bad news for you. The Epstein incident should be eye-opener enough for you.  

3. Nearly all shootings that happen in your country of US are *manipulated* to achieve the gun-control objective. So that people have no means to defend themselves when the government ultimately decides to invade them. Trial runs of these things are managed in countries such as New Zealand - which was a massive success because their (both literal as well as metaphorical) ""sheep population"" willingly bought it in one go. Either psychologically imbalanced individuals are targeted, drugged, brainwashed and manipulated into doing this or hired sharpshooters are dedicated to the cause. Other side-objectives such as having a shooter of <insert race/religion here> are also achieved simultaneously for the purpose of spreading hate and fear.  

4. You have been lied to regarding the TRUTH about MH 370 and the MH 17 incidents. Yep, your folks had had something (all of it) to do with that.  

5. The entire 9/11 story is a fabrication.  

6. The British Royal Family, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Trumps, and, sorry to add, even Bernie Sanders are all part of the same elite circles that do horrible things. Because unless you aren't a part of the elite, you wouldn't even get CLOSE to the presidential race, let alone the presidential nomination.  

7. Feminism/feminists is manipulated and controlled by these folks to create further gender-wars and divide. (You can see how manipulated they are that they actually try to sell you the ridiculous idea that the Burqa/Hijab/Niqab is some form of women's empowerment). The response to it (Meninism) is also ""founded and run"" by these same folks. Black people, White people, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians - ALL are attacked under the orders of the very same people. If you have seen women replacing men as superheroes and other characters in movies (Ghostbusters, Oceans 8) - it is part of that DIVIDE AND CONQUER agenda. Gender pay gap is also a part of that exact same agenda. Meanwhile, they continue to oppress women on the side by denying them abortion rights, mistreating them etc and play both sides of the game. The same applies to black guys suddenly getting to play originally white characters. It's all manufactured to generate outrage, divide and rule. **[This ad is an excellent example of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0)**  

8. *Nearly* all rich and famous folks (the coveted 1%) are part of the ""dark side"" in some way or the other. Yes - you are going to see folks of the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffet for what they TRULY are to get ousted pretty soon. Don't say we didn't warn you later.  

9. Forced vaccination is a plan for something a lot, a LOT more nefarious than Autism. The Autism nonsense is just to keep people distracted from the real deal.  

10. Point no.9 mentioned above and Elon Musk's Neuralink are, well, *linked* very closely.  

11. Sorry, but global warming is a hoax too. These people you have put all of your faith in - these scientists, these researchers, these ""experts"" - when their true allegiances are revealed to you, you are going to feel, really, really stupid. The real thing that is causing a lot of this world's problems is something known as HAARP - but hey, can't have YOU FOLKS knowing THAT now, can we?  

12. If you see someone's image being marketed as that of a ""good guy"" for *far too long* - expect it to be the exact opposite in reality. Looking at you, Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Malala, United Nations and NATO.  

13. Some people take on a ""good guy image"" (Elon Musk). So that once the public fully begins to trust their intentions, they can give you your personalized eternal slavery toolkits such as Neuralink™.  

14. People like Alex Jones - and the real-life ""tinfoil hatters"" have been created to discredit/mock the actual awakened *conspiracy community*. Yes, we do have some folks who believe in baseless stuff without anything legitimate to back that up, but they are not the majority.  

15. This is the opposite of point #12. People who DO speak the truth, are branded by the powers-in-control as loons, addicts, or retards. Whatever suits their causes the best. E.g. Jim Carrey, Russel Brand, Kanye West, etc. Can't have these folks spilling all the beans now, can they?  

16. Celebrities who DO wish to tell the world the truth get killed. Usually through the kind of technologies that killed Osho (via giving him cancer), or the stuff that has been used to drain Julian Assange of his very life force (he'll probably not live too long either), and so on and so forth. They killed Michael Jackson. They also killed Robin Williams. And they also ""suicided"" a bunch of bankers not too long ago. Sometimes, they just shoot them in plain sight like they did with that one President dude called Kennedy.  

17. The Large Hadron Collider/Particle Accelerator had WAY more nefarious purposes than what you'd ever believe to be true.  

18. We have had the technology (obtained by reverse engineering) to visit Moon/Mars/Outer Reaches of our Solar System since a LONG, LONG time. So while the Moon mission wasn't exactly fake - it didn't show to the world what we really have. Or how often we use what we have to travel through this Solar System at mind-bending speeds.  

19. The Moon isn't what you think it is.  

20. Last but not the least, aliens exist. Always have. And many of them are literally light years ahead of us - both technologically, as well as spiritually. Deal with it.  

This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list. I just dropped the most important things that came to my mind at this time. There are many, many, many, many more things I could tell you but that would go on forever.  

Long story short, don't you *for a single second* believe that you are living in a world that is any different than what was described in the book 1984. Don't you *for a single second believe* that ""Russia"" is the only evil, dictatorial place where people get ""suicided"" and America's some kind of a *heaven.* Really, just *don't.* Because all of your delusions are about to get uprooted, real fast, real hard.  

All of your bankers, your pharma companies, your petroleum companies, your Nestle's and McDonalds and Cokes, your fancy fashion brands, your media, your educational systems, your scientific fraternity, your governments, your armies, your spy services, your police forces, your military-industrial complex, your religions, your politicians, your ""justice"" systems, and your *everything* is corrupted to its very core. This applies across countries, across borders, across the world. The ones of lesser light see humanity as slaves - and are wiling to do anything to use us for their greed, lust and even entertainment. **You have been manipulated physically, psychologically, socially and even** ***CHEMICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY*** **to the extent that even your DNA and your VERY SOUL has not remained untouched by their advanced nefarious technologies.**  

It is up to you to either sit in quiet acceptance of it, or to **do something about it before it takes away everything you have ever loved or valued.**  

**DISCLAIMER:** Just because evil has infiltrated and rotted everything in existence, does not mean that there are no good people left. In fact, without the good people, our world would be a 100% hell right now. So let me make it very, very clear that GOOD PEOPLE STILL DO EXIST. In your politics, in your Nestles and Cokes, in your police forces, in your armed forces, in your governments, in your spy forces, in your media, in your judicial systems, in your scientific field, in your educational fields, in your NASA, in your UN and even in your religions. Without these folks being there to balance things out, we'd all probably be COMPLETELY FUCKED AS A SPECIES by now. But these good people are usually powerless because as of yet, Earth is still under the rule of darker forces (such as the Illuminati etc) - and other good people from all across the world haven't joined hands yet to become a SINGLE, POWERFUL, INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE that the negative ones COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH. Because most of them are still buying into all those hate and division games. The day they wake the fuck up, is the day we'll be liberated as a species...  

Have a good day.  

**EDIT:** To those asking me to give proofs of my claims, or asking me to explain to them more about the moon, the Hadron Collider etc. I am *so not* going to do any of that. Try living **our life** for once. Go into the rabbit-holes of the internet, the YouTubes, the blogs and even the 4chans and the 8chans that you so despise. **READ** people's arguments for yourselves. **ANALYSE** the evidences presented. **FIGURE THINGS OUT** on your own. **THAT'S HOW YOU WILL AWAKEN.**  

Not by someone spoon-feeding you everything and you either (blindly) buying it, or else (blindly) rejecting it. THAT MENTALITY is what has got all of us here in the first place. Where everybody (blindly) believes their media, their governments, their politicians, their scientists, their celebrities, their teachers, their religious leaders and even their psychologists. Where everybody (blindly) believes in their society, their friends, their moms, their dads, their siblings and absolutely anyone else - WITHOUT GOING OUT THERE AND LOOKING UP/VERIFYING SHIT FOR THEMSELVES. And then we have a sleeping civilization that will believe in *literally anything.* Sorry, ain't gonna contribute to that madness.  

**EDIT 2:** So I found a few recurring themes/questions coming up within this post. I would be more than happy to address some of those.  

**Question 1:** Why you no provide proof?  

**Answer 1:** Hold it right there. Do you really think that when conspiracy theorists were making claims about Jeffrey Epstein WAY back - that they were doing so without posting proof? Oh, let me give you a better example. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (along with us ""nutcases"") were *screaming from rooftops* telling people they were being spied on. Entire troves of documents and other *proofs* accompanied their words. Did you all for a single second believe them? No, right? And what happened ultimately? They were proven all right, right? So don't you for a *single second* feign all of that ""innocence"" and *ask me for proofs* now when all you have done is *disregard* proofs for the entirety of your lives. Besides, we are all just *nutcases* here right? Why would you even believe someone you have already labelled a nutcase? That would be ridiculous.  

**Question 2:** But muh Donald Trump is *innocent.*  

**Answer:** *Is he?* Kindly go look up his attitude towards Saudi Arabia, his trigger-happy, war-friendly stance towards Iran, and report back to me regarding his true allegiances at your leisure. Get out of this ""Republican good, Democrat bad"" and ""Democrat good, Republican bad"" nonsense already. Because while you are busy defending their asses here, they are all just thinking of newer and better ways to trample yours. Yes, both of them. Sorry to break that to ya.  

**Question 3:** Do you really believe in Satan, it's 2019?  

**Answer 3:** Accepting that Satanic Rituals exist is not the same thing as accepting Satan exists. There are plenty, plenty of stories, witness accounts and testimonials about those out there. **Entire books have been written about the said rituals - and MANY at that.** And where there's smoke - there's usually fire. Go figure.  

**Question 4:** Doesn't your mentioning the moon completely ruin the whole point of this post?  

**Answer 4:** This one's the one that brought me the most laughs. Because I haven't even mentioned a *single theory* about the moon in this post. I haven't said whether the moon is hollow or not, or whether it is flat or not, or whether it is a ""projection"" or not. And yet, people here are already, well, ""projecting"" rather hard about what I *might have* intended to say. Perhaps it is indeed a projection then? Lol.  

See, this is why I left some of the stuff here open-ended. So that you lot here can come and project your preconceived notions and prejudices about such topics yet again. So that you can (already) decide as to what is ""believable"" and what sounds way too ""out there"" for your tiny minds to comprehend. But hey, there was a time when the idea that the government was spying on you was way too *""out there""*. Go figure.  

**Question 5:** Yes to everything except the Vaccination Part, the Global Warming part and the <insert name of concept ""sold"" to you by your mainstream media, social media, literally all scientists, literally all celebrities, literally all your friends, and even your neigbhbour's 3-day old puppy>.  

**Answer 5:** So you have already decided that you know everything about those topics. And clearly, since absolutely everyone upon this planet accepts them - they can't all be wrong, right?  

Let me give you an example to illustrate this point a tad better. Almost everyone on your planet agrees that believing in fairy tales and magic and any other ""out there"" concepts is either for kids or druggies or for complete retards. That believing in ""imaginary stuff"" makes you immature, stupid and dumb AF. **Strange then, that nearly all (so-called) ""mature, grown adults"" upon this planet** who are all intelligent ""homo-sapiens and everything"" **believe in imaginary borders, imaginary separations** between religion, creed, race, gender and whatnot **and buy all of those imaginary dreams** such as the American Dream/or that the ""media never lies"" and more. How wise and mature of them.  

**Question 6:** Why the fuck would the elite do all of this shit openly? They knew the entire country was watching them here. They'd be stupid to even try.  

**Answer 6:** Two reasons. I'll address the first one first. The reason that our Elite do a lot of things is NOT about whether it's the best thing to do or not. The reason is to remind the world just how very fucking powerful and untouchable they are. That they can get away with **absolutely anything,** right in front of humanity's noses and people will still buy all their BS and suck on their dicks at the end of the day. This is why they were so happy about ""predicting 9/11"" in like a ton of different places (yeah, WAY too many ""coincidences"" happening in there for all of these things to be organically happening) be it comics, cartoons, movies, or what-have-you. Manipulating entertainment to suit their agenda is something they have always done. The guys over at Disney would love to tell you how well they've all gotten at this shit. **They are ALL on the power-trip of a lifetime where no matter WHAT they do and HOW BLATANTLY THEY DO IT - humanity all laps it up and** ***worships*** **them regardless.** THIS IS WHY they thought offing Epstein right under the entire world's noses was a good idea. Alas! Times are a changin - and they are changing fast! And as their ship is fast sinking now, expect them to do many, many more such stupid things in desperation that only have an opposite effect to that which they had intended. For, as that recent movie title would gladly remind you, we are truly in the ""Endgame"" now. And nope, that title was no ""coincidence"" either.  

The reasons they do all of those horrifying paedo-sex-and-torture-ritual-cult-blood-sacrifice ceremonies is NOT because all of them were organically born as child rapists. The reasons they do it is for their *initiation.* To filter out the darkest from the dark. For only the greatest of psychopaths and monsters can even as much as *imagine* participating in one of those psychotic ceremonies. And then they continue to force these ""initiates"" into doing this on a regular basis to forever ensure that these people are still ""on their (dark) side"" and as leverage against them if any of them ever decides to turn against them. Hope this is making some sense to you now.

**Question 7:** Why TF are you making all of these tall claims? YOU are the one discrediting the community now.  

**Answer 7:** AM I? Here's a suggestion. Save this post. Try your best to survive for the next 10 years. Okay, let's just make it 5 years. And then, watch in horror as a ton of things mentioned herein get revealed to you. I hope 5 years isn't too much of a stretch for you. Because this entire revealing process might well take a 50 or even a 100. Why? Because the hiding has been going on for entire fucking millenia. So for the revealing to just take about a 100 is a massive achievement already. But I am not saying you have to wait that long. **You will get more than what you bargained for within the next 5 years alone.** That I guarantee you. So yeah, go convert this thread into a checklist. And begin ticking off items as and when they happen. I assure you, *I* won't be the one disappointing you here. Can't really say the same for your leaders, your businessmen, your doctors, your scientists, your judges, your media, etc. though.",conspiracy,Trump

Do people really believe that half the country is actively racist and is openly colluding and working to oppress minorities based on ignorant beliefs? How did Obama ever get into office? How come the government wasn't dismantled or destroyed when he was elected?

And another question I have. Once the opportunity came to elect a new non-racist president in the United States came around why did the party making racism it's main issue vote in an old white person? Like I mean a wonderbread, mayonnaise loving white person? Why do people believe Donald Trump, a man celebrated around the country while Obama was in office, is less of a racist threat than Joe Biden? Both are white aren't they? Both are white men? 

Are there no potential black candidates in the country anymore? Is it racism that caused Joe Biden to be voted in?

** Thanks everyone, the comments are very encouraging. Sounds like the parties and media (big surprise) do not truly or factually represent what is happening in the US on the ground with the citizens. Peace and Love to everyone. Breathe and respect!

** some people have pointed out how some ignorant ideas are expressed in this post and I can see and agree. That is how communication can work. Others have expressed anger that really appears to be rooted in hatred and it really demonstrates what is so confusing. You cannot out hate hate. And so if you are being motivated into hating someone, something, some group then understand your message is lost. You become convinced that the only way to ""win"" is to violently dominate those who don't agree. Racism without hatred is a stereotype. And we all make generalizations about groups of people due to lack of information. Share information without hate. it would turn this world around if Americans could come together in peace, stop the wars and killing together. Stop what you are doing as a country around the world that doesn't promote peace and unity and then you will heal internally. It is the same for every country but often it seems like there is more opportunity for the US to do this. There is more influence on the world.

*** Racism exists around the world. Racism exists in the US and people suffer it every single day. For many people suffering racism it is the most important and pressing issue. But not everyone. I still have many of the same questions. Looking for answers from Americans. Obviously not everyone agrees! It is hatred that makes people support the military violently dominating killing and destroying people and families from other countries. No good comes from dropping bombs. Speak out against nationalistic violent domination and calls for ending racism is delivered with more authority. If you support or defend or rationalize the killing of people in other countries by your country's military you are by definition an ignorant racist. Don't whine about immigration policy without screaming about the ongoing violent domination done in your name around the world. If you are white just stop with the virtue signaling. You want to share your privilege and show you understand? Then start screaming for peace until every single bomb has stopped. If white people are in control of the US then the military policy is their greatest shame and seems to be a policy both parties share except in presentation and pandering. Black people in Libya, Iraq, Africa have all been murdered by US military. Muslims have been murdered for 3 decades by the US military. 

And the reason white people will make a bigger deal over immigration policy than war in the middle east is because they are scared to stand up. They are scared to lose the REAL privilege they have. Being vocal about immigration and racism is EASY for white people in America. Being pro-peace is not.  Because if you want to see someone marginalized and destroyed then watch an influential white person who stands up against the military policy of all parties. I hope and pray Democrats find their roots in a real peace movement and start doing the hard work. And I hope the trump supporters who are anti-war support them 100%.

[The transcription of the full speech](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/remarks-on-the-clinton-campaign-of-destruction)

I have always found for myself and others that reading, has a bigger impact on conveying a message rather than watching someone speak to you from a television screen.

*Why is this on r/conspiracy?*

Well first of all he uses the word conspiracy twice. Second of all, I believe this is the first time in a critical moment of history we've had a Presidential Candidate calling the establishment a criminal cartel along with the media conspiring against the people of America. Regardless of what you believe to be the truth I thought it important that as truth seekers you all had an opportunity to read this and apply to the puzzle we all try to piece together on a daily basis.

All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

The policy was designed 33 years ago to protect trade secrets in a highly competitive industry. But critics -- including the Obama administration -- say the secrecy has grown out of control, making it impossible for regulators to control potential dangers or for consumers to know which toxic substances they might be exposed to. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/03/AR2010010302110.html

'This sub really started to nose dive around the DNC leaks, Seth Rich, and most importantly.... The podesta emails in regards to 'pizzagate'

This doesn't mean the sub sucks because these theories and posts started. It was these theories and posts with (Imo)  sooooo much evidence to support them in turn brought in complete idiot accounts and people in to this community to discredit us and those theories. I mean Jesus christ guys, they shut down the pizzagate sub all together and then we had to go to Voat to discuss it. Imo- the DNC leaks proved that DNC rigged the primaries for Hillary against Bernie. Imo Seth rich was the leaker. Bang bang. Nothing like a good ol' random shotgun to the back at 4am with nothing stolen. And pizzagate... Well come on. If you have 1 brain cell and you did you research.. You know what's up.

**Editing to add:**

Man oh man. The psychosis is causing meltdowns lol!

Top comment heard from at least 25 different redditors with “unique” opinions:

> That catchphrase is just popular because of comedian Joe Rogan. 


But these delusional dolts are forgetting how Dr Malone, a genius doctor who created the groundwork for the experimental mrna, phrased in a really eloquent on a Joe Rogan Podcast heard by 80 million people, how this country is full of blind idiots losing their fucking minds by taking experimental gene therapy with absolutely zero long term research. 


This phrase is causing mental breakdowns in logic as redditors are seething and coping because now Dr Malone’s eloquent way of explaining their neurosis is popular and they don’t want to be stereotyped as delusional religious nuts for $cience

**Second edit**

For the Vaxxed worried that hey maybe this vaccine is going to harm me since there is no long term data and Pfizer sucks dick at making drugs that work safely, here’s a list of items that I recommend you have in your cabinet if you start noticing autoimmune flare ups like eczema, eye redness, skin legions, or a cold that won’t go away, it could be a sign of Antibody Dependent Enhancement, something Dr Malone correctly predicted as an outcome for the vaccinated as new variants developed:

* PQQ
* Daily aspirin or eat garlic daily
* Milk thistle can help too
* Regeneron, yes, the trump touted regeneron that was mocked is now currently in clinical trials as a treatment for the ADE as well as for symptoms of spike proteins. 
* Prayer. Seriously, start praying because even the cdc is only relying on hope at this point since their is no data that the boosters will help you. Probably won’t, so seriously start praying it does. 

For the unvaxxed looking to boost their immune system without becoming a lab rat, add these to your medicine cabinet: 

*  Liposomal vitamin C
* vitamin d3+k2
*  vitamin b6
*  zinc
*  omega-3
*  beta glucans
*  l-lysine
*  n-acetyl cysteine (NAC)
*  selenium
*  elderberry 
*  Ahcc

Edit2: replace the word rights with forced choice if that's what you need to understand my point.

Edit 3: since this has blown up I will say the word hate was strong, I don't want to spread hate. I should say I strongly dislike them both. As far as rights go I addressed that in the last two edits. 
As far as being an antivax and antidem. I voted for Biden although I wish I voted 3rd party. I also am not antivax I am fully vaccined I just think THIS vaccine was rushed to fast and currently isn't what I would classify as working. So I am not ready to put it into my body. I think if you want to get it, you go for it. I just want the choice without my family being put into a financial hardship. 
It's funny you can very clearly see the two sides in a post just asking if anyone else feels they don't have a side.

They're like Denace the Menace only they have machine guns.

John Potash writes in his acclaimed book ""Drugs as Weapons Against Us"" that the CIA's Project SPAN involved ""the 1951 aerosol spraying of LSD on the town of Pont-St. Esprit, France, which resulted in several deaths and many injuries.""

The CIA also tested anthrax-like spores in various American cities, and may have used actual anthrax during the Korean War.  Maybe I'll write about this later, or someone else will I hope.

Anyone else suddenly seeing military helicopters flying overhead for the first time?  I remember in 1990 in the buildup to Papa Bush's Desert Storm incursion into Kuwait to fight Iraqi troops (remember Papa Bush never did invade Iraq, just entered Kuwait) that I'd see day after day lots of military truck traffic on South Kingshighway as I would drive to Forest Park and Washington University's library.  

I've lived in the same house for 25 years, and I've never once seen military helicopters flying around.  Maybe once every 2 to 6 months, I'll hear and see fast-moving military jets and planes high above, but never helicopters.  On Monday and Tuesday of this week, I suddenly saw low-flying copters for the very first time.  On Monday, a big copter was flying south-southwest, possibly flying directly over my house or pretty close.  Then Tuesday, I heard and saw a military helicopter a few minutes before 11 AM flying in the exact opposite direction (north-northeast).  I don't recall the color of Monday's copter but Tuesday's had a brown bottom.  Never seen copters in this suburb of St. Louis prior to this week.  I wonder what's up.  

I hope the Deep State hasn't blackmailed or forced Trump into invading Syria.  I haven't had a reason in months to drive on South Kingshighway, so I don't know if there's lots of military truck movements there again like in 1990.  

I hope them copters ain't spraying cancer chemicals over my house. Lol.  Just kidding.  But again, the CIA, in an experiment, did spray LSD over an unsuspecting French town in the 1950s to see what would happen.  And a few people actually died.  I'm sure the U.S. Junta got permission from the French Junta to use the town in the experiment.  After all, the CIA helped install the secret French Junta in the 1950s and they nearly brought down French Premiere Charles DeGaulle in 1962 or so.  DeGaulle went on the radio urging French citizens to come out onto the streets in massive demonstations to resist the combined CIA and French Junta overthrow of his government (I read that years ago in William Blum's book, ""The CIA: A Forgotten History"").  Similarly, we saw just last year Turkey's elected leader implore Turkish citizens to come out and demonstrate against the CIA-supported Turkish military coup that tried to overthrow the Turkish government in a coup last summer.  And Turkey has always been a U.S. ally.

And if it weren’t guns, it would be knives, bombs, running people over with vehicles. There’s a deep evil and mental sickness growing in our society due to lack of resources, love, education, growing poverty and homelessness. I think we should all ask ourselves, why did “X” do “Y”.  What drives a person to commit such evil acts in the first place?

America has had its identity and culture erased. There’s no solidarity. China preaches China and its people above all. Same with many Latin America countries where poverty is all encapsulating, but there is the social and community bond intact. America doesn’t have that due to the constant political divide as well as wealth divide. You’ve got like 4 countries all trying to live within one. It shouldn’t, but as history shows, this inevitably leads to divide, hatred, and violence in communities. Our real problems are not our differences, that’s what makes us human. 

The funny thing is, there shouldn’t be any divides. Gay, straight, black, white, Latino, Native American, Spanish speaking, English speaking, male female, it’s all over nothing.

Our common enemy are the corporations and politicians that pillage our communities in their own selfish desire to remain in power and amass more wealth. Love always wins over hate, and unfortunately all of our hate is aimed and directed at ourselves, and not the ones ruining our opportunities and wellbeing in life.

My heart truly breaks man. It upsets me so much that society has fallen so far. Terrorism. Biowarfare. War. Racism. Hatred and divide. And it’s almost always caused by deeper, nefarious agendas by the wealthiest politicians and corporate members. The propaganda. The lies. The corruption. While the rest of us suffer at the mercy of their selfish desires and decision making.

Tonight, despite our differences, I want every one of you reading this to know you are valued, you are loved, you are not alone.

For awhile the collective opinion was that people who refused the shot were conspiracy theorist, stupid or misinformed. Now however, the common sentiment has changed to outright hatred. Less of a ""good luck dieing dumb dumb"" and more of a ""fuck you unvaccinated peace of shit. I want you erased from this fucking planet!""

I'm honestly scared of where this is heading. If people can be manipulated to hate their friends and neighbors this easily, how far could the government and the media take it?

We've already seen conservatives become likened to Nazis. Today people would feel more embarrassed to say they voted for Trump than to say that they have a drug problem. I honestly don't feel comfortable sharing my beliefs around people I'm close with anymore for fear of getting ganged up on and dismissed as an idiot.

I disagree with the Right on a whole fuckton of things - especially re: religion and the role of government in the economy. 

I wholeheartedly supported Bernie, twice. 

And, for the record, I specifically disagreed with the stated motivations for those Trump supporters being there in the first place: trying to pressure congress into investigating voter fraud.

*With that said:*

I watched 8 hours of live footage on that day from multiple sources and I know *for a fact* that violence was brought to those protesters by people using black bloc tactics. 

I watched it happen *in real time.*

There is hours and hours of footage that has been withheld to specifically help support a narrative that was patently manufactured.

And every single time footage does arise it is quickly pulled down.

In fact, this whole ridiculous January 6th narrative has done more to make me question my side's intentions and motivations than anything else short of what the DNC did to Bernie (twice).

There is footage of cops opening gates to let people in.

There is footage of security guards *in the capitol building* smiling, holding the door open and taking selfies with the protestors *as they enter the capitol*.

There is footage of protestors entering the building and calmly walking through, waving flags and respecting property.

Ask yourself: if this ""attack"" was so bad, why, when all of these protestors were inside the building, was the capitol not ransacked, permanently defaced or specifically burned? 

The government is desperately trying to portray this as if it's some modern day Reichstag fire but it's just not true.

The most notable thing that happened inside that whole building, after hours of protesting, was that *one single woman* got shot, Nancy Pelosi got her laptop stolen and a dipshit in a Viking hat waved a flag.

Outside is outside. 

Protestors were INSIDE the building for hours and fuck all actually happened in the grand scheme of things.

I have followed the Hunter Biden saga for years. Allow me to sum up and address some of the disinformation that is part of the modified limited hangout being run.

First, there are 3 pictures that have been making the rounds that are intentional disinformation:

1) Natalie Biden with cocaine on her nose. It's not Natalie. Sure, it's a striking resemblance, but it's verified as being a cam girl. The shills use this to say ""the data is fake"" but, really, their argument is what's fake. Anyone with the data knows this picture isn't real.

2) Joe Biden with asian girl. This is actually a BDSM video from xvideos that has been around for years. The face of the old man is clearly visible in portions of the video and is, in fact, not Joe Biden. Shills love to use this type of disinfo to muddy the waters.

3) Hunter Biden with five young girls. This is not Hunter Biden, as Hunter Biden has never sported a black soul patch. Shills are using this to poison the well and distract from the corruption.

Is Hunter Biden a pedo? Yes. He searches for underage porn. He is constantly accused of being a child molester. He sleeps with Natalie Biden. He sleeps with young cousin Lilly. He engages in grooming behavior and is likely providing drugs to underage family members.

https://i.redd.it/t7lectnjpza91.png

There do appear to be nudes of Natalie in the data.

But, his criminality doesn't stop there. I get that people want the salacious stuff, first, but keep in mind, Hunter Biden participates in policy decisions with the President of the United States.

In early 2019, Hunter Biden's Rosemont Seneca email password, along with all Rosemont Seneca passwords were leaked.  Even prior to that, the corruption surrounding Hunter Biden and Rosemont Seneca was already widely reported on.

In fact, we see an extension of these globalist type plans for American resources plain as day in Hunter's data.

https://i.redd.it/ha341tgur5b91.png

I don't really have an opinion on the originating laptop dropped off for repair, but I suspect that the leak was inevitable because Hunter Biden's accounts were already compromised by run-of-the-mill Internet investigators. The flood gate was already opened. From where I sat, I was concerned the laptop repair story was exceedingly convenient. But, whatever.

In October 2020, the first drip occurred publicly. I was sent a mega link that is now expired, that contained some of the laptop material.

This was (approximately) the first sample I received. It is SFW and the most damning thing is evidence of a wire transfer from Chinese Intelligence asset to Hudson West III LLC. The rest was a bit random.

https://pic8.co/a/02bddee7-bdef-44ec-8cc4-0197cfad55e9/

Less than a week later, I was sent a much larger collection of images, this time with EXIF data and other corroborating information that showed the majority of what I was looking at was authentic.

We already know the emails and banking records are real per the FOIA request. A number of emails can also be verified with DKIM authentication and also by being able to see both sides of the conversation (like with Devon Archer's emails from his own account to and from Hunter Biden.)

>DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail) is an email authentication technique that allows the receiver to check that an email was indeed sent and authorized by the owner of that domain. This is done by giving the email a digital signature. This DKIM signature is a header that is added to the message and is secured with encryption.

https://www.dmarcanalyzer.com/dkim/

This second, larger set of files included a massive amount of salacious content. The shills surrounding this controversy love to focus on Hunter Biden's genitals in order to distract from the corruption. Indeed, a file named Screen Shot 2020-10-28 at 8.57.14 AM.png shows Hunter Biden with his wiener on a piece of pizza.

Many escorts were featured in this data dump and, unlike what was minimally reported on, their faces were visible and uncensored. I ran them all through facial recognition, right away, with mixed results. Indeed, they are mostly escorts but Hallie Biden and other friends, like Ashakai Grant, are also featured with Hunter Biden's wang.

In one of the pictures, Hunter Biden is with his computer where he is logged into PornHub account, RHEast, where he was uploading videos of him and Hallie and others engaged in sexual behavior.

Beau Biden, btw, seemed to be fully aware of this relationship between Hunter and Hallie, where Hunter sent him pictures of acts together. this is why many believe Natalie and or Hunter may be Hunter Biden's biological children.

At this stage, in 2020, the Q movement all but shut down. They had seemed to be waiting for something like this for years, they finally had it all... and the entire Q astroturfing movement completely shut down and Voat deleted itself from the Internet. This was very suspicious. The ""conservative"" news outlets refused to cover what was in the first set of leaks... which was only a portion of the ""hard drive.""

ZeroHedge, Gateway Pundit, Big League Politics... all these outlets I would have expected to jump all over this content... did absolutely nothing. In fact, they even participated in some light disinformation, in some cases.

I posit that the Q movement was a Carlysle Group psyop aided by numerous astroturfing firms like upvotes.club, but also by government contractors like CACI and... QinetiQ.

https://i.imgur.com/YHMJnnP.png

https://steemit.com/politics/@webofslime/mockingbird-x-0

One concerning aspect of the Hunter Biden data that was available in 2020 was that it heavily featured Natalie Biden. Hunter Biden was in possession of hundreds of her personal pictures. It appeared obsessive.

Beyond the pictures, it became clear that many people were concerned about Hunter Biden's ""sexually inappropriate"" interactions where he is naked and smoking crack in front of Natalie Biden.

https://i.imgur.com/XPuBIaj.jpg

What is also concerning, is that, despite being banned from seeing her alone, Hunter Biden is still meeting in secret with Natalie in places like a Whole Foods bathroom. Natalie is on a family outing, then sneaks to the bathroom to meet Hunter Biden... to ""fold clothes.""

By mid 2021, it was clear many people had Hunter Biden data and the ""hard drive"" was repackaged in a variety of ways. With each repacking, data was taken and inserted. I gave up relying on these anonymous dumps and focused on how to verify what was important with the usual OSINT techniques.

Shills will always cry about source, verification and context, so it is important to pre-emptively give it to them to take away their crybaby ammunition.

Now that the issue has gained more steam, you can actually peruse a lot of the emails, yourself.

https://bidenlaptopemails.com/

TMB files has started to gather data... albeit a bit haphazardly:

https://www.tmbfiles.com/search-files/

And the most reliable way to see the new leak is just by downloading the torrent, yourself, and opening in iPhone Backup Extractor.

So, now, here we are again, when every conservative news outlet should be screaming this stuff from the rooftops, but it seems nearly all Hunter Biden posts are getting deleted on all sites, even 4chan, especially Reddit, Twitter is banning people constantly over it... The Q tards are eerily silent.

In short, there is 100% proof of criminality of a variety of types, showing that the Bidens are above the law and will destroy your country for pennies on the dollar.

Hunter Biden will sell out billions of American resources for crack and hookers. He must be stopped. This behavior is ongoing.

Throughout the history other countries have been participating in the game of prisoners dilemma and the goal is to subvert each other all the time. This time it's the US. Other times US subverted others. It's a game we all have to play and those who don't play the game will lose to those who do. Period.

Take a long look at yourselves, your friends, and your family, because you might be a part of the problem. Ask yourself - why is it so easy to subvert us? The answer is quite simple really - lack of common identity. Before that we had a common king, a common religion, a common national identity. Now we don't have kings, religion is being pushed away by science, which, ironically, is a new religion, and you're not allowed to be a nationalist because you're literally Hitler if you do that. People don't have other options other than forming smaller groups which inevitably will fight among themselves. This is what people do. However, the more groups you have throughout the nation, the harder it is to rally people together and the easier it is for others to give funding to those groups to empower them. For fucks sake, ex KGB agents and spies have been openly talking about this very scheme for quite some time. They even emphasize the importance of empowering groups that don't have any truths behind their ideologies and how they'll win. ""Nah, we're different and can't be subverted."" Sure, sure...

I am also not saying they aren't directly or indirectly doing that. What I am saying is that this is a systemic problem and Hillary, Trump, whoever are just actors that don't matter that much. It's a systemic problem created by different actors with the purpose of causing fragmentation of the society. This strategy is much  older than Trump or Hillary and hasn't changed a lot since them.

That same night Jeffery Epstein flew [his private jet to Saudi Arabia](https://www.insider.com/epstein-riyadh-saudi-arabia-private-jet-2019-9), where he reportedly met with soon to be Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The meeting was about [Saudi Vision 2030](https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en), which is Saudi Arabia's version of [UN Agenda 2030](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda). Epstein was very familiar with both of these initiatives as he was a member of the [Trilateral Commission who drafted the original version](https://archive.is/Sqbno) of the initiative known as Agenda 21. It is believed that these initiatives are behind the chaos we are currently living.

Trump spent his early days in office becoming friendly with Saudi Arabia, building strong relationships with its elite and [touching creepy orbs](https://i.imgur.com/1xAOQba.jpg) with them. In June of 2017 Mohammed bin Salman was [appointed Crown Prince](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/06/saudi-crown-prince-mohammed/531075/), and Trump wasted no time in congratulating him. Not everyone in SA was pleased with MBS being named crown prince, most notably prince al-Waleed bin Talal...who owned a soon to be important piece of real estate in Las Vegas.

Fast forward to October 1st 2017, when the infamous Harvest Music Festival Shooting occurred. The official story is lone gunman Stephen Paddock fired into the crowd from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay. You may remember that the story kept changing in the days that followed, and if you build off the police scanner and 911 calls ([which this website does a great job of](https://www.intellihub.com/timeline-of-hell-las-vegas-shooting/)) the story changes to multiple shooters forcing their way up the strip, shooting into multiple hotels. Also worth noting, the floors above where Paddock allegedly shot from are actually part of ""[The Four Seasons](https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-guide/las-vegas-nevada/hotels/four-seasons-at-mandalay-bay)"" a separate hotel [owned by prince al-Waleed bin Talal and Bill Gates](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/13/2) (another big Agenda 2030 player) [This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7b1kzk/the_las_vegas_shooting_and_the_mass_arrests_in/) does a great job breaking down the Saudi involvement theory in detail. If you're looking for a TLDR instead, the theory is that Paddock was an arms dealer and personal pilot for prince al-Waleed bin Talal, who ordered an assassination on MBS who was in Vegas at the time. When the hit team realized they were compromised they killed Paddock and began shooting from his window to create a diversion. They then made there way through the chaos on the streets in an attempt to escape. This is backed up by the infamous video (which youtube kept removing) that showed a man who resembled [MBS being escorted out of the Tropicana](https://i.imgur.com/yQQW02R.png) by an armed security team. This becomes more plausible when you consider that a few weeks later Kushner made an [unannounced visit to Saudi Arabia](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/29/jared-kushner-saudi-arabia-244291) which was followed by [MBS arresting several princes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-waleed-bin-talal.html), including prince al-Waleed bin Talal.

About a year later, the news of Jammal Khashoggi's assassination broke, and fingers were immediately pointed at MBS ([something the media is hammering down toda](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html)y) Jammal Khashoggi isn't the most famous in his family though, as his uncle Adnan Khashoggi was a big time arms dealer. He had many powerful friends, one being Donald Trump, who bought [Adnan's yacht in 1987](https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/editorial-features/trump-princess-inside-donald-trumps-lavish-86m-superyacht--34381). Around that same time Adnan Khashoggi was [involved in the Iran Contra](https://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=530172b9-7e7a-4933-acbc-f864f683863a) scandal with another power and familiar friend...

Fast forward to August 2019, when news broke of Jeffery Epstein's arrest. When the FBI searched his home, they found a safe full of money, diamonds, and a fake passport. The passport had Epstein's picture with a fake name, and had his residence [listed as being in Saudi Arabia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbB49DABQHs). Shortly after Vicky Ward appeared on MSNBC and claimed to have [sources that prove Epstein and Adnan's business together](https://youtu.be/Ip7VmFyGy-s?t=436), and hinted at Epstein's involvement in the Iran Contra scandal.

It is probably worth noting that a month later Jeff Bezos' phone was [hacked by crown prince MBS](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/21/21075990/saudi-arabia-crown-pince-mbs-amazon-jeff-bezos), who allegedly gained access to Bezos' phone through a Whatsapp file.

Then there's Bill Gates, which I could write a post longer than this one is so far about his shadiness. We already connected him to prince al-Waleed bin Talal, but he also has extensive ties to Jeffery Epstein. Gates denied meeting with Epstein, [despite proven records of them meeting several times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnKQ4tzg7ow), including after Epstein's conviction. A lot of [money was secretly transferred](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-jeffrey-epstein-friendship-swedish-mother-daughter-meeting-2019-10) between the 2 of them, and Gate's science advisor [Boris Nikolic was named to be named backup executor of Epstein will](https://www.foxnews.com/us/jeffrey-epstein-will-bill-gates-ex-science-adviser-boris-nikolic-named-executor) 2 days before his death. Little is known about their connection, they both share a common interest in eugenics, and both had a hand in planning UN Agenda 2030. Everything else is left up to the imagination.

So if this is all connected, what was Trumps role in it, and which side was he on? He appeared to be friendly with all of these people in his early days ([pictured here with Adnan Khashoggi and Ghislanes father Robert Maxwell](https://i.imgur.com/W5uLbcY.jpg)) But in more recent years he seemed to distant himself from them. He allegedly [kicked Epstein out of Mar Lago over inappropriate behavior](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/trump-banned-jeffrey-epstein-from-mar-a-lago-for-hitting-on-girl.html), and all of them were arrested when he took office. He also seemed to declare he will not be partaking in Agenda 2030 when he told the UN General Assembly [""the future does not belong to globalists""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wJ8tdxDVgI) Maybe he turned on them, and all of these events were part of a ""battle of the elite"" that had been raging through his time in office.

>Bags of cash delivered to a Rome hotel for favored Italian candidates. Scandalous stories leaked to foreign newspapers to swing an election in Nicaragua. Millions of pamphlets, posters and stickers printed to defeat an incumbent in Serbia.

>The long arm of Vladimir Putin? No, just a small sample of the United States’ history of intervention in foreign elections.

>On Tuesday, American intelligence chiefs warned the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia appears to be preparing to repeat in the 2018 midterm elections the same full-on chicanery it unleashed in 2016: hacking, leaking, social media manipulation and possibly more. Then on Friday, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, announced the indictments of 13 Russians and three companies, run by a businessman with close Kremlin ties, laying out in astonishing detail a three-year scheme to use social media to attack Hillary Clinton, boost Donald Trump and sow discord.

>Most Americans are understandably shocked by what they view as an unprecedented attack on our political system. But intelligence veterans, and scholars who have studied covert operations, have a different, and quite revealing, view.

>“If you ask an intelligence officer, did the Russians break the rules or do something bizarre, the answer is no, not at all,” said Steven L. Hall, who retired in 2015 after 30 years at the C.I.A., where he was the chief of Russian operations. The United States “absolutely” has carried out such election influence operations historically, he said, “and I hope we keep doing it.”

>Loch K. Johnson, the dean of American intelligence scholars, who began his career in the 1970s investigating the C.I.A. as a staff member of the Senate’s Church Committee, says Russia’s 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.

>“We’ve been doing this kind of thing since the C.I.A. was created in 1947,” said Mr. Johnson, now at the University of Georgia. “We’ve used posters, pamphlets, mailers, banners — you name it. We’ve planted false information in foreign newspapers. We’ve used what the British call ‘King George’s cavalry’: suitcases of cash.”

>The United States’ departure from democratic ideals sometimes went much further. The C.I.A. helped overthrow elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s and backed violent coups in several other countries in the 1960s. It plotted assassinations and supported brutal anti-Communist governments in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

>But in recent decades, both Mr. Hall and Mr. Johnson argued, Russian and American interferences in elections have not been morally equivalent. American interventions have generally been aimed at helping non-authoritarian candidates challenge dictators or otherwise promoting democracy. Russia has more often intervened to disrupt democracy or promote authoritarian rule, they said.

>Equating the two, Mr. Hall says, “is like saying cops and bad guys are the same because they both have guns — the motivation matters.”

>This broader history of election meddling has largely been missing from the flood of reporting on the Russian intervention and the investigation of whether the Trump campaign was involved. It is a reminder that the Russian campaign in 2016 was fundamentally old-school espionage, even if it exploited new technologies. And it illuminates the larger currents of history that drove American electoral interventions during the Cold War and motivate Russia’s actions today.

>A Carnegie Mellon scholar, Dov H. Levin, has scoured the historical record for both overt and covert election influence operations. He found 81 by the United States and 36 by the Soviet Union or Russia between 1946 and 2000, though the Russian count is undoubtedly incomplete.

>“I’m not in any way justifying what the Russians did in 2016,” Mr. Levin said. “It was completely wrong of Vladimir Putin to intervene in this way. That said, the methods they used in this election were the digital version of methods used both by the United States and Russia for decades: breaking into party headquarters, recruiting secretaries, placing informants in a party, giving information or disinformation to newspapers.”

>His findings underscore how routine election meddling by the United States — sometimes covert and sometimes quite open — has been.

>The precedent was established in Italy with assistance to non-Communist candidates from the late 1940s to the 1960s. “We had bags of money that we delivered to selected politicians, to defray their expenses,” said F. Mark Wyatt, a former C.I.A. officer, in a 1996 interview.

>Covert propaganda has also been a mainstay. Richard M. Bissell Jr., who ran the agency’s operations in the late 1950s and early 1960s, wrote casually in his autobiography of “exercising control over a newspaper or broadcasting station, or of securing the desired outcome in an election.” A self-congratulatory declassified report on the C.I.A.’s work in Chile’s 1964 election boasts of the “hard work” the agency did supplying “large sums” to its favored candidate and portraying him as a “wise, sincere and high-minded statesman” while painting his leftist opponent as a “calculating schemer.”

>C.I.A. officials told Mr. Johnson in the late 1980s that “insertions” of information into foreign news media, mostly accurate but sometimes false, were running at 70 to 80 a day. In the 1990 election in Nicaragua, the C.I.A. planted stories about corruption in the leftist Sandinista government, Mr. Levin said. The opposition won.

>Over time, more American influence operations have been mounted not secretly by the C.I.A. but openly by the State Department and its affiliates. For the 2000 election in Serbia, the United States funded a successful effort to defeat Slobodan Milosevic, the nationalist leader, providing political consultants and millions of stickers with the opposition’s clenched-fist symbol and “He’s finished” in Serbian, printed on 80 tons of adhesive paper and delivered by a Washington contractor.

>Vince Houghton, who served in the military in the Balkans at the time and worked closely with the intelligence agencies, said he saw American efforts everywhere. “We made it very clear that we had no intention of letting Milosevic stay in power,” said Mr. Houghton, now the historian at the International Spy Museum.

>Similar efforts were undertaken in elections in wartime Iraq and Afghanistan, not always with success. After Hamid Karzai was re-elected president of Afghanistan in 2009, he complained to Robert Gates, then the secretary of defense, about the United States’ blatant attempt to defeat him, which Mr. Gates calls in his memoir “our clumsy and failed putsch.”

>At least once the hand of the United States reached boldly into a Russian election. American fears that Boris Yeltsin would be defeated for re-election as president in 1996 by an old-fashioned Communist led to an overt and covert effort to help him, urged on by President Bill Clinton. It included an American push for a $10 billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia four months before the voting and a team of American political consultants (though some Russians scoffed when they took credit for the Yeltsin win).

>That heavy-handed intervention made some Americans uneasy. Thomas Carothers, a scholar at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, recalls arguing with a State Department official who told him at the time, “Yeltsin is democracy in Russia,” to which Mr. Carothers said he replied, “That’s not what democracy means.”

>But what does democracy mean? Can it include secretly undermining an authoritarian ruler or helping challengers who embrace democratic values? How about financing civic organizations?

>In recent decades, the most visible American presence in foreign politics has been taxpayer-funded groups like the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which do not support candidates but teach basic campaign skills, build democratic institutions and train election monitors.

>Most Americans view such efforts as benign — indeed, charitable. But Mr. Putin sees them as hostile. The National Endowment for Democracy gave a $23,000 grant in 2006 to an organization that employed Aleksei Navalny, who years later became Mr. Putin’s main political nemesis, a fact the government has used to attack both Mr. Navalny and the endowment. In 2016, the endowment gave 108 grants totaling $6.8 million to organizations in Russia for such purposes as “engaging activists” and “fostering civic engagement.” The endowment no longer names Russian recipients, who, under Russian laws cracking down on foreign funding, can face harassment or arrest.

>It is easy to understand why Mr. Putin sees such American cash as a threat to his rule, which tolerates no real opposition. But American veterans of democracy promotion find abhorrent Mr. Putin’s insinuations that their work is equivalent to what the Russian government is accused of doing in the United States today.

>“It’s not just apples and oranges,” said Kenneth Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute. “It’s comparing someone who delivers lifesaving medicine to someone who brings deadly poison.”

>What the C.I.A. may have done in recent years to steer foreign elections is still secret and may not be known for decades. It may be modest by comparison with the agency’s Cold War manipulation. But some old-timers aren’t so sure.

>“I assume they’re doing a lot of the old stuff, because, you know, it never changes,” said William J. Daugherty, who worked for the C.I.A. from 1979 to 1996 and at one time had the job of reviewing covert operations. “The technology may change, but the objectives don’t.”

>Correction: February 18, 2018
>An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that Aleksei Navalny, a political opponent of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, had received grants from the National Endowment for Democracy. In fact, an organization employing him received one $23,000 grant from the endowment in 2006.

It was never about race.  It's about police brutality and an out of control police force that basically is a gang of murderous brutal thugs that can commit crimes with impunity.


We all need to unite against this shit.  The MAGAs, the left, the right, the center, everybody.  Making it about race is so they can divide us.  If it becomes all about BLM or just black people, then they stand a chance for NOTHING TO CHANGE.  So they push that narrative.  Many people buy into it.

Making it about police brutality and rights is something most Americans can get behind.  So they are trying super hard to try and muddle it with racial issues, knowing that will turn off half the population.  Don't be fooled. They're messing with you.

Whether you're right or left, mask or no mask, economy open or closed, pro vaccine or anti vaccine, whichever side it is, there are these growing echo chambers making the dehumanization of the other side so easy and natural feeling. I see the right calling the left sheep, libtards, socialists and anti american. The left is calling the right white supremacists, nazis, and low IQ idiots. Pro mask people are called sheep and people who want freedoms taken away. Anti-maskers are covidiots and grandma killers. All of these broad generalizations of an entire population are so dangerous and it is so scary how fast we've accepted this language. The hypocrisy on both sides is on a level I've never seen before (and that's saying a lot!). Trump supporters gloated and celebrated when Trump beat Hillary, told the left to get over it and he's our president now. Yet it's been nearly two weeks since election day and a week since biden was announced president and they still won't back down. For 4 years the left screamed ""not my president"" but now that Biden has been announced, they are telling the right to stop throwing a tantrum and accept our new president. The right says the left are having violent riots and are destroying cities, but they show up to protest armed like the military ready to shoot (and have) if things escalate. The left calls every right wing get together a super spreader event, but they are out in the streets by the thousands celebrating Biden's win, no social distancing,  barely wearing masks (if at all) and passing around champagne bottles that everyone shares off of. Where is the lack of self awareness of how hypocritical this all is? Why are we ok with treating a whole population of people, 70 million on both sides, with such disrespect and lack of compassion? It seems like no matter how bad it is, as long as it's your team doing it, then it's fine. This is one of the biggest slippery slopes I've ever seen and if we can't start to come together a little more, start calling out our sides for their ridiculous bull shit, and stop dehumanizing each other, then it is going to get easier and easier for people to point a gun at someone they don't agree with. They won't see another human being, they will see a nazi, a sheep, a fascist, a grandma killer. Someone who is less than human and therefore easy to kill. This is how civil war starts.

149,The Simpsons & The Yellow Cube,2125.0,g4m0x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g4m0x9/the_simpsons_the_yellow_cube/,336.0,1587356172.0,"Back in 2006, Dr. Dan Burisch, a microbiologist, came out and claimed he once worked for Majestic 12, an alleged secret organization formed in 1947 by U.S. President Harry S. Truman. Its purpose was to facilitate the recovery and investigation of alien spacecraft. According to Dan, U.S. intelligence agencies were in possession of several devices that were capable of bending space-time, allowing one to look backward or forward in time[.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQqQoGbXsAIhh-f.jpg) They were supposedly a part of a top secret CIA program known as Project Looking Glass. Dan explained how one of the devices was built using instructions found in ancient Sumerian and Egyptian carvings as well as technology recovered from a crashed UFO. The ship was said to come from Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system somewhere in the Orion arm of the Milky Way.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majestic\_12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majestic_12)

The Seti I Temple in Egypt is a very strange place. It has odd carvings Egyptologists can’t explain and some people think there’s actually a portal to another world somewhere inside it. The ancients believed the temple was built on the closest entry point between this world and the next. For this reason it was protected by a cosmic priesthood. They were known to possess knowledge of the cosmos and were here to aid in humanity’s ascension. Dorothy Eady, the caretaker of the temple in the late 1900s, was quite the character. She believed in a past life she had a been a priestess in the temple. The New York Times once called her one of the most intriguing and convincing modern cases of reincarnation. Dorothy also claimed she once fell into a dimensional hole while inside the temple where she could see the past. Were ancient Egyptians also able to see backward and forward in time? Is that what inspired these carvings?

[These are famously known as the helicopter hieroglyphs.](https://preview.redd.it/yt4ra8r60wt41.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f575a5ccc468fdd06912bfe1c678ff3e600a2cd2)

Another carving shows a Pharaoh dragging a weird sled-like vehicle with wings on it. Oddly enough, it kind of looks like the time travel device from the H.G. Wells movie The Time Machine.

[The carving is described as Ramesses running and towing behind him the sacred Henu-boat of the God Sokar.](https://preview.redd.it/3dslf8dm0wt41.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=04a31da5dd5edc7c2deb5c430904df6ad8bfacb8)

According to Dan, this ancient Egyptian knowledge was used by the military to create the devices used in Project Looking Glass. One of them was described as being a small “magic box” you can hold in your hands. They called it the Yellow Cube. He says the Yellow Cube was used by world leaders to see what fate had in store for them. However, they discovered the future wasn’t set in stone. They were shown many different probabilities. They attempted to use this knowledge to manipulate our timeline. They could now see which future would be best for them and what needed to be done to get there. However, they also discovered a future where the whole world was nearly destroyed. They saw that it was caused by Looking Glass technology and immediately shut down the project. But it gets stranger. Matt Groening, the creator of the Simpsons, a show notorious for predicting the future, said the inspiration behind the fictional town of Springfield was a real place in Oregon. Groening grew up there, a couple hours away from a town called Lookingglass.

[https://time.com/4667462/simpsons-predictions-donald-trump-lady-gaga/](https://time.com/4667462/simpsons-predictions-donald-trump-lady-gaga/)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookingglass,\_Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookingglass,_Oregon)

Groening is rumored to be a high ranking Freemason. Perhaps at one point he was involved in Project Looking Glass. Is the Yellow Cube where all the predictions in the Simpsons came from? Are they using television to subconsciously suggest which future we manifest? The Simpsons is arguably the most watched show to ever exist. It’s one of the longest running series in history. To say the least, it’s been able to influence the psyche of your average American every night for the last 30 years. When things are this big you should be suspicious.

[Matt Groening all seeing eye symbolism.](https://preview.redd.it/xh9qwsd52wt41.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0e40134e90bac9bdf15e9e6fda39e84c6b25f99d)

The Simpsons has made countless seemingly impossible predictions. In season 10 episode 2, The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace, Homer accurately predicts the mass of the Higgs Boson 14 years before scientists at CERN discovered it. How is this even possible?

[https://www.sciencealert.com/homer-simpson-predicted-the-mass-of-the-higgs-boson-14-years-before-cern](https://www.sciencealert.com/homer-simpson-predicted-the-mass-of-the-higgs-boson-14-years-before-cern)

The show also seems to be immune to the Mandela Effect. Did the elites do this on purpose? Perhaps they use the show like an interdimensional timestamp. They can tell when they’ve shifted timelines because the television show makes references to things in our original reality. Below is a video showing ten examples of The Simpsons ""wrongly"" remembering history.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEINDb8j1pQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEINDb8j1pQ)

But what I find most strange about all of this is the connection to CERN and the Higgs Boson. If you've read my last thread, you've already read my theory that the world ended in 2012. Like I said earlier, in the year 2012, CERN discovered the Higgs Boson, a particle Stephen Hawking warned could destroy the universe. Perhaps that did happen and we've been living in a parallel universe ever since. This would explain the Mandela Effect. Preston Nichols, another man with ties to Project Looking Glass, claimed that during time travel experiments at Fort Montauk, they were unable to find any tangible future after the year 2012. Remember how Dan said he saw a timeline where Looking Glass technology was responsible for the destruction of the world? What if CERN was secretly a continuation of that technology and they did destroy it? Anyways... Thanks for reading.

[Doesn't Dan kind of look like Homer Simpson?](https://preview.redd.it/6fdc645xdwt41.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9ee5cbb2882d51b2bc1c4ee294bd3bdab89641ba)

The mod team is honored to announce another in our continuing series of AMA (ask me anything) sessions on the subreddit.

For this round, our guest will be NSA Whistleblower William Binnney (verified via /u/WilliamBinney) and the AMA will take place on Thursday, August 27th, at Noon eastern time.

Mr. Binney was kind enough to provide photo verification for this AMA which can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/F1IHym8).

This AMA is of particular interest as Mr. Binney's AMA earlier this week-on another subreddit-[was censored mid way through his scheduled time slot.](https://twitter.com/Burke4Senate/status/1298318463610560512?s=20)

For those unaware;

>William Edward Binney is a former intelligence official with the United States National Security Agency (NSA)[4] and whistleblower. He retired on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency.

>He was a critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and later criticized the NSA's data-collection policies during the Barack Obama administration. 

>Binney was a Russia specialist and worked in the operations side of intelligence, starting as an analyst and ending as a Technical Director prior to becoming a geopolitical world Technical Director. In the 1990s, he co-founded a unit on automating signals intelligence with NSA research chief Dr. John Taggart. Binney's NSA career culminated as Technical Leader for intelligence in 2001. He has expertise in intelligence analysis, traffic analysis, systems analysis, knowledge management, and mathematics (including set theory, number theory, and probability).

>In September 2002, he, along with J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, asked the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting ""millions and millions of dollars"" on Trailblazer, a system intended to analyze mass collection of data carried on communications networks such as the Internet. Binney had been one of the inventors of an alternative system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead. Binney has also been publicly critical of the NSA for spying on U.S. citizens, saying of its expanded surveillance after the September 11, 2001 attacks that ""it's better than anything that the KGB, the Stasi, or the Gestapo and SS ever had"" as well as noting Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to the far less intrusive ThinThread.

As to the issue of the 2016 DNC hack, Mr. Binney has the following to say in the text of [his initial (censored) AMA](https://archive.is/RMhh3);

>Remember when emails released by Wikileaks proved that the DNC rigged the primary election against Bernie Sanders? And everyone claimed that the Russians had hacked the DNC?

>There's only one problem. There was no hack.

>It was an internal leak.

>Here's my proof

>It boils down to these three key points:

>1.) The modification times on the files point to the use of a FAT file system, which is used almost exclusively by storage devices (such as flash drives).

>2.) Analysis of the files released by Guccifer 2.0 -- claimed to be the Russian hacker who got the files to Wikileaks -- reveals that they were created at a data transfer rate consistent with a flash drive, but not with an internet transfer.""

>3.)The NSA would've known the hack was taking place, thanks to the leaks revealed by Edward Snowden, which the NSA has never denied

>In October 2017, at the specific request of President Donald Trump, I met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, at that time CIA Director, and presented my evidence that the ""Russian hack"" never was. Did Trump ever receive that evidence?

>So, Ask me anything!

That extreme left/right division couldn't have happened without a black president being in office before him. Each of the selected puppets serving their purpose in the elites great work. They give you the illusion of choice by selling narratives all day to trick you into voting for who they want and they do it every single time. None of us are fully immune to marketing/propaganda.

 I don't know what we can do to get out of this but fighting with each other over a fake political system is not it. We all have a common enemy and they are playing us like a fiddle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? 


To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.


It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  


Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn't go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn't work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  


You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.


So, if you're King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there's only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that's where President Trump comes in.


You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.



Now comes the bad 


Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don't like losing the power they once had.  What's worse, they don't want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  


October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east


The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here's what happened that night:


** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**

>1.  Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.


>2.  CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here.  You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.


>3.  What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo  They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away. This explains the flight radar reports you see all over the net.  


>4.  Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM


>5.  The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.


>6.  Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they're screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn't so sure.  He doesn't want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.


>7.  The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.


>8.  Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  




Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let's fast forward to one month later.


We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour's death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.


Ok, now that this has happened, what's next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they'll all be executed.   


Do I win the award for the longest post ever at /r/conspiracy?  Thanks for reading.


P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

The total study population included more than 5,500 Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, children, and psychiatric patients, about one-quarter of whom were deliberately infected with syphilis, gonorrhea, or chancroid and all of whom were enrolled in the experiments without their consent. Among the most controversial methods used was “normal exposure,” in which sex workers infected with syphilis were used to transmit the disease to unsuspecting prisoners. Approximately 1,308 soldiers, prisoners, sex workers, and psychiatric patients, ranging from age 10 to 72, were intentionally exposed to STDs during the study. Syphilis exposure occurred through inoculation of the cervix in sex workers; through injection or direct sexual contact with infected sex workers in prisoners; and through injection, inoculation (via abrasion) of the penis, cisternal puncture (the insertion of a needle below the occipital bone at the back of the skull to access cerebrospinal fluid), or oral ingestion in psychiatric patients. Exposure to gonorrhea was carried out in sex workers through cervical inoculation and in Guatemalan soldiers through sexual contact with the sex workers and sometimes through urethral inoculation. https://www.britannica.com/event/Guatemala-syphilis-experiment (http://archive.is/8OmW9)

- Tuskegee syphilis experiment an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the United States government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 622 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 431 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 169[3] did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. The men were told that the study was only going to last six months, but it actually lasted 40 years.[4] After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told that they were being treated for ""bad blood"", a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. ""Bad blood""—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment (http://archive.is/xGIQp)

- On 4 April 1953, the CIA was ordered to undermine the government of Iran over a four-month period, as a precursor to overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh.

**The Government's influence in TV shows and movies:**

- Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think. ""On television, we found more than 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005, from ‘Flight 93’ to ‘Ice Road Truckers’ and ‘Army Wives.' Between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate. These included blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Iron Man, and The Terminator. http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hollywood-cia-washington-dc-films-fbi-24-intervening-close-relationship-a7918191.html (http://archive.is/bbMwx)

-  Over the decades, the relationship between Hollywood and the military has served the needs of both sides: Filmmakers gain access to equipment, locations, personnel and information that lend their productions authenticity, while the armed forces get some measure of control over how they're depicted. That's important not just for recruiting but also for guiding the behavior of current troops and appealing to the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bills. National CineMedia, which sells ads in movie theaters, paired the Army and 20th Century Fox for a marketing campaign designed to reach potential recruits. The campaign intercut footage from the Fox superhero movie ""X-Men: First Class"" with images of real soldiers as a voice-over intoned, ""Heroes — ordinary people who discover they can do extraordinary things."" The spots played in cinemas, and exit polls of 17- to 24-year-olds leaving the movie theater found that those who saw the ad were 25% more likely to say they would consider joining the Army. http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-military-movies-20110821 (http://archive.is/01L57)

- Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

This isn't about concluding that Trump won or Biden won(yet). Considering the fact that the overall results of AZ were less than 20k that means that 54,000 illegal/illegitimate votes is more than enough to decertify the entire State.

And for shills saying "" it doesn't say who the illegal votes are for duurr""

It doesn't matter.

If they can't be verified, they are illegal.

That means the margin to overturn that whole state is too great to have certified in the first place. And that's just one county.

What happens next?

A full state wide FORENSIC (not hand recount which only recounts illegal ballots too) will be called for the entire State.

And now that these results conclusively show that thousands of illegal votes where counted they'll be even more convinced.

That's why reddit activated the shills to be out discrediting and downvoting in full force today.

This is how they divide and conquer. They both have a pile of evidence, testimonies against them, an open history of knowing what Epstein did, yet still hung out with him.
Both of them wanted Epstein dead and was scared of information getting out.

Trump and the Clintons are actual friends. Ivanka Trump and Chelsea Clinton are literally best friends. Trump has donated to the Clintons and invited the Clintons to his own wedding. He was also very upset that he couldn’t go to Chelsea’s wedding and called many people to talk about how “he should be there.” The Clintons have been bought off by Trumps money (and many many many others) and instead of fighting for the working class they used their powers to help make Trump and other billionaires richer and more powerful. They are literally two sides of the same coin.

Clinton has flown on the Lolita express. Trump has flown on the Lolita express. Trump hired Alexander Acosta who was the Florida prosecutor that gave the most sweetheart deal to Epstein and was the reason Epstein walked free. Clinton was seen on Epstein’s island. There was a picture of Clinton in a dress in Epstein’s house. Trump made comments about knowing that Epstein liked underaged girls back in the 80s yet still partied with him.

You can disagree with someone and call them a retard and not get banned. However, people come here to learn about current events and learn about conspiracy theories, and we are being hijacked in this election season (again).

Some kind user in another conspiracy sub showed me the Bot Sentinel plugin. I was surprised to see how rampant bots were, and I realized that a lot of times I was getting angry at bots, then taking it out on real people.

There's a lot of warfare here about left vs right. I would advise people to understand that different things motivate us and we see things differently, but what unites us is our desire for freedom and to fight back against the power of the so-called elite. It is quite sickening that at a time when so many people are waking up to crimes like child trafficking, we are faced with a choice between two old men both accused of being pedos. Epstein is dead (maybe) and Ghislaine is facing trial, but why aren't we hearing daily updates about what the FBI is doing to root out their network, the way we heard Ken Starr talk about cum on a blue dress and secret meetings with the Russians in Trump Tower.

I really feel a change is coming, and I think this community can be a major part of that change. Whatever you think of Coronavirus, it is doing one incredibly good thing...it is blowing the cover clean off the workings of of the elite. Our society has been brainwashed to worship billionaires and we're told that we should trust half of our money with them, but where are they now? They are useless. They only use their money to preserve their positions of power.

But the jig is up. Half the country just isn't going into work and the country is surviving. The ""reality"" we were forced to buy into by the ruling elite, media, politicians, etc is all falling apart. They're even losing control of the stock market. They pumped $1.5 TRILLION into the market, but a surprise happened. A bunch of regular people on RobinHood jumping in and scored some of that cash. Now, the elite are expecting the market to crash again so they can extend their gains, but it isn't happening on their schedule. We know the stock market means nothing about the economy. It is just a rich person's casino, and the RH users flooding the market are fucking up the computer algorithms that companies spend millions to write.

The reason I'm posting this here is that this sub has become a thought leader. We're no longer obscure tin foil hatters, but conspiracies are now mainstream. People will continue to flood this sub, and what is posted here gets echoed around the internet.

As a group, we don't agree on much, and that's fine. But I think it's safe to say that we all agree you can't trust the elite. Any of them. They wouldn't be allowed into the club if they weren't willing to play by the rules.

We are at a point where we can take down the elite parasites. We can destroy the corrupt Hollywood culture that harbors and promotes sexualization of children and just plain decadent excess. We can lead the movement to rid the world of billionaires who make their money through modern day slavery, corrupt government deals, working as fronts for spy agencies, then buy off politicians to make our lives worse so even affording a doctor's visit is a luxury today. We can fight corporations who fund CIA-developed propaganda campaigns in the form of ""marketing"" and mass media.

So, in closing, I just wanted to give a little pep talk to the sub to understand the potential we have here, and hopefully we can take advantage of this opportunity and bring secrecy and corruption to light. Even if we disagree, we are united in our desire to make the world a better place, free from evil, corruption, suppression and slavery.",conspiracy,Trump

His cabinet is filled with ex Goldman Sachs executives, he's beloved by Israeli hardliners, and he used to pal around with Epstein.

>Psychosis is when people lose some contact with reality. Mass formation psychosis is when a large part of a society focuses its attention to a leader(s) or a series of events and their attention focuses on one small point or issue. Followers can be hypnotized and be led anywhere, regardless of data proving otherwise. A key aspect of the phenomena is that the people they identify as the leaders – the one’s that can solve the problem or issue alone – they will follow that leader(s) regardless of any new information or data. Furthermore, anybody who questions the leader’s narrative are attacked and disregarded.

>There are four key components needed for an environment to experience a mass formation psychosis: lack of social bonds or decoupling of societal connections, lack of sense-making (things don’t make sense), free-floating anxiety, and free-floating psychological discontent. Free-floating anxiety is a general sense of uneasiness that is not tied to any particular object or specific situation.

>When followers start to participate in a strategy to deal with the object of anxiety, new social bonds typically emerge and people change from a highly aversive negative mental state and isolation, to the exact opposite to the extremely high-level of connectedness that exists.

You see the fucking problem is when the media, governments, and corporations take a CLEAR SIDE on any political issue and blast that on LOUD SPEAKERS it gives their ignorant followers a PASS to hate. It makes it OKAY to openly bash whoever the media drags in public. That's why people bashed Trump supporters openly for so long, it's why unvaccinated are openly called selfish around the office, it's why after 9/11 people were boldly told to ""go back to YOUR country"" in a fucking line at WAL-MART.

When it comes to the important stuff, and promises that were made by Trump, like exposing the global crime syndicate, investigating and auditing the central banks, restoring our civil liberties taken from us from the NDAA and the patriot act, ending the wars abroad, and dismantling unnecessary and intrusive big government agencies, nothing changed and nothing was even done.

Why would people take to the streets to defend an administration that didn’t do a fucking thing for us? Why are we still holding onto the idea that this administration was any different, and that he is not just another NWO puppet? because of some tacky political theatre that is making you all emotionally invested in the political soap opera and taking things at face value?

Before you read another sentence, think critically about this next statement; imagine a world where you had to pick from 5 legitimate candidates, and they all had to state their policies, show their voting record, release their taxes, and wasn’t supported by a media/lobbyist corrupted plan that allowed them to be evil in broad daylight.     

Divide and conquer is a real strategy. In today’s landscape, we get 1 republican and 1 Democrat who fails to list any of the above, and instead resorts to ad hominem attacks without citing any real policies or plans. And yet, out of 350 million people, were supposed to believe these are the best 2 candidates possible to lead America?

Well here’s the truth. All of these aforementioned institutions, agencies, central banks, media, and governments are in on it together. No, not everyone. The high ranking decision makers. That would be like calling everyone at Amazon evil. 99% of the warehouse workers and software engineers are regular people not privy to the highest level of decision making... the same applies to the CIA, FBI, NSA, Central Bank, Mossad, United Nations, etc. 

These institutions run without federal oversight at the upper levels and contain black budgets that support the  ever ending military industrial complex. They have had a decades long plan to infiltrate the “credible” publications in the media to control a nationwide/global opinion and agenda. 

This is the official United Nations twitter that was tweets less than a day ago: https://twitter.com/un/status/1302593895029714944?s=21 “The #COVID19 pandemic is demonstrating what we all know: millennia of patriarchy have resulted in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture which damages everyone – women, men, girls & boys.”

Make no mistake, this is a global takeover to make a world without borders, for one ruling class to oversee all. Every war besides wars fighting for their perceived liberty (which many of were legit and fought by people who 100% believed in dying for their liberty) have been bullshit. The Iraq war? Bullshit. The Vietnam War? Bullshit. Hell WW1? Bullshit. The War on Drugs and Terrorism? Bullshit. (The CIA black budget makes their profits from drugs, human trafficking, and illegal arms) 

The Kennedy family was the last person to oppose damm never everything I’ve listed, and the result was damn near their entire family being taken out. (At least anyone meaningful in powerful political positions)

ShareBlue is a real organization made to convince you of what to think. Make no mistake there are organizations that spend billions on analyzing data, trends, and telling you what to think. Bots are overrunning social media.

Don’t let someone pigeon hole you into a Republican/Democrat niche thinking. Let us not support what is Republican or Democrat, but what is right. 

Trump may be a politically incorrect imbecile incapable of giving a halfway decent speech, and I think he is an overall bad human being, but I truly believe he detests the powers that are actively working to shape our world to convince everyone we’re all terrible people who are 100% racist. The good news is another 4 years of the propoganda by the media will 100% open the populace eyes to the bullshit narrative they have tried to craft with Comey/Russia/etc. they’re running out of fuel and Coronavirus was their last ditch effort. 

Biden is nothing more than a puppet for the United Nations/ Politicians , status quo, CCP, Trilateral Commission , and more.

The next 4 years will be hell either way. But use this horrible time in our worlds history to demand change, real accountability and leadership, and an expansion of our voting rights /candidates going forward into the future. Sticking to the age old paradigms of conventional Republican and Democrat ways of thinking will year our country, and the last bastion of real freedom apart. This is a monumental time in history, study up on ALL the bullshit the masses have been convinced to believe as conspiracy and you’re already halfway there. 

Don’t trust the media. Don’t trust the “news”. Read REAL history and accounts from real leaders throughout history. Don’t trust elected leaders. Hold them all accountable. Hold agencies accountable. Don’t let them brush institutions and their works under the rug any longer. MK-Ultra is real. Mockingbird is real. These are our OWN institutions that have caused harm to our people.

The release today is even more revealing than the handwritten notes released last night; and specifically President Obama’s “by the book” statement on January 5, 2017, takes on an entirely new light.  They may not realize it yet, but this release implicates Obama.

Within [the release](https://t.co/W1M33J49Tf?amp=1) we discover an “Electronic Communication” or “EC” from the Washington FBI field office recommending to close the FBI investigation of General Flynn on January 4, 2017, due to “no derogatory information.” However, FBI Agent Peter Strzok immediately responds to the FBI team \[main headquarters\] saying: “don’t do it yet’… and the plot unfolds.

There are FBI codenames within the release that need some explanation prior to review:

* **Crossfire Hurricane** (CH) is the overall investigation that began in July 2016
* **Crossfire Typhoon** (CT) is George Papadopoulos.
* **Crossfire Razor** (CR) is Michael Flynn.
* **Cross Wind** is still unknown. \[Could be a person, or a subset of the case\]

Let’s take a walk through the information starting with the FBI electronic communication.

First it is valuable to note three points from the first page:

1. “DOJSCO” – The Special Counsel Office had this information from the outset.  That means everyone in/around the Mueller investigation already knew this information.  That also means that Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein was aware of it.
2. Pay close attention to the dates.  This EC was written on January 4, 2017.  Dates are critical.  When you compare the text messages and emails from Peter Strzok and other participants always refer to the dates to tell the big story.
3. Note the framework for the investigation itself was centered around Michael Flynn violating FARA (Foreign Agent Registration Act) laws based on a fraudulent premise of Flynn working for Russian interests.  The FBI using FARA is a critical point.  FARA was used as the primary justification by the DOJ and FBI for all political surveillance.

The FBI Washington Field Office says they are going to close the investigation of General Flynn because there is **no derogatory information** as a result of multiple investigative inquires:

&#x200B;

The EC document then describes their work with Confidential Human Source (CHS) Stefan Halper.  Interestingly, Halper lied to the FBI and told them he had attended an event with Michael Flynn in Moscow and was a direct eye-witness.  “During the debriefing the CTH relayed an incident s/he witnessed”…. Halper never attended the Moscow event; he lied to the FBI.

The EC notes the FBI is closing this investigation.  However, Peter Strzok goes bananas and immediately starts texting FBI officials to keep the investigation open….

Which leads to a 2:22pm message where Peter Strzok notes “7th floor involved”.  That means FBI Director James Comey is now engaged on the issue.

James Comey being actively engaged is important.  Previously Comey said he was unaware of what they were doing…  Additionally this text and activity is January 4, 2017.

The very next day, January 5th, James Comey goes to the White House for a meeting with President Obama and Vice-President Biden.

January 5th is [the White House meeting](https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2019/11/29/the-mysteriously-redacted-paragraph-700-days-since-lindsey-graham-outlined-susan-rice-cya-memo-and-dc-doesnt-want-answers/) where National Security Advisor Susan Rice, FBI Director James Comey (Crossfire Hurricane), and Deputy AG Sally Yates (Flynn FARA) are talking to President Obama about the status of the Flynn FBI investigation and President Obama says “by the book”.

**SIDEBAR on THIS ISSUE**: This long forgotten [letter](https://www.scribd.com/doc/372258161) from Susan Rice’s lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler (who was also the former White House Counsel to President Obama).  Notice that in Ruemmler’s letter she specifically says the January 5th meeting was about Flynn:

>*\[*[*Feb 23, 2018*](https://www.scribd.com/doc/372258161)*\] The memorandum to file drafted by Ambassador Rice memorialized an important national security discussion between President Obama and the FBI Director and the Deputy Attorney General. President Obama and his national security team were justifiably concerned about potential risks to the Nation’s security from sharing highly classified information about Russia with certain members of the Trump transition team,* ***particularly Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn****.*  
*\[…\] While serving as National Security Advisor, Ambassador Rice was not briefed on the existence of any FBI investigation into allegations of collusion between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia, and she later learned of the fact of this investigation from Director Comey’s subsequent public testimony.*  
*(*[*Reummler Letter*](https://www.scribd.com/document/372258161/Susan-Rice-Response-to-Grassley-Graham)*)*

How could Ms. Susan Rice be aware of a “national security compromise”, “particularly surrounding Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn” after a “briefing by the FBI”, if she was “not briefed on the existence of an FBI investigation”?  With all of this information, these stories are falling apart.

Here's the full text of the Tweet in question:

> @realDonaldTrump: My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!

It seems as though President Trump is quite explicitly and actively targeting Nordstrom because of his family's business engagements with the company. This could end up hurting Nordstrom, which could have a subsequent ""chilling"" effect that would discourage other companies from trifling with Trump family businesses. 

* Is this a conflict of interest? If so, how serious is it?

* Is this self dealing? I.e., is Trump's motive enrichment of himself or his family? Or might he have some other motive for doing this?

* Given that Trump made no pretenses about the purpose for his attack on Nordstrom, what does it say about how he envisions the duties of the President? Is the President concerned with conflict of interest or the perception thereof?

* What will be the consequences, and who might bring them about? Could a backlash from this event come in the form of a lawsuit? New legislation? Or simply discontentment among the electorate?",PoliticalDiscussion,Trump

Potential discussion topics, as we're into heavy political theory territory:

- Impeachment is an inherently political process; when a witness in a court case is subpoena'd for testimony, the court may order their arrest for failing to comply. With impeachment, the consequence for failing to comply with a subpoena is... potential impeachment. What risk does the President run of forcing Congress to impeach him for failing to abide by Congress' exercise of its impeachment power? 
- Does the President instead decide what the impeachment power is? 
- To what extent does political safety guarantee the holder of the executive office a position? 
- To date, no President has been removed from office by the impeachment process - having declared this process illegitimate, could the President make an argument that any resulting impeachment and conviction is illegitimate as well? What would the political ramifications be?",PoliticalDiscussion,Trump

Beginning:

>The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.

>Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton’s chances.

1. Will this have any tangible effect with the electoral college or the next 4 years?

>In an attempt to “lock down” all records of the call, White House lawyers told officials to move an electronic transcript of the call into a separate system reserved for classified information that is especially sensitive, the complaint said.

From the New York Times:

>“China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House to travel to Florida. His request came just moments after he discussed upcoming trade talks with China and said that “if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous power.”

>The president’s call for Chinese intervention means that Mr. Trump and his attorney general have solicited assistance in discrediting the president’s political opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and, according to one report, Britain. In speaking so publicly on Thursday, a defiant Mr. Trump pushed back against critics who have called such requests an abuse of power, essentially arguing that there was nothing wrong with seeking foreign help.

**Potential discussion prompts:** 

- Is it appropriate for a President to publicly request aid from foreign powers to investigate political rivals? Is it instead better left to the agencies to manage the situation to avoid a perception of political bias, or is a perception of political bias immaterial/unimportant?

- The framers of the constitution were particularly concerned with the prospect of foreign interference in American politics. Should this factor into impeachment consideration and the interpretation of 'high crimes and misdemeanors' as understood at the time it was written, or is it an outdated mode of thinking that should be discarded?

>The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump’s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. 

Additionally it's reported that the reason this occured was because Trump was boasting about his access to secretive information.

>In his meeting with Lavrov, Trump seemed to be boasting about his inside knowledge of the looming threat. “I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,” the president said, according to an official with knowledge of the exchange.

>Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States learned only through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence-gathering method, but he described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State’s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.

It was also noted that none of this was the US's to reveal and would likely damage our relationship with the country who shared the information.

Against Sen. McCain
> “I’ve never been there with John McCain because I’ve always felt that he should have done a much better job for the vets,” Trump continued. “He has not done a good job for the vets and I’ve always felt that he should have done a much better job for the vets. So I’ve always had a difficult time with John for that reason, because our vets are not being treated properly. They’re not being treated fairly.”

Against Sen. Ayotte who also denounced the Khan feud.
>“I don’t know Kelly Ayotte. I know she’s given me no support — zero support — and yet I’m leading her in the polls. I’m doing very well in New Hampshire. We need **loyal people** in this country. We need fighters in this country. We don’t need weak people. We have enough of them. We need fighters in this country. But Kelly Ayotte has given me zero support, and I’m doing great in New Hampshire.”

The report also states that the Joint Chiefs chairman and the intelligence director are having their roles on the principals committee restored, reversing the President's decision this past January to downgrade their involvement.


In addition, a senior White House official has told the [Washington Post](http://wapo.st/2nY6u4h$) ""that the change is not a demotion, and that Bannon had accomplished what he set out to do on the National Security Council.""


Does this move signify a greater shift within the Trump administration, or is it not as big of a deal as some media outlets may make it out to be?

Clinics in conservative states have been preparing for possible closure, while facilities in more liberal areas have been getting ready for a potentially heavy influx of patients from other states.

Forerunners of Roe were based on privacy rights such as right to use contraceptives, some states have already imposed restrictions on purchase of contraceptive purchase. The majority said the decision does not erode other privacy rights? Can the conservative majority be believed?

Donald Trump was away at that time but issued a statement saying, among other things: “These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents.” 

Trump also went on to express Monday \[08/08/2022\] that the FBI ""raided"" his Florida home at Mar-a-Lago and even cracked his safe, with a source familiar telling NBC News that the search was tied to classified information Trump allegedly took with him from the White House to his Palm Beach resort in January 2021.

Trump also claimed in a written statement that the search — unprecedented in American history — was politically motivated, though he did not provide specifics.

At Justice Department headquarters, a spokesperson declined to comment to NBC News. An official at the FBI Washington Field Office also declined to comment, and an official at the FBI field office in Miami declined to comment as well. 

If they find the evidence, they are looking for \[allegedly confidential material not previously turned over to the archives and instead taken home to Mar-a- Lago\]. 

There is no way to be certain whether search is also related to the investigation presently being conducted by the January 6, 2022 Committee. Nonetheless, searching of a former president's home is unheard of in the U.S. and a historic event in and of itself.

Republicans have also launched a series of so-far fruitless court battles seeking to overturn the election. President Trump has reportedly called a number of Republican state officials, urging them to use election laws in unprecedented ways to overturn the results. 

The official Arizona GOP Twitter account asked if voters were ready to die for Trump. 

What will be some of the cumulative effects of these measure? Will questioning and trying to reverse election results become the new normal? How will this effect public confidence?

> WASHINGTON — A new trove of emails that appear pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server was discovered after the F.B.I. seized at least one electronic device shared by Anthony D. Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, federal law enforcement officials said Friday.

> The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case — one federal official said they numbered in the tens of thousands — potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election.

In the weeks leading up to an incredibly contentious election, how should federal and state agencies such as the FBI, handle the release of new information that may impact the election?

Should these agencies adhere to their standard operating procedures regardless of their political climate? Should they add nuance to their releases to thwart potential distortion by media reporting? Should these agencies ever delay the release of important information?

This story also raises questions about the politicization of Congressional Committees. Can and should federal agencies push back against what they view to be unduly partisan requests from committees? Or does the importance of Congressional Oversight mean that agencies ought to always fulfill requests for information from Congress promptly?

The FBI is the latest example of government agencies acting and releasing information in the context of the election, but it is not the first. At the [beginning of the month](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/trump-foundation-money.html), the Democratic State Attorney General in New York issued a cease and desist to the Trump Foundation and required that all financial documents be turned over within 15 days.

However, the Trump campaign has consistently pushed back against this picture with the following arguments:

- Biden's lead is a temporary bump buoyed by controversies like COVID19 and BlackLivesMatters, which are a big deal right now but will likely be subdued in the American public consciousness in a few months, as the 24 hour news cycle moves on

- Trump actually has the edge but his supporters are not accurately responding to pollsters, leading to flawed polls

- Three and a half months is still so long that it's impossible to even attempt to determine which way the wind is blowing right now. The way politics works, come October we could see Trump in fact having a double digit lead across all swing states

How should we approach this last argument in particular? Certainly there is time for the narrative to change. Realistically what kind of events would have to happen in order for the map to change 180-degrees and for Trump to lead everywhere again? Could economic recovery do this?

Virtually every lawsuit by Trump-associated lawyers have been struck down hard and fast.

Yet, reading conservative sources, including some here, there is a sizable population that is certain the election was stolen, as does President Trump and others in his administration. Infowars, OANN and a host of conservative websites are beating the drum of election fraud.

I try to keep an open mind, and read the claims. For example, the recent claim that ""suitcases of fake ballots in Georgia were processed after sending poll watchers home."" I read the assertions, then the 'debunking,' and while the video and theory seemed plausible at first, reading the rebuttal --including the one in Forbes-- it looked pretty clear that assertions weren't true, and the responses made more sense than the conspiracy theory. That election officials in Georgia and people in the Republican governor's administration also dismissed the charges as untrue was sufficient for me, especially since they had every reason to want to agree with charges, including considerable pressure from Trump and his supporters. But it's not sufficient proof for those who believe the election was stolen by a vast conspiracy.

I know that the initial response from most about changing these folks' minds is that, ""you can't."" But if 50M people are convinced that the election was stolen, and that our election system is corrupt and unfixable... then they believe that the only way to ""restore"" the system is through martial law and militarily-supervised elections. That's pretty much what Michael Flynn and others are saying. That can't be the only fix. And if we can't convince them otherwise, this is a ticking time bomb for any number of bad things for America.

American politics have been going in this direction for decades, so it isn't surprising we're reaching new all time highs of partisanship. Assuming extreme partisanship is a bad thing, where do you go from here? How do you solve it? 

Are there any historical examples of populations becoming less partisan? One example that came to mind was civil war America. I don't know of any polls, but I would imagine America was pretty partisan if differences came to war. I don't think a civil war is the right solution to solving partisanship though. So this won't work.

Another example might be nationalism. During WW2, FDR's 1942 approval rating [was 82%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating). If you can rally together and fight a common enemy, differences can be temporarily put aside. Nationalism is an emotional control tactic though, and it can't go on forever. And it doesn't look like Democrats aren't vulnerable to nationalism anymore. [22%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/259841/american-pride-hits-new-low-few-proud-political-system.aspx) of Democrats are extremely proud to be American.

Decades ago \[1970\] Chile had elected another leftist president, Salvador Allende.  After a rise in inflation and other economic problems in the country, military officers demanded his resignation. On Sept. 11, 1973, the Chilean Air Force bombed the presidential palace, and the military junta seized power. The coup was led by Augusto Pinochet, who had been appointed commander in chief of the military by Allende, and was backed by the U.S. government as part of Operation Condor. 

Augusto Pinochet coup against President Salvador Allende, was the start of nearly two decades of government repression in Chile. Thousands of people disappeared, tortured and killed. As for Allende, he did not leave the presidential palace alive. Some say, he was killed by the military, others say, he killed himself.

The present race was the most polarizing and acrimonious in recent history, presenting Chileans with starkly different visions on issues including the role of the state in the economy, the rights of historically marginalized groups and public safety. 

Boric will be the nation’s youngest leader \[a former student activist\] and by far its most liberal since President Salvador Allende. Boric will assume office at the final stage of a years long initiative to draft a new Constitution, an effort that is likely to bring about profound legal and political changes on issues including gender equality, Indigenous rights and environmental protections.

Capitalizing on widespread discontent with the political factions \[left and right\] that have traded power in recent decades, Mr. Boric attracted voters by pledging to reduce inequality and promising to raise taxes on the rich to fund a substantial expansion of the social safety net, more generous pensions and a greener economy.

Mr. Boric referred to Kast and assailed several of his plans, which including expanding the prison system and empowering the security forces to more forcefully crack down on Indigenous challenges to land rights in the south of the country. 

Kast, however, was quick to concede"" ""From today he is the elected President of Chile and deserves all our respect and constructive collaboration. Chile is always first.""

Ohio has been trending red over the years, so I think Portman would have had a good shot at winning reelection after winning in a landslide in '16 despite polls showing a close race.

He breaks it down into 5 primary problems:

1. **Geographic sorting**: partly through gerrymandering but much more through our own decisions to live near people with similar political leanings as us, we have created a situation where very few Congressional seats are competitive and Presidential elections are decided by increasingly fewer voters.

2. **Straight-ticket voting**: increasingly less people are voting for candidates in different parties and simply voting straight-ticket.  This makes races even less competitive and leads to most races being little more than a census of party members in an area.  

3. **Primaries have become the new general elections**: because so few seats are competitive, the real races for most seats are in the primaries which have particularly low turnout dominated mostly by the most partisan voters, leading to representatives that are even more partisan.

4. **Congress grinds to a halt**: because of number three, representatives are increasingly unwilling to collaborate and/or compromise for fear of being primaried.  They feel they have to maintain ideological purity in their votes and rhetoric.  This leads to Congress having difficulty accomplishing anything.

5. **Anger at politicians grows**: all of the above leads to anger and disillusionment from the electorate who grow increasingly frustrated with Washington and the political system.  This leads to the rise of candidates who stoke these fears and campaign against these establishment systems like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.

I know many of these concepts aren't exactly new ideas, but I found this piece compelling for two main reasons.  First, as FiveThirtyEight is known for, he cited a lot of data to back up these claims.  Second, I think the organization of these five points in this order is excellent.  Starting at the beginning, each problem leads to the next problem.

* What do you think about these arguments?

* Is this a growing problem that will continue to make things worse?

* Are there other root causes besides increased partisanship and geographic sorting that you can think of?

* How can we address this issue if you think it needs addressed in any way?

* If they aren't addressed, what do you think the next step in symptoms is beyond anger at politicians?

* Is this ultimately a threat to our system of government as we know it?",PoliticalDiscussion,Trump

Additionally, during the elections, Utah was an interesting case study in the viability of third parties, with the practically unknown Evan McMullen putting on an excellent showing in the election, though he failed to gain support of a plurality. After the election, he has repeatedly expressed interest in running for office again, but demured when pressed for details.

Romney encouraged people to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying that getting inoculated is “pro-life.” Being pro-life doesn’t just mean advocating and protecting the unborn. The senator said I also care deeply for the living and don’t want more people to die from COVID19.

Minority Leader Mitch McConnel separately said that he did not realize how difficult it would be to convince people to get the vaccination. Now his campaign is buying radio ads urging Kentuckians to take COVID-19 vaccine. In the 60-second ad, a transcription of which was obtained by The Courier Journal, McConnell references his bout with polio as a child and the decades it took to develop a vaccine for the disease -Contrasting that with the unique opportunity to act fast on COVID-19. 

Senator McConnell also blamed misinformation for the low rates of COVID-19 vaccination among Americans, which are fueling a rise in coronavirus cases, particularly in Republican-dominated states.

Some private sectors are offering incentives or declaring mandates for its employees; Even some universities have joined hands. Auburn university is giving $1,000 scholarships, prime parking and other prizes to fully vaccinated students.

The Biden administration is also imposing restrictions with respect to vaccination requirements for federal employees, \[both civilian and military\].  Thursday President Biden called on state and local governments to use funds from his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan to offer $100 payments to individuals in order to incentivize coronavirus vaccinations. 

Additionally, Biden in his remarks Thursday afternoon announced that the federal government will mandate that its employees get vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to frequent testing. He referred to Kroger's \[a supermarket in some states\] that offered its employees $100 incentive and encouraged other supermarkets to do the same, including giving time off. 

Significant political figures and media outlets, however, largely reject need for vaccination or even mask mandates. Former president Trump has remained silent and many commentator \[though not all\], continue to minimize the dangers of COVID infection and death.

The gist of the story is that Hunter Biden is the ne'er do well son of the president who is alleged to have exploited his connections to his father for personal enrichment and potentially illegally kickbacking some of the money to Joe Biden himself. The reason why it still circulates in conservative circles is because they feel the press hasn't given the story a fair investigatory look like they'd do for any of Donald Trump's adult children.

But what if he wins? 

Trump has changed the Republican platform from regular, Romney-type conservatism to what people have called “Trumpism”. As Wikipedia puts it - Trumpism is the political ideology and style of government of Donald Trump and more generally right-wing conservative-neonationalist or national-populist movements and their rhetoric in Western democracies, such as those under Jair Bolsonaro or Boris Johnson. There has been an ongoing public debate whether or not Trumpism is a form of fascism. 

Key components of Trumpism (Also from Wikipedia) include a dislike for our current allies (NATO, EU, and Canada), pro-Russia, tariffs, nationalism, xenophobia, anti-globalization, anti-media (Fake News), and disinformation (intentional misinformation). Some have also claimed he has shown signs of facism, although that is heavily disputed.

It then suggests that people like Trump are a reaction to this, as they've found that the normal avenues of discussion no longer work. This results in them resorting to the kind of people like Trump, as it will actually get a reaction out of Urban America.

Feinstein's ""move [to release the transcript] follows a decision by Republicans Chuck Grassley, who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Lindsey Graham to issue a criminal referral last week against Christopher Steele, the former British spy who authored the largely unverified 'Trump dossier.'""


In a statement, Sen. Feinstein said that ""[the] innuendo and misinformation circulating about the transcript are part of a deeply troubling effort to undermine the investigation into potential collusion and obstruction of justice. The only way to set the record straight is to make the transcript public.""


CNBC included the following as highlights of the more than 300-page transcript:


>- Steele, Simpson testified, told him the FBI also had a source inside the Trump operation, although he wasn't sure whether that meant the presidential campaign or the Trump Organization. The bureau was more inclined to believe Steele's information, he said, ""because they had other intelligence that indicated the same thing, and one of those pieces of intelligence was a human source from inside the Trump organization."" NBC News' Ken Dilanian later tweeted that the supposed walk-in source ""was a mischaracterization by Simpson of the Australian diplomat tip about Papadopoulis.""


>- Simpson touched on how the Trump Organization handles paying taxes: ""One of the things we found out was that, you know, when it comes to paying taxes, Donald Trump claims to not have much stuff. At least the Trump organization. So they would make filings with various state and local authorities saying that their buildings weren't worth much.""


>- Simpson discussed Trump's relationship with Sater: ""This was something he didn't want to talk about and testified under oath he wouldn't know Felix if he ran into him in the street. That was not true. He knew him well and, in fact, continued to associate with him long after he learned of Felix's organized crime ties. So, you know, that tells you something about somebody.""


>- Fusion GPS Joshua Levy claimed that someone died as a result of the dossier: ""Somebody's already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work.""


>- Fusion GPS did not secure full access to Trump's tax returns, Simpson said: ""They were Trump properties and I believe we may have reviewed some public information about estate taxes and things like that. We didn't have access to his tax returns.""


>- Simpson said he only become aware of the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer when it was reported in the New York Times: ""I was stunned.""


>- Simpson had no ""factual reason to believe"" the Trump Tower meeting was a Russian attempt to make contact with the Trump campaign, but: ""You know, as a sort of question of counterintelligence and just general investigation of Russian methods and that sort of thing, I think that's a reasonable interpretation.""


>- Fusion GPS concluded that Trump ""exaggerated"" his properties' worth in legal filings — but that did not indicate or show connections to Russia: ""Not that I recall.""


>- Simpson said Trump's country clubs aren't making any money: ""They were not profitable entities. I don't specifically recall. I just remember that these were not doing very well and that he'd sunk a lot of money into them and he hadn't gotten a lot of money back yet.""

Her allegations have been reported more on Right Wing websites and brought up on social media by both Sanders and Trump supporters. Some major outlets like the New York Times [did a report](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html) examining the story.  
  
Overall, she claims Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993 by penetrating her genitals with his fingers physically while she was a staffer with his congressional office. She then stated she was forced to leave his office as a result of her complaint not being listened to. Her brother and a friend state she had told them about her assault years before. However, her story has changed as to why she left Biden's office [several times over the years](https://medium.com/@eddiekrassenstein/evidence-casts-doubt-on-tara-reades-sexual-assault-allegations-of-joe-biden-e4cb3ee38460), ranging from a disagreement with another staffer to Biden made her feel uncomfortable.  [Her motivations](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/tara-reade-joe-biden-democrats/) have also come into question, most notably the fact that over the last two years she has made several pro-Putin tweets and comments. The Biden campaign has put out a statement strongly denying her claims.
  
However, things got more serious when a [Larry King live](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/24/new-evidence-tara-reade-joe-biden/) clip from 1993 was revealed, where a woman, who Reade states was her mother, called it saying her daughter was having ""problems"" while working for Senator's office and could not get her complaints addressed. The caller also stated her daughter did not go public out of respect to the Senator. This story now is getting very thorough coverage on [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democratic-leaders-in-congress-remain-mum-on-biden-sexual-assault-allegations-despite-moutning-uproar-from-progressives) and more prominent Right Wing and even more liberal websites. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign and most prominent Democrats have not responded further.  
  
How serious are these claims now, how will they play into the general election? There seemed to be a hope that these claims would just disappear after not getting much media play initially, but the new video may give them more life. And knowing the Trump campaign and how he treated Bill Clinton's assault allegations in 2016, I am sure he will bring this up, as his surrogates are already doing. And how should the Biden campaign and Democrats respond? They are caught in a tough place as previously Democrats were very aligned with the #MeToo movement over the last few years. Should Biden respond to these allegations himself or let his surrogates dismiss them?  
  
Edit: As an update, today [new information came out](https://www.businessinsider.com/former-neighbor-corroborates-joe-bidens-accuser-2020-4) supporting Reade's statements earlier on. Both a former neighbor of Reade's and a colleague confirmed that Reade had told them various details that match her claims in the 90's. Most notably her neighbor, who states she is a Democrat and is even going to vote for Biden, states that Reade described the assault in great detail.

One, they are mostly being outraised by their Democratic counterparts and two, former president Trump has been able to accumulate an enormous fundraising war chest to the tune of over $100 million with barely any of it spent on actual campaigns, either in the primaries or for the general election.

The reason is not that Trump is reserving it for his own use as a potential 2024 presidential candidate. According to campaign laws, his current Save America PAC can only be used for non-presidential campaigns. He'd have to raise a separate PAC for a presidential run and can't transfer any current PAC money into a presidential PAC. So, Trump is essentially sitting on tens of millions of dollars that could go to the struggling candidates he endorsed like senate candidates Oz, Masters, Vance, or Walker or gubernatorial candidates like Mastriano or Lake. An injection of money into their campaigns could make the difference between winning and losing and make them more beholden to Trump than they already are.

What do you make of the reason why Trump has not yet deployed his super PAC to bolster the candidates he backed? Does he not want them to win? Or does he see them as lost causes?

>""I'm running for US Senate because the days of Democrats biding our time, biding our talk, are over,"" said De León, who is the leader of the California Senate. ""Leadership comes from human audacity, not from congressional seniority.""

>He faulted Feinstein for her initial approach to President Donald Trump -- which infuriated Democratic activists here -- mocking her for saying last August that she believed Trump ""can be a good president"" if he had the ability to ""learn and to change.""

>Charging that Feinstein is out of step with the progressive direction of the party, De León pointed to a litany of issues where he said he disagrees with the senior senator, including school vouchers, allowing federal agents to spy on American citizens, and her past support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. De León also chided Feinstein's approach to immigration, charging that he would never use the so-called Dreamers ""as a bargaining chip.""

But, we have played out the era and many republicans did not actually shrink the size of government, just run the federal government poorly.

168,Justin Amash has formed an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian Party's nomination for President. How do you think this would impact the general election?,824.0,ga01sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ga01sm/justin_amash_has_formed_an_exploratory_committee/,551.0,1588123182.0,"Michigan Independent Congressman Justin Amash just announced his exploratory committee on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1255291408732360712).

Amash was one of President Trump's fiercest GOP critics, which led to his leaving the party last year. He's been serving as an Independent ever since, and was notably the only non-Democrat that voted for both articles for impeachment. Before that, Amash was a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, and also chaired the House Liberty caucus, both of which were a thorn in the side of GOP leadership for years.

It goes without saying that he won't win, but I'm more interested in the potential for a shake-up in Michigan. Just a reminder, Trump carried Michigan by a little over than 10000 votes. Amash's district is Republican-friendly (PVI R+6), and he's won every election he's been in by 10 to 20 points. 

* What are his chances of winning the Libertarian Party's nomination?

* Do you think he'll be able to hold onto a significant chunk of his constituents if he doesn't have an R next to his name? Additionally, what voters would he be targeting?

* Could an Amash run and the spoiler-effect swing the election?

* Who benefits: Trump or Joe Biden?

To add some context, Michigan is probably *the* swing state of the 2020 general election. According to the [RealClearPolitics polling average](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/mi/michigan_trump_vs_biden-6761.html), Biden currently holds a 5.5% lead over Trump. The most recent poll is from [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-biden-tops-trump-in-michigan-where-gov-whitmer-is-more-popular-than-president), and has the former VP with an 8-point lead over the President.",PoliticalDiscussion,Trump

Comey spoke candidly in response to the Senate Intelligence Committee's series of questions, stating (among other things) his beliefs that President Trump pressured him to end the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and that Trump eventually fired him for his handling of the overall investigation into the administration's relationship with Russia. He also elaborated on what he considers to be a long-term effort by the Russian government to meddle in the United States' 2016 presidential election which included cyber attacks on perhaps as many as one thousand government agencies and related institutions.

Additionally, the article reports that Woodward's new book *Rage* features accounts on Trump's fitness for office from Jim Mattis and others who have left the Trump administration.

An interesting point to these revelations is that they have all been recorded, with Trump's permission, so the excuse of fake news or unreliable sources is impossible to use this time, like his administration did with his alleged comments on dead soldiers last week. Additionally, Republican senators and officials I've seen asked to comment on this matter, like [Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9E-dGkE-jI), appear to struggle articulating a logical defense for the president, most not attempting to directly grapple with what he said. 

But Trump's core supporters have proven resolute with their support for him. Will this negatively affect support among his base? How might Republican senators and Republican leaning reporters and anchors explain these new developments in a way which does not implicate the president with irresponsibility or deceit in handling this pandemic?

> US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.

> The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump.

Second, the [New York Times is reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/us/politics/mueller-russia-investigation.html?_r=0) that Manafort was told by prosecutors to expect to be indicted:

On the one hand, this may spell trouble for President Trump as it may implicate the highest ranking members of his campaign in nefarious activity.

Recently, Flynn has been charged with the following by Special Counsel Mueller:

>Flynn is accused of falsely claiming that he had not asked Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, last Dec. 29 ""to refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia that same day.""

>Flynn also allegedly lied by telling the FBI ""he did not recall the Russian Ambassador subsequently telling him that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request,"" the information says.

>Flynn is accused of falsely stating that he ""did not ask the Russian Ambassador to delay the vote on or defeat a pending United Nations Security Council resolution,"" according to the filing.

>The charge against Flynn carries a maximum possible prison sentence of five years.

Personally, I feel that the second charge, stating that he did not recall something that in fact did happen, sets an important precedence, as the default ""get away"" answer used by Sessions, Flynn, or usually any lawyer, is ""I don't remember"" or ""I don't recall"". This case makes it so that that is not viable to tell the FBI or judge you don't remember something critical. 

And in regards to the prison sentence, while it may not seem like a lot at first, the charge isn't for colluding with Russia, its for lying to the FBI. And 5 years is longer than a single presidential term, so unless Trump somehow gets a second term as president (unlikely in my opinion but not impossible), putting Flynn in prison for 5 years is the equivalent of permanently taking a chess piece out of the game.",PoliticalDiscussion,Trump

It’s tested us, sown division, and repeated the lives of many people. However, my interest lies in the immense polarization of Dr. Anthony Fauci, a physician who, up until March 2020, was a widely renowned and celebrated figure in the federal government as a *scientist* and *physician* since 1984, when he was appointed director of the NIAID. Of course, the institute helped the United States out of a lot of epidemics, most notably the AIDS epidemic, which got him the Presidential Medal of Freedom from George W. Bush in 2008. 

One important thing to acknowledge is Dr. Fauci is non-partisan. He has served under multiple presidents of both parties. He has never stated his political identity, nor has he induced any sort of political agenda, other than conquering epidemics in America. Of course, some could view this as a political ploy, but for someone who refuses to state their partisan affiliation, it’s highly unlikely. Fauci currently serves as President Biden’s Chief Medical Advisor, an important role in the Presidency and one established in 2019 by President Trump, meaning Fauci is only one of two people to ever hold the position. 

So, why does a man like Dr. Fauci, a strictly non-partisan award winning physician-scientist suddenly become a icon of hate and remorse for people? While they may not agree with his advice, it certainly isn’t backed by any political pundit. It has interested me for a long time and I’m curious to hear what you all have to say about it.

* How can Hillary, in light of the allegations levied against her own husband, capitalize on this news?

* What voting bloc is this news likely to play worst with? Why? What group is least likely to be moved by this story?

But the story also raises questions about the state of American politics and Presidential campaigning.

* Are Presidential candidates under greater scrutiny from the media, their opponents, and the public than they were in the past? If so, do you view this as a favorable or unfavorable development?

* Should a candidate's sexual history, in general, be fair play for the media and opponents, or should candidates be granted some amount of privacy? Does the added element of alleged non-consensuality change the media's responsibility to either report on it or not?

* How might such allegations have played 100 years ago? 50 years ago? 20 years ago? If there's a difference between how influential such allegations might have been over the years, what has given rise to that change? Is it cultural changes, demographic changes, a new journalistic paradigm, or something else entirely?

* Do you believe that such allegations *ought* to play into voting behavior? Do these allegations change, in your view, how effective Trump would be as a President and leader? 

* Should Trump have some presumption of innocence in the public view? Why or why not?

Posted just today by the WSJ (linked below, apologies for the paywall), the Biden campaign will be going after NC, GA, & TX more than any Democratic ticket in recent memory. Additionally, we are seeing Senate races in NC and GA become very competitive for Democrats (also in TX and SC if Democrats have a really, *really* good day). Plus with numerous House seats and state-level Congressional seats all over the South being fiercely targeting by left, are we beginning to see a movement away from Republicanism in the area?

Bolsonaro received 43.2%.

Bolsonaro, who has been heavily criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, ran his platform on promises to increase mining, privatize public companies, and generate more sustainable energy to bring down energy prices. However, environmentalists have also condemned him for his large role in the deforestation of the Amazon.

Lula who was president from 2002 to 2010, vowed to end hunger in the country, which returned during Bolsonaro's administration. He also promised to reduce carbon emissions and deforestation in the Amazon.

The runoff election will allow millions of voters to witness a live debate between the two candidates. Bolsonaro defeated da Silva in the southeast areas, the country's most heavily populated. Over 123 million Brazilians voted in the first round, while 32 million abstained.

“It will be important \[to have a second round\] because we will have the chance to do a face-to-face debate with the current president to know if he will keep on telling lies,” Lula said.

Bolsonaro’s result was eight points higher than the latest Datafolha poll showed on Saturday, while Lula’s was two to three points lower than predicted by polls.

However, watching the results is reminiscent of what Americans endured in 2016.  The difference between what the American pollsters predicted, and the actual outcome and a surprise Trump victory \[sent shockwaves around the world.\]  Some analysts have theorized that the shortcoming in the American polling system was because many Trump supporters were hesitant to declare so openly and hid their real intent.

As an American I have been wondering if the same thing is happening in Brazil, can Lula mobilize a consequential segment of those who sat home during the first round.

If Lula wins but it is only by a few percentage points, will that give grounds to Bolsonaro to reject the election results, much like Trump did the second time around and cause disturbance. Is the likelihood of a close call in the final round cause for concern?",PoliticalDiscussion,Trump

Ultimately, until the new Congress is seated on January 3, the only way for a shutdown to be averted appears to be for Trump to acquiesce, or for at least nine Senate Democrats to agree to fund Trump's border wall proposal (assuming all Republican Senators are in DC and would vote as a block).

As we know, Clinton went on to lose every single one of these states just 3 months after these RCP polls came out. Why?

215,Is the recent revelation that President Trump personally directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress enough for an obstruction of justice case to be made?,733.0,ah72db,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ah72db/is_the_recent_revelation_that_president_trump/,722.0,1547788168.0,"Broken by BuzzFeed News tonight: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation

How does this affect potential charges for obstruction of justice? How does this compare to previous Clinton and Nixon scandals? And, in general, where do you see all of this going next?

Time and time again, we have seen impeachment trials with votes split between parties. It is rare to see politicians crossing party lines to vote against a president of their own party. Even if the president clearly committed a serious offense, politicians of the same party will rarely vote against the president. For example in Donald Trump’s 2nd impeachment trial, 7 senate republicans voted to convict, and 10 house republicans voted to impeach. This is only 17 republicans out of all 261 republicans in congress. However, supreme court justices have no fear of not being re-elected as they serve for life so they are free to make choices based on actual facts. So what do you think? Should congress handle impeachment or should the supreme court?",PoliticalDiscussion,Trump

Trump for Incitement of Insurrection. The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats. 

This is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s administration.

The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from cancer.
Architect of the legal fight for women’s rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation’s highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.

Lawyers for Mr. Trump were expected to appeal the ruling from Judge Victor Marrero of Manhattan federal court. The president’s could not immediately be reached for comment.

In a 75-page ruling, Judge Marrero said called president’s argument ""repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values."" Presidents, their families and businesses are not above the law, the judge ruled.

In response, the President's lawyers filed an emergency notice of appeal to the 2nd circuit. 


## UPDATE:

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has granted Donald Trump a temporary administrative stay pending expedited review by a panel of the Court.

As usual, I would always rather stay and spend my time connecting with you here, however, my campaign manager is telling me it's time to do other things. Please check out my website and social media pages, I look forward to talking with you there!

I am a life-long activist, political organizer, small business owner and mother living in Hallowell, Maine. I am a progressive Democrat running for U.S. Senate, seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Susan Collins. 

Mainers and all Americans deserve leaders who will put people before party and profit. I am not taking a dime of corporate or dark money during this campaign. I will be beholden to you. 

I support a Green New Deal, Medicare for All and eliminating student debt. 

As the granddaughter of a lobsterman, the daughter of a middle school math teacher and a foodservice manager, and a single mom of three, I know the challenges of working-class Mainers firsthand.

I also have more professional experience than any other candidate in this Democratic primary. 

I helped create the first Clean Elections System in the country right here in Maine because I saw the corrupting influence of money in politics and policymaking and decided to do something about it. I ran as a Clean Elections candidate for governor in 2018 -- the only Democratic candidate in the race to do so. I have pledged to refuse all corporate PAC and dirty money in this race, and I fuel my campaign with small-dollar donations and a growing grassroots network of everyday Mainers. 

My nearly 40 years of advocacy accomplishments include:

* Writing and helping pass the first Family Medical Leave Act in the country

* Creating the first Clean Elections system in the country

* Working on every Maine State Budget for 37 years

As of this date, March 3, 2022, Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine, in much the same way as I have predicted here and elsewhere.  The original and unedited form of this post cited to several media appearances and interviews that Vladimir Putin, Sergei Lavrov, Dmitry Peskov and others gave, as well as other examples of disinformation and misinformation from Russian media preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  

I originally submitted on December 8, 2021, before Reddit Admins decided to [censor all Russian domains, in response to Putin's invasion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/t66l5f/reddit_blocked_all_domains_under_russian_cctld_ru/).  Sadly and unsurprisingly, Reddit's decision to censor Russian domains failed to achieve the effect it intended.  This post is one such example.  Here, I focused significantly on identifying and dispelling the disinformation, misinformation and other false narratives of Vladimir Putin's government preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  

While I have had no choice but to remove links to Russian domains, unedited text of my December 8, 2021 post follows:

**********
**********

After the USSR's dissolution, the administrations of [George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/12/04/the-budapest-memorandum-and-u-s-obligations/) undertook considerable diplomatic efforts to prevent the Soviet Union's collapse from increasing nuclear proliferation.  At that time, Ukraine inherited the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world: at least 1,900 strategic nuclear weapons.  Then, the sole threat to Ukraine was the Russian Federation.  Not NATO or the United States. 

### Ukraine's Nuclear Disarmament in Exchange for NATO-member's Assurances of Security

In exchange for Ukraine's agreement to disarm, the United States brokered a deal between Ukraine and Russia known now as the [Budapest Memorandum](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_1994_1399.pdf).  Parties to the Budapest Memorandum were Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation and the United States.  The obligations were for Russia and others to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as the borders were currently drawn.  The teeth were NATO's, even if implicitly.  

Though not a formal defense pact between NATO and Ukraine, the sole reason Ukraine agreed to disarm was based on the United States' and other NATO members' readiness to provide security assurances.  So, if the agreement was ever violated, NATO (and particularly the United States, who brokered the deal) would have to enforce it --- because there was no one else.  Then as now, Ukraine lacked any viable defense against the Russian military --- other than that nuclear arsenal, which it gave up in reliance on the word of the United States.  

But at the time, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin were of the belief that a new era of friendship between the United States and Russia had materialized and would represent the future of US-Russian bilateral relations.  Vladimir Putin has since falsely claimed that a component of those negotiations was something like an implied covenant that NATO would not expand.  George H. W. Bush made no such concessions.  Nor did Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright or anyone else.  

### Why Ukraine Matters

#### Nuclear Proliferation

If Russia invades Ukraine, Iran's nuclear hardliners will be emboldened and Iran may never dismantle its nuclear weapons program.  Consider Libya. Recall that Libya voluntarily dismantled its nuclear program.  

* Gaddafi stated repeatedly that the Administration of George W. Bush, the Blair government, etc. leaned on him to advise Iran and North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons programs too --- which he did, at their behest.  
* Libya further revealed the extent of its WMD program, allowed Russian, American and British officials to visit 10 previously unknown nuclear sites and dozens of Libyan laboratories and military factories to search for evidence of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities and for chemical and missile programs --- which they found. The Islamic world excoriated Gaddafi for doing so.  
* Gaddafi disarmed in exchange for essentially nothing.  Gaddafi, however, believed the George W. Bush Administration was negotiating in good faith --- which they were.  

Gaddafi's mistake wasn't trusting the administration of George W. Bush; it was assuming Bush held the same kind of power he held in Libya.  More specifically, the problem was Hillary Clinton. 

As Obama's Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton failed at every step.  And in what may well prove to be one of the most stunning failures in the history of American foreign policy, Clinton orchestrated the events and circumstances that led to Gaddafi's fall.  Not only did she misread the Arab Spring.  She mislead the Obama administration as a result.  

In so doing, Clinton failed to anticipate the obvious implications to far more compelling foreign policy objectives: Iran and North Korea, the United States' accounts of concern on nuclear proliferation.  Clinton's incompetence essentially destroyed the United States's credibility before its adversaries.  And she had the audacity to proclaim this a success.

Iran obviously took note (and North Korea almost certainly did as well).  Iran saw any nuclear talks with the Obama administration through the lens of what Hillary Clinton did to Gaddafi in Libya in and before 2011, despite Gaddafi's agreement with Bush on Libya's nuclear program.  Yet by some act of providence, Iran nevertheless negotiated with the Obama team and a deal was reached in 2015.  By all counts, the Obama team struck the best deal that could be had then.  It was good while it lasted.  

Iran now sees any nuclear talks with the Biden administration, through the lens of what Donald Trump did to the JCPOA after he was elected and what Clinton did to Gaddafi.  Trump's political blunder was less worse than what happened in Libya.  Two critical blows to American credibility on the world stage on nuclear disarmament.  

Now, what Putin may be preparing to do in Ukraine would be far worse.  What is on the line is not just American credibility with Iran in its dealings during nuclear disarmament talks, but America's credibility as a party to lead those negotiations in the first place.  After all, what possible incentive does Iran have to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program, when it is unwilling to defend a country that detrimentally relied on the United States' prior security assurances?  Of what value is America's present word that it won't invade, should circumstances change in a future administration?  Just exactly how high would the costs be, if Iran defied the United States under Joe Biden's leadership?  

This was not inevitable, but lamentations over what might have been in alternative futures is unproductive.  The question now is how we move forward in view of what is at risk.  

#### Taiwan

If Russia invades Ukraine and the United States fails to provide a credible military response, China will be far more likely to invade Taiwan.  

##### Consider Georgia

The administration of George W. Bush turned a blind eye when Russian forces advanced on Georgian territory in 2008, in violation of Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Putin invaded Georgia was because Mikheil Saakashvili (former Georgian president) was actively pursuing Georgia's induction into NATO.  Georgia joining NATO would have laid a pathway to Ukraine's eventual NATO membership.  To Putin, this was unacceptable.  

At that time, Bush was forced to choose between the long-term and more abstract threat to American interests in the Caucuses and the imminent threat to American interests arising from his engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan.  On the one hand, Georgia did not dismantle a nuclear program in detrimental reliance on American security promises.  On the other, Georgia, like Ukraine, had been engaged in long-standing talks with Washington and other stakeholders for NATO ascension/membership since the end of the Cold War.  Those talks were happening concurrently and their pathway was tied, even if informally.  

Yet, Bush needed access to Russian airspace in order to continue to prosecute the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he would have lost if he questioned Putin's invasion of Georgia.  Iraq and Afghanistan were more important than Georgia to Bush then (which given the options on his plate, was probably the right call in the short-term).  So Putin got away with it.  

##### Consider Crimea and Eastern Ukraine

Putin further exploited the United States's military overextension in and around 2014, by sending ununiformed Spetsnaz troops into and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, following Viktor Yanukovych's (former Ukrainian president, disgraced Russian stool-pigeon) fleeing for Moscow in the wake of Maidan.  

Putin denied essentially every aspect of his operations in and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea until he was confronted with satellite photos of Russian military caravans entering Ukraine with BUK surface-to-air missiles.  But that denial gave Obama the latitude ignore, and then do almost nothing to defend Ukraine or enforce the Budapest Memorandum's covenants in the face of Russian violations.  Which is exactly what happened.  By then, the ""vote"" to ""join Russia"" had already happened in Ukraine, and Putin replicated his siege of Georgia on a larger scale.  Like Bush with Georgia, other problems were in the forefront of Obama's mind, and Obama needed Putin's ongoing cooperation in and over Syria and in dealing with ISIS.  Putin got away with it again. 

Now, China wonders what it might get away with.  It is no coincidence that the Chinese Communist Party's rhetoric has escalated acutely over Taiwan since Biden was elected.  Nor is it a coincidence that China is repeatedly engaging in acts of military aggression in and around Taiwan, its airspace and territorial waters.  These developments are unsurprising, given the nearly complete lack of resistance from Washington and NATO over Ukraine (and Georgia).  In addition, China views this strategic opening in the context of Biden's disgraced withdrawal from Afghanistan.  

In view of Putin's unanswered actions in Ukraine, China recognizes that the Biden administration lacks the will and political capital needed to offer a credible defense of Taiwan.  Note, of course, that the stakes for Ukraine and Taiwan are different, but both are compelling.  For example, in Ukraine, the stakes are nuclear proliferation whereas in Taiwan, the stakes are semiconductor strategic access.  Yet from China's perspective, if the Biden administration is willing to let Russia take Ukraine (even more so than prior administrations already have) or reduce that country to a fragmented and failed state, to prevent it from joining NATO, then there is no will whatsoever in Washington to defend Taiwan.  Especially when that defense would be leveraged against a more powerful force where the United States has profoundly more to lose.

### Invading Ukraine: Actions Vs. Words

Several within the Republican party are arguing that Putin has no intention of invading Ukraine.  Instead, they explain Putin's troop-massing as a defensive measure to protect Russia's borders in response to Ukrainian troop movement inside Ukraine.

* This is consistent with reports from, among others, Russian media who frame Putin's actions as purely defensive, in response to ""Ukraine's creation of threats to the security of Russia.""  
* Putin himself has made the same case, in recent interviews, where he argues that Russia has ""concerns"" relating to Ukrainian military exercises which he characterizes as ""unplanned.""  

Putin's ""response"" is the military equivalent of a neighbor saying ""I saw you lighting candles inside your house without letting me know, so because I am concerned you might light another, I have summoned a fleet of fire trucks and have jumbo jets at the ready to drop fire retardant on everything around you, just in case you should decide to light others.  The idea that Ukraine could or would invade Russia is absurd.  And history counsels otherwise, including in view of what Saakashvili faced from Putin in Georgia during 2008.  

Other events must also be considered for context.  For example, Russian media continue to prime the Russian people with ideas like ""NATO will not stand up for Ukraine"" and the only thing that stands between the Russian Military and Kiev is the unreliable words of Jens Stoltenberg (Alliance Secretary General for NATO) while the White House has done nothing than send Antony Blinken.  After all, Canada has proven a [more robust and reliable ally](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-canada-considers-boosting-military-aid-to-ukraine-as-russia-amasses/) than Washington, under Joe Biden.  Additionally, Sergei Lavrov continues to make the case that Moscow rejects ""transforming"" Ukraine into a NATO military foothold, as reported by Kremlin-backed RT.  In the next breath, Lavrov is making innuendo about Mikheil Saakashvili and Georgia in 2008 --- the last such ""defensive measure"" taken by Putin.  The connection may not be obvious to some audiences, but what [happened in 2008 foretold](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-russia-invaded-georgia-1533682576) the next decade and a half of Putin's military adventurism:

> Long before its conventional assault on Georgia, Russia openly backed separatist militants, launched cyberattacks, and used disinformation to meddle in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Initial intelligence reports of Russian forces entering Georgian territory didn’t even cause enough concern to order Georgian military officials back from their holidays. Though Moscow had long attempted to thwart Georgia’s turn to the West, Russia had not launched a conventional military attack on a neighboring country since it invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
> 
> But in August 2008, under the auspices of “securing” the separatist enclave, Russia invaded [Georgia]. To say the Kremlin uses disproportionate force is an understatement: Russia bombed Georgian positions with more than 200 aircraft, while the Georgian air force had fewer than a dozen combat aircraft in service. Some 80,000 Russian land troops deployed to Georgia; our entire army stood at less than 30,000.
> 
> Yet some in the West, like then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, faulted Georgia. Leaving aside the practical impossibility of Georgia attacking a nuclear power 100 times its size, the entirety of the conflict took place on internationally recognized Georgian territory. The Kremlin’s claim that its land forces mobilized overnight in response to an emergency was absurd. Such an onslaught required careful preparation, especially given the mountainous terrain of the Russian-Georgian border.

The reason Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 was because he recognized there was no will in the West to defend that region from the Russian army.  Putin correctly recognized that Bush was over-extended in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is why he recognized his narrow window of opportunity to act and did so before it closed.  That was very much a ""fortune favors the bold"" type risk that paid off.

### Biden's Most Significant Challenge Yet

#### Iterative Escalation

Putin's strategy here is one of iterative escalation. Based on his actions --- which speak much louder than his words --- Putin hasn't decided whether to invade fully yet or not.  By mounting troops on Putin's border, Putin is trying to gain more information about the risks to his interests that are involved.  

A credible response from the United States alone will keep the Russian army out of Ukraine. Anything less than that, and this will be a repeat of history --- just like with Georgia in 2008.  Whether he will face such a response is what Putin is trying to figure out now.  When I say ""credible response,"" I don't mean just the threat of sanctions.  I mean the threat of an overwhelming military response by the United States and allied powers. If Putin thinks he can take Ukraine without bearing those costs, he will absolutely do so.  

A credible response is not simply economic sanctions or other diplomatic maneuvering like the Obama administration undertook during and after 2014.  Those sanctions had some impact, but they did not change policy.  

#### Strength of Biden's Hand

Biden's hand is weaker than Obama's in 2014, because Obama had more political leverage then.  The United Kingdom will follow Washington but will not act alone.  

Poland will come to the United States' aid but they simply lack the military capability to deliver.  

Germany is not going to cancel Nord Stream 2 or future gas supply contracts with Russia over Russia's having invading Ukraine, and will avoid substantive engagement in the conflict at all costs. Condemnation alone will be the likely limit of Germany's responsive action. Note as well that however harsh Blinken's proposed sanctions may be, their impact will almost certainly be limited by Germany, in view of their their reliance on Russia for energy.  

France will bark (because it does not depend on Moscow for gas in the winter) but not bite, as Russia's actions do not implicate France's direct interests.  Italy will be predictably silent, or side with Russia just as Berlusconi did when Putin seized Georgia in 2008.  

In fact, the only European countries who will stand up for what is proper are those who could be next: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 

Outside of there, Biden will have to depend on Canada and Australia --- each, unlikely bets given their self-inflicted wounds over COVID.  So the only way any attempt at peaceful negotiations can succeed is in the presence of the credible threat of military confrontation as the alternative. Otherwise, politics will be continued by other means.  

### Blood in the Water

The writing is on the wall, and the pattern mirrors what happened in 2008.

* Then, Bush was preoccupied with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia deployed 80,000 Russian land troops to fight an army that stood less than 30,000 in response to imagined provocation and Putin calculated NATO would not defend Georgia.  And he was right, because Bush did nothing even though his hands then were not even remotely as tied as Biden's are now.

* Now, Biden is preoccupied with his catastrophic failure in Afghanistan, COVID and a rising China, Putin has deployed as many troops as comprise nearly the entire (and arguably less competent, less well supplied and less well trained) Ukrainian army and Putin has calculated that Joe Biden will not defend Ukraine.  And he may well be right again for many of the same reasons he was right in 2008.

I don't want war and hope it can be avoided.  But I have every expectation that if Russia invades Ukraine, pieces will be exchanged on the chess board.  Without a credible military response, the United States may well be forced to contend with irreparable harm to its credibility --- both in terms of nuclear negotiations and its interests in Europe and Asia.

It's one thing to oppose so called ""regime change wars"" or other misguided military adventurism, like George W. Bush's war in Iraq.  But it's another matter entirely to live with the consequences of America's withdrawal from global leadership.  It is on that precipice we stand now.",geopolitics,Trump

Russia and Ukraine are building up their forces near the conflict zone. The question is, why? This analysis will try to go into some of the potential end game scenarios and explain why it is happening. The reader should not take this article for anything else than an analysis from a hobby enthusiast.*

**The show of force**

The most likely reason seen is Russia trying to muscle itself in front of Kyiv and Washington. Many experts say the recent Russian military movement does not comprise sufficient force for a conventional Ukraine invasion. With Russia's military posturing, it appears to be primarily coercive and demonstrative in nature as of now.

This argument is backed up by the fact that Russia's Western Military District has, per April 3, not mobilised key regiments and divisions that would likely be necessary to support an offensive against Ukraine. Moreover, Russia has also not built up the required logistical depots — including fuel, ammunition, and medical supplies — for a major offensive. Although there might infrastructure left from the many skirmishes and threats of escalation the last seven years, it is less likely western and Ukrainian intelligence would not have picked it up.

The third point is the lack of stealth and subtlety in the military build-up. If an offensive were the primary goal, the Russian military would not have openly telegraphed ongoing deployments, according to Mason Clark, lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. \*\* On Telegram, Twitter and other Social Media, there are many pictures and videos of the troop deployment that makes it easy to follow the movement.

The timing has also been an argument against an invasion. Right now Ukraine and Russia are at that time of the year called Rasputitsa. The time where travelling on unpaved roads or across the country is difficult and definitely be a disadvantage for an attacking force. 

**The Peacekeepers**

The second reason that might explain Russia's action if preparing for a military campaign is to get Russian ""peacekeepers"" in the Donbas region. Russia has denied and official military forces inside the area, blaming all Russian casualties or prisoners as voluntary soldiers without Moscow's orders. A triggering event, either natural or fake, can provide Russia with the Casus Belli to move into Donbas after an ""invitation"" of the local government in the pretence of protecting Russian citizens.

It would have the merit of preserving existing territorial arrangements, at least outwardly, yet it would allow for the revival of military operations at any moment required by Moscow. Moreover, it is the one military option that fits observable evidence: the movement of forces from Russia and local reserves' mobilisation.\*\*\*

**The (water) invasion**

The least likely option, but not impossible, is a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, of all the analysts found, no one saw this as the main reason for the Russian forces' escalation in the region. Often the Crimea Water crisis is an argument as a reason for war.\*\*\*\*

A forced takeover action of the canal from the Russian military should be considered a last resort, given that the cost of such an operation for Russia would significantly exceed the possible benefit in almost any category.

To try would mean it would be necessary to capture more than 70 km of Ukrainian territory up to the left bank of the Kakhovka reservoir, which would meet strong resistance from a different Ukrainian military that was in 2014 and also entail new sanctions.

Simultaneously, the decommissioned canal has deteriorated in the last seven years, and without a significant overhaul, Russia would lose most of the water during transmission. The canal will also serve as a high-risk target for sabotage from the Ukrainian military, demanding many resources to protect it.

An invasion in this degree would be based on more goals or motivation than just water for Crimea.

*So what is the reason for this escalation?*

**Testing a new President**

When Trump took over the Presidency in 2017, there was a celebration in the Kremlin. However, the party soon ended as both sanctions, and the distance between Washington and Moscow continued. In some ways, the pressure on Russia increased. Trumps administration sent and approved the use of the Javelin missiles for frontline duty. A much welcome weapon to combat Russian tanks for the Ukrainian military, although not a gamechanger. \*\*\*\*\*\*

Biden presidency has early shown its support to Ukraine, and the recent escalation might be to see how far the new administration is willing to go. Putin might hope that Biden is a continuation of the Obama presidency, a man that Putin did not take seriously. However, the Russian President might be disappointed. Biden history in US politics goes back to the 70s, and he has experience both with Putin's Russia and its predecessor, the Soviet Union.

**Stopping a new Zelensky**

Something happened with the Ukrainian President in 2021. First, he stopped three pro-Russian tv channels from the air, and then sanctions hit the country's oligarchs, even the owner of the tv channel that made Zelensky famous, Ihor Kolomoyskyi. These events could be seen as a domestic issue, supported by the US to approve his falling approval ratings. Then the real bombshell hit. On February 19, Viktor Medvedchuk was put on the Ukrainian sanctions list due to the financing of terrorism.

Medvedchuk has been named Putin's man in Ukraine, and the Russian President is also the godfather of Medvedchuks, daughter. A man who has always been in the centre of Ukrainian politics and who always have promoted Russian interest. The sanctions made him powerless in the country. Zelensky could not have made such a move without guarantees from an ally more powerful than national oligarchs and Russia. The fact is that within two months, Ukraine has taken down a pro-Russia propaganda network that took years to build up. It must have been a surprise for both Medvedchuck and the Kremlin to see him being played out on the sidelines so quickly.

**The Nagorno ghost**

The war in Nagorno Karabakh might have ushered us into a new age of warfare, the age of drones. The conflict, where Armenia was supported by Russian arms and Azerbaijan by Turkish, was almost a walkover for the Azerbaijani forces. Turkish drones destroyed Russian bought tanks and armour.

Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones became overnight a weapon in demand, and one of the first buyers was Kyiv, who already have managed to put 6 of them in use. A joint venture between Ankara and Kyiv has also been made Russia's headache, which now must use more resources to research and incorporate drone warfare into its armed forces. The JV is seen as a win-win situation as Ukraine establish a new market and military capabilities, while Turkey might avoid western arms sanctions.§

However, it is to be noted that, like the Javelins, the drone programme is not a game-changer. Still, it puts another weapon in Ukraine's arsenal that again demands more resources to counter. In that sense, it is not surprising to see that the Russian is transporting the S-300 missile or other SAM system near Ukraine. This system might be permanently positioned in Donbas, as evidence suggests that drone use has been a severe problem to the separatists on the front line. In a simple sentence, after seven years, Ukraine has found an area of warfare where Russia lags.

All countries bordering Russia, except China, strategies a war with Russia on the following equation: How much damage can we inflict before Russia sees it as not worth it. The best window for Russia was in 2014.

Although Ukraine is still heavily shorthanded, especially the navy, no one can argue against the progress made. Russia will win if this is one to one conflict, but the costs will most likely be high; many believe it's too high.

BRUSSELS  — President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has promised to move quickly to  rejoin the nuclear deal with Iran so long as Iran also comes back into  compliance. But that vow is easier said than done.

While Mr. Biden’s pledge pleased the deal’s other signatories, who were angry that [President Trump withdrew from it two years ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html), returning to the way things were may be impossible, complicated by both Iranian and American politics.

President  Trump, even as a lame duck, is moving quickly to increase American  sanctions against Iran and sell advanced weapons to its regional  enemies, policies that would be difficult for a new president to  reverse.

Last week, he asked his advisers for [options to launch a military strike](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear.html) against Iran but appears to have been talked out of it. His aides argued that an attack could quickly lead to a larger war.

Iran,  where President Hassan Rouhani faces strong opposition from  conservatives in elections set for June 2021, is expected to demand a  high price to return to the deal, including the immediate lifting of the  punishing sanctions imposed by the Trump administration and billions of  dollars in compensation for them. 

&#x200B;

Those are demands that Mr. Biden is highly unlikely to meet — especially given strong congressional opposition.

Iran’s  deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has tried to pass on to Mr.  Biden’s advisers through intermediaries Tehran’s insistence that the  United States return to the Iran deal unconditionally before any talks  resume, according to Iranian diplomats.

The  diplomats say that Iran is not interested in a temporary freeze and  will not stop enriching uranium or reduce its large stockpile in the  meantime. They said that Iran would return to full compliance with the  deal when the United States does.

Advisers  to Mr. Biden do not confirm receiving any messages from Iran and say  they will only deal with the issue after the inauguration.

Iran  has some leverage. When Mr. Trump took office, Iran had roughly 102  kilograms, or about 225 pounds, of enriched uranium, whose production  was limited by the 2015 agreement. After the United States withdrew,  Iran declared it was no longer bound by the agreement and resumed  enriching uranium at higher levels.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said last week that [Iran now had](https://yhoo.it/35jlGA8)  more than 2,440 kilograms, which is more than eight times the limit set  by the 2015 nuclear deal. The “breakout” time for Iran to possibly make  a nuclear weapon — an ambition it denies — is now considerably shorter  than a year.

During the campaign, Mr.  Biden called Mr. Trump’s decision to abandon the deal “reckless,” and  said it ended up isolating the United States, not Iran.

&#x200B;

“I will offer Tehran a credible path back to diplomacy,” Mr. Biden wrote in a September [op-ed for CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/13/opinions/smarter-way-to-be-tough-on-iran-joe-biden/index.html).  “If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United  States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on  negotiations.”

A week ago, after Mr.  Biden’s victory, Mr. Rouhani welcomed the initiative, calling it “an  opportunity” for the United States “to compensate for its previous  mistakes and return to the path of adherence to international  commitments.”

 The  choice of the word “compensate” was not accidental, said Robert  Einhorn, a nuclear arms-control negotiator now at the Brookings  Institution. Iran says it wants Washington to pay for the billions of  dollars in economic losses it incurred when Mr. Trump pulled the United  States out of the Iran deal in 2018 and reinstituted sanctions that it  had lifted.

Since  then, Mr. Trump has piled on more sanctions. This maximum pressure  campaign, as the administration has called it, devastated Iran’s economy  but failed to push Iran back to the negotiating table or to curtail its  involvement in Iraq, Syria or Lebanon.

The  administration is also trying to further limit Iran’s support for proxy  militias in those countries. It is selling more sophisticated weapons  to the Arab monarchies in the Persian Gulf — countries that see Iran as  an enemy and have their own regional ambitions — and accelerating the  transfer of F-35 fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates.

Some think Mr.  Trump will take more kinetic measures, including further sabotage and  cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear or missile programs or even military  action, which Israel, Egypt and the Gulf allies would most likely  support.

“I don’t think the  administration is finished on the Iran issue,” said Mark Dubowitz, chief  executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a  longstanding supporter of a tough policy on Iran. “I think people are  going to run hard for the next three months against Iran, knowing that  after January there could be a very different Iran policy in place.”

Iranian  negotiators know that the United States would never provide financial  compensation, Mr. Einhorn said. “But they may stake out a tough  negotiating position, especially given the dynamics of their upcoming  election.” He suggested that Iran would demand not just the removal of  the nuclear-related sanctions, but also those imposed for human rights  violations, ballistic missile development and support for terrorist  groups, which a Biden administration would find politically and  technically difficult to do.

 

Short of a quick  re-entry into the nuclear deal, Mr. Einhorn said, the parties should  work toward an interim agreement, in which Iran would roll back a  meaningful part of its current nuclear buildup in exchange for partial  sanctions relief — especially giving Iran access to some of its oil  revenues now blocked in overseas bank accounts. Iran might welcome such  an interim arrangement if it gave the economy a quick boost, especially  before the mid-June elections.

But  given the complications of the American transition of power, with the  requirements for security clearances and Senate confirmation already  slowed by Mr. Trump’s refusal to concede defeat and cooperate with Mr.  Biden, top officials might not be in place very soon. The practical  window between inauguration on Jan. 20 and June is likely to be only two  or three months, which argues for a rapidly constructed “back channel”  between Washington and Tehran after Mr. Biden takes office.

Despite  Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali  Khamenei, has kept the door open to an American return, refusing to  completely abandon the nuclear deal, said Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran  expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Iranians  opposed to the initial deal argue that the United States has proved it  cannot be trusted, and Iran rejected any negotiations with Mr. Trump.  But Ayatollah Khamenei provided Mr. Rouhani “the green light, the  political space to make these messages to a Biden administration” about  Iran’s desire for Washington to return to the deal, Ms. Geranmayeh said.

&#x200B;

At  the same time, she noted, Mr. Rouhani’s hard-line opponents will not  want him “to get this win before the elections in June, and they will  look to jam this effort as the Republicans will try to jam Biden’s,” she  said. Mr. Biden [could quickly lift ](https://ecfr.eu/article/course-correction-in-us-iranian-relations-a-road-map-for-the-biden-administration/)a  number of sanctions tied to Iran’s nuclear activities, including  approving more waivers allowing Iran to sell oil. He could ease travel  restrictions on Iranian citizens, increase humanitarian trade by easing  banking impediments and lift sanctions on some key officials, like  Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, the main nuclear negotiator.

But  sanctions instituted under the category of counterterrorism and human  rights, like those against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, would  be harder to void, especially since many Democrats also support them.  But Ms. Geranmayeh said that Iran would insist that the United States  lift the sanction against the Central Bank of Iran, [accused of financing designated terrorist groups](https://www.state.gov/u-s-sanctions-irans-central-bank-national-development-fund-and-etemad-tejarat-pars/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20has%20sanctioned,financial%20transfers%20for%20military%20purchases.), so that it can once again use the global banking system.

If  the Iran deal can be reconstituted, Iran has said it is open to talks  on other issues, especially regional concerns around Iraq and Syria. But  Iran has so far refused to put on the table its missile program, which  is already under separate American and United Nations sanctions.

 

The key, as with all major policies in  Iran, is Ayatollah Khamenei, now 81. He regards America as a doomed  country in “political, civil and moral decline.” He went along with the  nuclear deal because it promised significant economic benefits from the  lifting of sanctions, and now apparently regards his skepticism about  the United States as confirmed by Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the pact.

But  with the change in American leadership, he again sees the possibility  of easing the economic straitjacket that renewed American sanctions have  imposed.

“Despite Khamenei’s hubris,  a Biden presidency presents both an opportunity and a challenge for  Tehran,” Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment [wrote](https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/11/09/why-biden-can-t-change-u.s.-iran-relations-pub-83185).  “The opportunity is a chance to improve the country’s moribund economy;  the challenge is that Tehran will no longer be able to effectively use  President Donald Trump as a pretext or distraction for its domestic  repression, economic failures and regional aggression.”",geopolitics,Trump

##The nature of lobsters

**Lobsters** are [decapod crustaceans](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/15/2464), 'ten-footed' marine animals, a classification which includes clawed lobsters, spiny lobsters, crabs, shrimps, and crayfish. The precise nature of lobsters, specifically whether they are fish, has been a contested issue in international law for more than one hundred years. There are [30 species](http://www.mesa.edu.au/crustaceans/crustaceans05b.asp) of clawed lobsters, but the most important is the *Homarus americanus* or American lobster, which is found in the Atlantic. More than half of all lobster products are produced in Canada and the United States while the top three lobster-importing countries are Japan, China, and the U.S. There are 45 species of *Panulirus spp.* or spiny lobsters and *Jasus spp.* or [rock lobsters](https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/200/m200p241.pdf), which are found near the coasts of Florida, Brazil, Cuba, and Australia, and are grouped together. Australia and New Zealand are the biggest producers of spiny lobster products. *Homarus gammarus*, the [European lobster](https://www.imr.no/genimpact/filarkiv/2007/07/european_lobster.pdf/en), can be found from the Norwegian Sea to the Aegean Sea. Lobsters are not stationary: they migrate an average of 30 kilometres (19 miles) a year, though some migrate more than [900 miles](https://mlcalliance.org/all-about-lobster/lobster-101-habitat/), making lobster management and ownership difficult and contentious. Lobsters have existed for at least [120 million years](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-lobster/mexico-finds-worlds-oldest-lobster-fossil-idUSN0242811320070503) and live as long as [140](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/4213315/George-the-140-year-old-lobster-to-be-released-by-New-York-restaurant.html) years, showing little cell degradation as they age. They are also capable of [reflex amputation](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/outreach-and-education/fun-facts-about-luscious-lobsters), regrowing lost limbs.

##Why lobsters are so valuable

The [global lobster market](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4775667/lobster-market-global-industry-trends-share?utm_source=BW&utm_medium=PressRelease&utm_code=xs7x4l&utm_campaign=1271187+-+Global+Lobster+Market+Overview+%26+Outlook+2019-2024+-+Leading+Players+are+East+Cost+Seafood%2c+Garbo+Lobster%2c+High+Liner+Foods%2c+Escanaba%2c+and+Thai+Union&utm_exec=joca220prd) is worth €6.7 billion/$5.7 billion USD (2018). Market researchers project the lobster trade will reach €12.51 billion/$13.9 billion USD in value in 2024. The current value of lobsters is based almost solely as seafood, but that may change. There are [more than 200](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/) known applications for lobsters and lobster by-products. Chitin, a biopolymer derived from lobster shells, can be extracted easily and cheaply by grinding up the shells, which traditionally have been trashed. Adding sodium hydroxide to chitin produces [chitosan](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/af57/fa5a2b237174301b9b2740adbbe531a4a527.pdf), a carbohydrate with biomedical applications. The U.S. Army has used more than 400,000 [field bandages](https://www.wired.com/2007/02/shrimp-bandages-save-soldiers/) from shrimp chitosan and now a company has created [lobster-based](https://www.timesrecord.com/articles/front-page/maine-firm-creating-bandages-made-with-lobster-shells/) chitosan bandages. MIT and Harvard University researchers are turning lobster chitin into a flexible, more maneuverable, [body armor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/19/mit-scientists-are-using-lobsters-develop-new-form-flexible-body-armor/). Researchers at [McGill University](https://www.ellsworthamerican.com/maine-news/waterfront/scientists-find-better-way-to-make-use-of-lobster-shells/), the Royal College of Art, and Imperial College London have made lobster chitin into a recyclable, biodegradable [alternative](https://www.businessinsider.com/lobster-shells-plastic-biodegradable-recycle-single-use-waste-2019-5) to single use plastic products like straws and plastic bags. Researchers at the University of Havana have developed [surgical threads](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070713131300.htm) and stitches from lobsters. Lobster chitin can also act as a [surgical implant](https://www.pressherald.com/2018/12/08/researchers-find-new-way-to-convert-lobster-shells-into-durable-plastic/). [Lobster blood](https://bangordailynews.com/2017/01/20/business/lobster-blood-could-be-the-next-best-thing-to-help-treat-warts-shingles/) treats warts and shingles and other skin issues. [Chitin](https://www.joc.com/crabs-lobsters-claw-their-way-uses-medicine-and-food_19880608.html) is a food preservative. It treats itching from burn wounds. It is used in [nutraceuticals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4336979/), nutritional, medicinal products, and [pharmaceuticals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/), medicinal drugs. Chitin acts as chickenfeed and can be made into [dog biscuits](https://archive.bangordailynews.com/2006/03/09/making-it-in-maine-lobster-bisque-its-let-canine-companions-enjoy-seafood/) and compost. It is used in food packaging, bio-stimulant wheat [seed coating](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070713131300.htm), sonar technology, [self-healing car paint](https://newatlas.com/self-healing-car-paint/11254/), [flu decontaminants](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/bm200970x), and [antiviral drugs](https://newatlas.com/chitin-cheaper-antiviral-drugs/21457/).

Humans have eaten lobsters for thousands of years. Lobsters are typically boiled alive to prevent transmission of Vibrio vulnificus, a bacteria found in lots of seafood, which spreads through lobsters within hours of their deaths. Untreated vibrio infections have a [30-50%](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/seafood-lovers-dangers-vibrio-bacteria/story?id=56688448) mortality rate. Lobsters are also difficult to transport for long periods as they tend to get sick and die or resort to cannibalism in confined spaces. Lobsters are a [high protein, low fat](https://www.seafoodworld.net/nutritional-value-of-lobsters/) food and are arguably superior to red meat. As researchers from the University of Adelaide [explain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5487823/), ""The amino acid profile of crustacean protein such as lobster is comparable to that of red meat protein, but it contains more nonprotein nitrogen (amino acids, small peptides, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), trimethylamine, creatine, creatinine, and nucleotides) ranging from 10–40%. Thus, crustacean protein is more palatable than meat proteins.""

##Lobster conflicts

###China, the U.S., and Canada

####U.S. regulations

American lobstermen have been subjected to tremendous economic pressure, first from government regulation, then hurricanes, competition from Canada, and now the U.S.-China trade war. The North Atlantic right whale, a critically endangered species, tends to get tangled in the ropes lobstermen use in their lobster traps. The population has been in a decade-long decline, mostly dying after getting tangled or struck by boats. In [2009](https://bangordailynews.com/2009/11/15/news/lobster-fishermen-shed-floating-rope/), the U.S. government forced lobstermen to switch from floating rope to sinking rope, and 1.6 million pounds of rope had to be discarded and replaced. In 2015, the government limited trap lines and lobstermen switched to stronger lines, which [actually killed more whales](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/protected/whaletrp/trt/meetings/September%202018/tm247__2_.pdf). The federal government is [now](https://www.wsj.com/articles/noaas-plan-to-save-the-whales-has-maine-lobstermen-boiling-11567809249) pressuring the industry to come up with more regulations to address the issue. In 2018 and again in [2019](https://www.mainepublic.org/post/maines-lobster-industry-braces-catastrophic-cuts-bait-fish-catch), the U.S. government imposed stringent herring quotas. Lobstermen, who relied on herring as lobster bait, [switched](https://www.wbur.org/earthwhile/2019/05/28/lobster-bait-herring-shortage-fisheries) to pig hides and other species of fish from outside local areas. American lobstermen are regulated at five levels of government: local, state, federal, international, and by the [Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission](http://www.asmfc.org/about-us/program-overview), an inter-state compact created by the federal government in 1942. Competitors outside the U.S. face less regulation and lax enforcement of existing rules.

####Canadian competition

Canada has [only recently](https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/canada-boosts-protection-of-north-atlantic-right-whales) moved to protect the whales and has far fewer restrictions on lobster fishing. For example, Canadian lobstermen do not have a lobster maximum [size limit](https://www.savingseafood.org/news/washington/sen-susan-collins-questions-lobster-tariffs-and-grey-zone-dispute/) while American lobstermen are [limited](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/species/lobster/guide/index.html) to catching lobster's with a body shell length of five inches. The bigger the lobster shell, the more meat it has and the greater the lobster's value. In [September 2017](https://bangordailynews.com/2019/08/26/news/hancock/its-lost-much-of-its-overseas-business-but-a-lobster-firm-is-starting-up-in-bucksport/), the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement went into affect, eliminating 98% of EU tariffs on Canadian goods. It allowed Canada to export lobsters to the EU, replacing American lobster exports. That same month Florida lobstermen [lost 100,000 lobster traps](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article228822799.html) to Hurricane Irma.

####U.S.-China trade war

The U.S.-China trade war has turned Maine - and Senator Susan Collins - into a target for retaliatory tariffs. Maine lobster exports to China increased by [169%](https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/maine-delegation-urges-aid-for-members-of-lobster-industry-affected-by-trade-war) from 2017 to 2018. In July 2018, the U.S. government placed a 25% tariff on Chinese goods. China retaliated with a 25% tariff on American goods, including live lobsters. On September 1, 2019, China retaliated again, raising the tariff to 35%. U.S. lobster exports to China have [declined by 80%](https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2019/08/26/how-chinas-tariffs-are-affecting-u-s-lobster-exports) while Canadian lobster exports doubled. The U.S. government instituted a 25% tariff on raw steel imported from Canada and Mexico from 2018-2019. The tariff only covered *raw* steel not finished products made from steel, inadvertently making imported [lobster traps](https://www.kvcrnews.org/post/got-lobster-trumps-steel-tariffs-threaten-trap-industry#stream/0) price competitive with American-welded traps. The U.S. Commerce Department is now weighing whether China and Mexico have [dumped](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-imposes-new-tariff-chinese-mexican-steel) steel, which could result in another round of anti-dumping tariffs.

Some of the shift from 'American' to 'Canadian' lobster exports to China is contrived. Lobsters can grow to up to [four](https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2011/0616/How-large-can-lobsters-grow-Big!-But-no-one-knows-how-big) feet long, but lobster eggs are 1/16"". Lobster smuggling is a multi-million dollar enterprise in southeast Asia. Smugglers are now [trafficking American lobsters](https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/supply-trade/us-companies-accused-of-dumping-lobster-in-asia) and [Australian rock lobsters](https://www.scmp.com/article/732369/rock-lobster-row-confirms-hk-asia-smuggling-hub) into China.

####Climate change

Climate change has been great for Maine lobstermen. The Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than 99% of the ocean, resulting in a [515% increase](https://www.gmri.org/news/news-archive/new-study-industry-conservation-ethic-proves-critical-gulf-maine-lobster-fishery) in Maine's lobster population over the last thirty years while other lobster populations elsewhere - like nearby Massachusetts - completely collapsed. However, warming waters also encouraged a growth in the [black sea bass](https://www.mvtimes.com/2019/03/12/black-sea-bass-gobbling-lobsters/) population, which gorge on baby lobsters.

Climate change may make the Maine lobster population [fall as hard](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/1831) over the next thirty years as it rose over the last thirty years as lobsters permanently migrate north, avoiding the uncomfortably hot water in the Gulf of Maine. Our understanding of lobster biology is incomplete. For example, scientists did not know how to precisely determine a lobster's age until 2012, when the University of New Brunswick in Saint John found that [dissecting the eyestalks](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/rings-on-a-lobster-can-tell-its-age-1.1235997) of decapod crustaceans reveals rings that grow once per year. Scientists still debate whether lobsters are capable of feeling pain. We know [American](https://www.boem.gov/espis/5/5659.pdf) and spiny lobsters are magnetoreceptive and that magnetic fields play a role in determining lobster migration (like birds), but we do not know *[why](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Lohmann/publication/299648639_Effect_of_magnetic_pulses_on_Caribbean_spiny_lobsters_Implications_for_magnetoreception/links/5762b58608ae17328926f4ad/Effect-of-magnetic-pulses-on-Caribbean-spiny-lobsters-Implications-for-magnetoreception.pdf?origin=publication_detail)* they are magnetoreceptive or how this influences their movements. Studies have repeatedly found that electromagnetic fields generated by [undersea power cables](https://www.boem.gov/Environmental-Stewardship/Environmental-Studies/Pacific-Region/Studies/2011-09-EMF-Effects.aspx) [influence](https://www.ecori.org/narragansett-bay/2019/9/11/sharks-lobsters-impacted-by-electric-cables-from-offshore-wind) lobster migration.

####Temperature

In the 1920s, studies concluded the ideal temperature for lobster breeding is 15 °C (59 °F) or higher (Huntsman, 1923, 1924). From the 1960s to the 1980s, the scientific consensus placed ideal temperatures at a mean annual sea temperature of 8 to 11 °C (48 to 52 °F) (Dow, 1969: 1062-1063). Today, the scientific consensus is that lobsters cannot handle temperatures above [20°C](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-and/climate-lobsters) (68°F). A [2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783616303150) study found that lobster larvae are negatively affected at 20-24 °C (68-75 °F), but die off at 24-36 °C (75-97 °F), and recommended further examination of the effect of temperature on lobster survival. In 1999, scientists first [identified](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/23/nyregion/deaths-of-lobsters-in-long-island-sound-tied-to-tiny-parasite.html) a parasite, paramoebiasis, which seemed to kill lobsters weakened by high temperatures during a mass die-off. Paramoebiasis passes between infected and healthy lobsters within weeks of cohabitation. There is no guarantee that water temperatures will continue to rise in the Gulf of Maine as we may be at or near the crest of the [Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-and/climate-lobsters). The [American Lobster Settlement Index](https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2019/05/31/from-coast-to-coast-companies-team-up-to-fund-umaine-lobster-research/), first established in 1989, began surveying deep water lobster populations in 2016. ALSI is exploring the theory that lobsters are moving east into deeper (colder) water.

####Mortality

Lobster catches and landings have always fluctuated over multi-year periods with several past scares of unexplained mass die-offs, leading to premature fears of lobster extinction. The average female lobster has 10,000 eggs and females can have up to [100,000](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/faq/faq-archive/fishfaq7.html) eggs, but the survival rate for baby lobsters in the wild is one tenth of one percent. In 2012, Norwegian aquarists [doubled](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/12/121204081144.htm) the survival rate by altering lobster feed in a controlled setting. Experimental aquarists lowered Caribbean spiny lobster mortality in captivity to 3-70% through repeated experimentation, altering lobster feed and sterilizing seawater. The [National Lobster Hatchery](https://www.nationallobsterhatchery.co.uk/) in Cornwall, England has raised and released more than [100,000](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-27499270) healthy lobsters in captivity. This suggests that aquaculture may mitigate the historically high mortality rate in lobster larvae.

####Machias Seal Island

The U.S. and Canada both [claim](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2018/07/22/machias-seal-island-dispute) ownership of Machias Seal Island, a dispute that revolves around a 400-year old legal question. Canada argues that a 1621 land grant made Machias Seal Island part of Nova Scotia and that the 1783 Treaty of Paris exempted Nova Scotian islands from the islands Canada agreed belonged to the United States. The U.S. argues the grant did not make the island part of Nova Scotia and thus the Treaty of Paris recognized American sovereignty over the island. Canada controls the island itself and has had a lighthouse there since 1832. In [1984](https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/67), the International Court of Justice delimited boundaries for the U.S. and Canada, but did not consider the issue of Machias Seal Island. In 2002, Canada legalized lobster fishing in the Grey Zone, the waters around the island where American lobstermen had previously enjoyed exclusive access. Enhanced immigration enforcement in the Trump administration has seen U.S. Border Patrol authorities detain Canadians in the Grey Zone while American lobstermen have begun [arming](https://www.wgbh.org/news/arts/2019/01/29/theres-a-quiet-war-over-lobsters-near-the-canadian-border) themselves, threatening Canadian lobstermen, and there has been mutual lobster trap sabotage. In 2009, disputes between the residents of Matinicus Island, an American island slightly west of Machias Seal Island, and the mainland U.S. also led to [armed confrontations](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32054066/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/police-maine-lobster-turf-war-led-shooting/#.XYPyDCV7l0s), and in 1998, Monhegan Island residents successfully lobbied for exclusive rights to lobstering near their island.

###Miskito, Nicaragua, and Honduras

The Miskito are a pre-Columbian, largely [Moravian](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009182968701500204?legid=spmis%3B15%2F2%2F49&patientinform-links=yes) Protestant people of 300,000. Their native land occupies eastern Honduras and Nicaragua. While Nicaragua and Honduras have a small share of the international lobster market, the lobster industry generates €133 million/$100 million USD (2014) in revenue. They export most of their catch to the United States, particularly the Florida-based restaurant chain [Red Lobster](http://www.ipsnews.net/2004/02/honduras-death-looms-over-miskito-lobster-divers/). The Miskito [overwhelmingly](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1525/cag.1999.21.3.10) make up Nicaragua's lobster divers, but do not own the actual lobster boats, earning only a pittance for their lobster catch. While North American lobstermen trap their lobsters, most Miskito lobstermen dive, a practice that is illegal in most countries because of the danger to divers who decompress too quickly. While North American lobsters are shipped alive, Miskito lobstermen sell frozen lobsters, a far less valuable product. While some American lobstermen [earn six figure salaries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oceans-tide-lobster-specialreport/ocean-shock-lobsters-great-migration-sets-up-boom-and-bust-idUSKCN1N420I), the poverty and desperation of Miskito lobstermen have led them to dive farther out to sea at greater depths and out of season, taking younger, smaller catch, inflicting permanent ecological damage to the lobster population and physical damage to themselves.

####Historical background

The Miskito nation became a British protectorate in 1638, an alliance that endured until 1860, when the British transferred sovereignty of the Miskito kingdom to Nicaragua (through the Treaty of Managua) while maintaining its self-governing autonomy. In 1894, the Nicaraguans annexed the Miskito's territory, violating the Treaty of Managua and triggering a brief British occupation. In the 1970s, the Miskito, Sumo, and Rama nations pressed Nicaragua's Somoza regime for land concessions and legally recognized self-rule, which they had had from 1860 to 1894. Somoza never gave in to their requests. In 1979, the Sandinista revolutionaries (FSLN) took control of Nicaragua and nationalized the seafood industry. Representatives of the three pre-Columbian nations presented Plan 81, defining formal borders for their lands. Instead of land reform and economic assistance, the Sandinistas [burned down and bombed](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/29/movies/on-13-sandinistas-vs-miskitos.html) Miskito villages, forcibly relocating the population they had economically disenfranchized. In 1985, the U.S. cut off all trade with Nicaragua, an embargo that lasted for four years. Nicaragua bypassed the order by presenting [millions of pounds of lobsters](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/19/world/us-gets-taste-of-managua-embargo.html) caught in Nicaragua as 'Honduran lobsters'. Japanese and Honduran lobstermen purchased lobster licenses, working in what Miskito considered their territory without their permission while the government [banned](https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/1206/120652.html) lobster diving, which effectively shut out the Miskito from the industry because Miskito fishermen did not own lobster boats. In 1985, the American Indian Movement, which had been part of the international indigenous rights movement since the 1970s, threatened to [invade](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/11/world/us-indians-enlist-in-the-miskito-cause.html) Nicaragua. In 1988, they were finally granted autonomy (effective in 1990), and in 1990, the lobster ban was lifted.

In 2002 and 2006, the right-wing government of Enrique Bolaños provoked threats of secession from the Miskito (in Nicaragua and Honduras) when he pushed for a transnational dry canal. The canal was never built, but in 2009, the Miskito, partly motivated by [declining lobster profits](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/world/americas/10nicaragua.html), declared independence and have since been in a decade-long low level war with the Nicaraguan government with accusations of violent attacks (including beheadings), land seizures, arson, kidnapping, and rape. In 2013, President Ortega, hated by the Miskito for the original lobster ban, granted a concession to a Hong Kong-based company to build a full, transnational canal through Miskito territory. The Miskito conflict is largely confined to Nicaragua as Honduras now [recognizes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/09/12/honduras-miskito-indians-title-coastal-lands/2807695/) Miskito sovereignty over a territory of 1.86 million acres (920,000 hectares), the land the Miskito had been guaranteed control over in 1860.

####Lobsters and Cocaine

Cocaine traffickers have filled the void left by the Honduran government's withdrawal from Miskito lands. Honduras and Nicaragua do not have the mountains necessary to grow coca, but their location in between cocaine producing countries like Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, and cocaine consuming countries, namely the U.S., has made the ungoverned Miskito space a natural transshipment point for Colombian and Mexican drug cartels since about 2007. Some Miskito lobstermen, unable to make a steady living fishing, have collaborated with traffickers. USAID recognized the lobster-cocaine link and since 2008 has spent [almost a million dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/world/americas/in-remote-honduras-area-drug-raid-stirs-anger.html) to beef up the lobster industry as part of its counter-narcotics strategy. Traffickers travel using planes and boats from Colombia to Bluefields, the capital of Nicaragua's Miskito territory. If traffickers think they have been spotted and risk arrest, they will dump their contraband into the ocean. The cocaine that is dumped and washes ashore is known as '[white lobster](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Nicaraguan-town-rides-high-on-cast-off-cocaine-3168753.php)'. Finding and selling dumped cocaine has become its own profession as the average cocaine package is worth more than €91,000/$100,000 USD in a region with per capita incomes below €5,400/$6,000 USD. Some Miskito nationalists in Nicaragua have [openly suggested](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-13210289) collaborating with drug cartels and accepting that the Miskito economy is now a narco-economy.

###Canada, France, and the UK

The Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 ended the War of Spanish Succession. It also recognized France's right to fish off the northern coast of Newfoundland, fishing rights that had survived the Seven Years War. In the late nineteenth century, Canadian lobstermen moved into French territory, setting up lobster processing factories and violating what the French saw as their exclusive right to fish off the coast. The French lodged official protests, worried about the impact of lobster traps on caplin, which the French used as fishing bait, and cod, which ate lobsters, the potential extinction of the local lobster population, and the seeming disinterest of the British Colonial Office in resolving the issue. The British argued that French fishing rights were concurrent with Canadian fishing rights, that the right to fish did not extend to lobsters because they are crustaceans not fish, and that France needed to negotiate with the Canadians. At the time however, many in England used the word *fish* to mean any animal that lives in the ocean. In 1886, a French warship destroyed a Canadian lobster factory at Port Saunders, and another lobster factory nearby in 1889. The Newfoundlanders responded with the Bait Acts, a series of laws that cut off French access to Canadian bait. The French and British maintained the dispute from 1881 until they reached a compromise, modifying French rights when they signed the Anglo-French Convention in 1904.

###Japan and the U.S.

In 1964, the [Continental Shelf Convention](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXI-4&chapter=21&clang=_en) (CSC), an international treaty, recognized the exclusive right of nations to the territorial waters, sea beds, and natural resources therein that extends [200 nautical miles](https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/continental_shelf_description.htm) from a nation's continental shelf, known as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The CSC includes *[sedentary species](https://www.oceansatlas.org/subtopic/en/c/20/)* in its definition of natural resources exclusively owned by adjacent coastal states. Fish are not included in this definition because they freely pass in and out of an EEZ. Lobsters (and crabs) defy easy categorization because while they are not embedded in sea soil like oysters or clams, they also do not swim through the ocean, they walk on the seafloor. Japanese fishermen had fished for crabs and lobsters in Alaska's continental shelf near the Aleutian Islands, so in 1964, the Japanese argued neither qualified as sedentary species. While the U.S. refrained from formally accepting that either are sedentary species, they compromised, allowing the Japanese to continue fishing in the continental shelf with annual quotas.

###France and Brazil

In the 1960s, France and Brazil had a bloodless military confrontation known as the Lobster War over whether French fishermen had the right to fish for lobsters in Brazil's continental shelf. Mauritania gained its independence from France in 1960. French lobstermen worried they would lose access to Mauritanian fisheries, which had been in a twenty year decline, and began looking elsewhere for lobsters. In 1961, four French ships crossed the Atlantic to Brazil, catching 85,000 lobsters in one month. Brazil initially granted three ships the right to fish off their coast, but dozens of ships followed, so Brazil banned foreign lobster fishing altogether. Fishermen ignored the ban, and in 1962, a massive haul of lobster prompted the Brazilian navy to start boarding French boats. The Brazilian government argued that lobsters traverse the sea floor and therefore were part of the continental shelf, which Brazil exclusively held sway over. France argued lobsters swim like fish and are therefore not part of the continental shelf. The Brazilians [suggested](https://www.vice.com/fr/article/qvg3vp/quand-le-bresil-et-la-france-declenchaient-une-guerre-pour-quelques-langoustes) that if lobsters are fish because they live in water, then kangaroos are birds because they jump in the air.

On January 30, 1963, the Brazilian government boarded and seized three French fishing boats. The French navy sent warships, including a destroyer and an aircraft carrier, to Brazil, and Brazil deployed its navy. France took the issue to the International Court of Justice, but before a decision could be rendered, in 1964, the Brazilian military overthrew President Goulart in a coup d'état. His successor, Castelo Branco, signed a deal accommodating French interests in December 1964, allowing some French lobstermen to fish for five years. In 1966, Brazil took another group of French fishermen when they illegally fished off Fortaleza. In 1969, the Brazilians expanded their designated territorial seas to 12 miles out, and in 1970, they expanded it to 200 miles from their coast.

However, since its early 20th century peak, Argentina’s economy has suffered a series of booms and busts due to its dependence upon the export of agricultural commodities. Since the rise of Juan Peron in the post-war period, these cycles have been exacerbated by populist economic policies. The IMF has been forced to bailout Argentina 21 times, and a detailed history of the ups and downs of Argentina’s economy would require far more space than I have here. Instead, I want to focus on Argentina’s most recent boom and bust cycle. I will discuss the populist policies of Cristina Fernandez, Mauricio Macri’s attempts to clean up the resulting mess, and the economic nightmare faced by the current government of Alberto Fernandez.

**Cristina Fernandez Takes The Populist Road**  
Cristina Fernandez assumed the presidency of Argentina in [2007](http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2012_07.htm), replacing her husband Nestor Kirchner, in a bid for the family to circumvent term limits. Although Nestor Kirchner had railed against the IMF and neoliberalism, and followed a heterodox economic policy, Cristina Fernandez’s 8 years in office marked an [intensification ](http://143.107.92.173/ccpeae/minicursos/2019/Textos%20Minicurso%20Onda%20Rosa%20USP/Damill-2015-Macroeconomic%20Policy%20in%20Argentina.pdf)of populism in Argentina. Between 2007 and 2015, welfare expenditures increased welfare payments 1.7 fold in real terms, and utility subsidies amounted to 5% of GDP. Cristina Fernandez [inherited ](https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/government-budget)a modest budget surplus, but by the end of her presidency the budget deficit was 5% of GDP. Argentina under the Kirchners had taken a hostile stance towards international creditors, and so could on finance the budget deficit by printing money.

The inevitable consequence was high levels of inflation, with inflation reaching 25% by 2015. High inflation rates, combined with a fixed exchange rate led to a heavily overvalued currency putting Argentine manufacturers at a [disadvantage](https://www.courant.com/sdut-winners-and-losers-of-argentine-currency-2015dec17-story.html). The government responded with a system of tariffs and subsidies to keep Argentine manufacturers afloat. The most absurd example of this is the heavy tariffs Argentina on electronics that made most consumer electronics prohibitively [expensive](https://money.cnn.com/2017/04/07/news/economy/argentina-iphone-tariffs-trump/). Some domestic manufacturing thrived, with Blackberry [building ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-economy-manufacturing-analy/end-of-the-world-factories-struggle-to-adapt-to-macris-argentina-idUSKCN1B40BG)a factory in Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America. While there were some winners from this policy of populism, the costs were much higher than the benefits.

The government of Argentina was forced to take increasingly drastic steps to raise revenue. The government [nationalized ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-ypf/argentina-nationalizes-oil-company-ypf-idUSBRE8421GV20120504)the oil industry, and the $30 billion pension industry. The government tried to keep people from knowing how dire the situation by publishing [fake ](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/inflation-lies/)inflation statistics, using the courts to harass the [opposition ](https://www.cjr.org/reports/allout_media_war.php)supporting media, and attempting to quash [corruption ](https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/24/argentina-reject-interference-judicial-independence)investigations by the judiciary. Argentine growth was strong so long as soy and wheat prices were high, but agricultural commodity prices stagnated from 2012 onwards. The populist policies ceased to be sustainable under less favorable conditions, and Argentina saw per capita income increase from 2012 onwards. Ordinary Argentinians, angry with the state of their economy, chose to elect Mauricio Macri to power.

**Mauricio Macri Fails to Get the Job Done**  
Mauricio Macri, a moderate candidate who recognized how toxic the IMF was in Argentina, aimed to stabilize the economy of Argentina by first pursuing [popular ](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/05/lessons-learned-from-the-argentine-economy-under-macri/)economic liberalization to build the political capital necessary for more painful reforms. Investors cheered symbolic steps such as the publishing of [accurate ](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/05/25/argentinas-new-honest-inflation-statistics)inflation statistics. The government cut tariffs, liberalized [capital controls](https://www.ft.com/content/556d51b4-a447-11e5-873f-68411a84f346), and cut [export taxes](https://apnews.com/e7cf20fd438b4a6082226a0a98837f30). The liberalizing policies bore important fruit, including [attracting ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-investment/argentina-expects-14-billion-in-investment-on-fruits-of-reforms-idUSKBN17D2SU)$14 billion in FDI . Moreover, Macri’s crackdown on corruption resulted in dramatic reductions in the cost of building [infrastructure](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/yes-macri-failed-on-the-economy-but-it-wasnt-all-for-naught/). While some unpopular policies were pursued, including [steep reductions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/argentinas-cut-to-electricity-subsidies-will-raise-rates-in-buenos-aires-1453939799) to utility subsidies, the net result was the budget deficit steadily increased to 6.1% of GDP by 2017.

The Macri government’s [ability ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-bonds-bids/argentina-returns-to-global-debt-markets-after-15-years-idUSKCN0XG2W0)to borrow from international capital markets made these large deficits manageable, as the government did not need to print money to keep the lights on. However, long term economic sustainability demanded Macri reduce this deficit and many investors were nervous about the worsening debt situation. One of the key promises Macri made an independent central bank, which tried to impose a strict inflation targeting to keep inflation under control. However Macri wanted greater macroeconomic flexibility, and tried to push the central bank to push for a higher inflation target, undermining the central banks independence. Global financial markets panicked at this misstep, and combined with rising US interest rates and a major drought, caused a [sudden stop](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/6982/1/MPRA_paper_6982.pdf). Investors pulled massive amounts of money out of Argentina [causing ](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03sRB25wdG38KjFi0O9f3xBJTKsLg%3A1608176126274&ei=_tHaX8KlEIOa5gLDwZnAAg&q=usd+to+argentine+peso&oq=usd+to+argentine+peso&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIMCAAQyQMQQxBGEIICMgIIADIECAAQQzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoHCAAQRxCwAzoHCAAQsAMQQzoICAAQsQMQgwE6CwguELEDEMcBEKMCOgkIABBDEEYQggI6DQgAELEDEIMBEBQQhwI6CggAELEDEIMBEEM6BwgAELEDEEM6BQgAELEDOgQIABAKOgUIIRCgAToMCAAQyQMQDRBGEIICOgQIABANOgYIABANEB46CAgAEA0QBRAeUOVRWO1wYIdzaAZwAngAgAFkiAHoDZIBBDIzLjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEMwAEB&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjCnPj1itTtAhUDjVkKHcNgBigQ4dUDCA0&uact=5)the exchange rate to collapse from 20 Argentine Pesos to the Dollar to 40 Pesos to the dollar with little warning.

Argentina found itself in a nightmarish political economy situation. If Mauricio Macri failed to raise taxes and cut spending, the currency would collapse and inflation soar because the budget deficit was too high. The government as a result was forced to implement [austerity ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-economy/argentine-markets-hold-steady-as-anti-macri-protesters-decry-austerity-rising-poverty-idUSKCN1VP1T1)measures. However, these same measures were deeply unpopular, making it more likely left wing populists would come to power, causing financial markets to panic and sink the economy further. The IMF attempted to take an accommodating stance towards Argentina, offering Argentina a [$57](https://www.ft.com/content/5cfe7c34-ca48-11e9-a1f4-3669401ba76f) billion bailout, the largest ever. However, the IMF’s bailout only postponed necessary reforms, associated Macri with the IMF which is hated by many Argentine voters, and failed to quell investor panic. Inflation soared to [over 50%](https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi) and per capita income fell by 5%. Unsurprisingly, in the 2019 general elections, Argentine voters turned against Macri and returned the populist left to power.

In Argentina’s 2019 elections, Alberto Fernandez (no relation to Cristina Fernandez) [narrowly ](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/12/12/how-alberto-fernandez-plans-to-cope-with-argentinas-economic-crisis)won against Mauricio Macri. The Justicialist Party chose to have Alberto Fernandez lead the ticket, as he was a far less polarizing figure than Cristina Fernandez. However, Cristina Fernandez ran as his running mate and it has never been clear where real political authority lay. From the very beginning, Alberto Fernandez’s presidency was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Argentine government reacted with [alacrity ](https://www.wired.com/story/how-argentinas-strict-covid-19-lockdown-saved-lives/)at the beginning of the pandemic, and Argentina was hit much less hard by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic than other countries.

Moreover, the government hasp provided [generous ](https://ww1.issa.int/news/social-security-responses-covid-19-case-argentina)social security supports to help ordinary Argentinians get through the crisis.

Argentina’s current woes are part of a broader pattern of boom and even deeper bust. Argentina finds itself locked into persistent cycles of large government deficits, currency crises and populist government. The current presidency of Alberto Ferndandez is increasingly unpopular, with the current administration’s approval rating falling to [35%](https://en.mercopress.com/2020/10/17/argentine-president-confident-in-the-ruling-coalition-unity-to-face-challenges-despite-signs-of-rifts). It’s likely the next government will inherit the same set of dynamics, and given this next government will have the same set of tools and incentives it is difficult to see how it will perform better. Nevertheless, Argentina will need to find a way to break out of this cycle if it wants to leave economic stagnation behind and see sustained development.

26,"Hezbollah remains extremely popular among Shia Lebanese and has never had more power in the Lebanese government, however they face three imminent crises with no clear solutions.",686.0,f4w6m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/f4w6m0/hezbollah_remains_extremely_popular_among_shia/,33.0,1581883190.0,"Contrary to some media speculation that support for Hezbollah among Lebanese Shia is waning, a new poll conducted by the [Washington institute](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/new-lebanon-poll-despite-protests-most-shiites-still-back-hezbollah-and-ira) indicates that they remain extremely popular among Lebanese Shia. With a approval rating of 90% with that demographic. In addition with the resignation of Saad Hariri and other member of the ""March 14th Alliance"", for the first time in history the government in unanimously strongly supportive of Hezbollah. However Hezbollah is facing new major challenges politically, financially and diplomatically.

**The first and second crises they face is financial and diplomatic.** Hezbollah three main sources of funding are, contributions by Iran, donations from the Lebanese diaspora, and taxes paid by Shia Lebanese. All three of these sources of revenue are under threat.

Last year six countries declared the entirety of Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Three of the six [Argentina](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-49030561), [Germany](https://apnews.com/45c48fdda55ce0d18d2cc03149e08297) and [The United Kingdom](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47359502), have a large Lebanese Diaspora and are important fundraising centers for Hezbollah. The designation of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization makes sending remittances to them illegal in those three countries, cutting off all legal fundraising Hezbollah can do there. As of yet Brazil and France which host the largest Lebanese diaspora in Europe and South America respectively are yet to follow their neighbors lead on this issue. However for Hezbollah its a dangerous trend that's already limiting their ability to fundraise abroad. 

Their second major source of revenue local taxes and contributions is also under threat. Lebanon has among the highest debt to GDP ratio in the world at 160% of GDP. [According to the BBC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-20/yields-past-100-just-put-lebanon-debt-into-venezuela-territory) the large scale protests followed by the resignation of Prime Minster Saad Hariri has caused international investors to lose faith Lebanese bonds. As of November 20th 2019 debt being sold to Lebanon has a average yearly interest rate of 105%. Up from 13% only 5 weeks previously.

This indicates that investors expect Lebanon to default on its debts within a year. And they have good reason to believe so, in order for the new government to avoid a default and ease the economic crisis they need to appease the protesters, the IMF and Lebanon's historic economic backers.

The Gulf States, the US and the Europeans are the obvious sources of economic aid. However all of them are hostile to Hezbollah, so a government consisting entirely of pro Hezbollah politicians will find it extremely difficult to find major donors. In addition the protests, which have spooked international investors and shut down much of the Lebanese economy  are also strongly opposed to the new government. Lebanon is also in dire need of debt restructuring, however the IMF is highly unlikely to back a government that so many of its major donors are hostile to.

As a result Lebanon defaulting on its debt, followed by a currency and credit crisis isn't a questions of if but when. Saad Hariri and his allies understood this, and decided to concede to protesters demands and step down, as a strategy to direct the anger of the protesters at their political rivals. As well as a way to direct the blame for the inevitable economic crisis at the president Michel Aoun and other pro Hezbollah figures. In short Hezbollah and its allies have risen to supremacy in Lebanon at the worst possible time.

Lastly their final major source of revenue is from donations from Iran. However Trump's ""maxim pressure"" campaign has resulted in the Iranian economy shrinking nearly 10% during the past 2 years. With the  [UN predicting](https://financialtribune.com/articles/domestic-economy/101941/un-forecasts-irans-economy-to-shrink-27-in-2020) their economy will shrink a further 2.7% in 2020. While hard numbers in how much Iran contributes to Hezbollah are hard to come by, Iran's ability to finance them will obviously be limited by serious economic problems at home.

In short Lebanon economic crisis will limit their ability to raise funds at home, while Iran's economic crisis threatens funds from their largest donor. All while the growing trend to label their entire organization a terrorist organization limits their ability to fundraise in Europe and South America.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The third Crisis they face is political.** While they have maintained firm support from their Shia base, their approval rating among Christians in Lebanon has rapidly deteriorated. Over the past decade Hezbollah has been trying to reach out and approve their image among Lebanese Christians with some success. Part of their strategy is their alliance with their former civil war enemy ""Michel Aoun"". This unlikely alliance which allowed Aoun to become president. This and other concessions made to Lebanon's christian parties allowed them to increase their approval rating from 18% among Lebanese Christians in 2010 according to  [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2010/02/04/chapter-1-muslim-views-on-extremist-groups-and-conflict/)  to 45% in 2017 according to the [Washington Insitute](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/new-lebanon-poll-despite-protests-most-shiites-still-back-hezbollah-and-ira).

Their popularity among Lebanese Christians reached its peak in 2018, after Hezbollah agreed to back Aoun's push to expand the powers of the presidency. In Lebanon the president legally has to be a Christian, so expand the powers of the presidency is essentially the same thing as expanding Christian influence in Lebanese politics. As a result their approval rating among Lebanese Christians reached a record high of  [83%](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/new-lebanon-poll-despite-protests-most-shiites-still-back-hezbollah-and-ira)  in 2018.

However the 2019 protest movement has resulted in Hezbollah's approval rating among Christians dropping from 83% to only 33% in a single year. Sines Lebanese Sunnis view Hezbollah in a overwhelmingly negative light and Shia view them in a overwhelmingly positive light, Christians are ultimately the king makers in Lebanese elections. The rapid deterioration of Hezbollah's image among Lebanese Christians does not bode well for Hezbollah's christian allies in future elections.

In addition this is before Lebanon's default. If there is one thing that is a constant across all countries, is that economic downturns reduce the popularity of the sitting government. The opposition understands this, and decided to exit stage left before things get really bad.

If you don't know where it is, it is the upside-down ""L"" shape area shaded with ""no data"" on every map.  Most of the world seems to be ignoring this area choosing instead to focus more on the surrounding nations like Mali and Niger, but this war is beginning to become quite consequential and outside players are beginning to get involved. 

I sat down with a panel of experts this week to talk about what is going on in Western Sahara, and what lies ahead for the state. On the panel this week was. 

STEPHEN ZUNES > (Author/Cornell University)  
RICCARDO FABIANI > (International Crisis Group)  
JALEL HARCHAOUI > (Global Initiative)

To vastly oversimplify Western Sahara was once a colony of Imperial Spain, rich in Oil and Phosphates. The countries main people were the semi-nomadic Sahwari tribe who had lived in the area for years under Spanish rule, but with Franco dying the Spanish began to abandon the area as the Oil deposits there weren't very profitable with Libya pumping out so much of it at the time.

Like many African nations the territory was supposed to have a vote on their future, to either become independent or be absorbed into neighboring Morocco or Mauritania. This vote never took place though as tens of thousands of Moroccans accompanied by the Moroccan army marched South into Western Sahara in what became known as ""The Green March"", with Rabat occupying most of the main towns and cities. Rabat was given the rights by Madrid to administer the area until a referendum could be held, but once again that vote never came. 

When it became obvious that Morocco would not ever allow a vote on the issue a 16-year bloody civil war between Morocco and the Polisario Front (being supported with Russian weapons given to them by Algeria) broke out. At the time the US feared the Polisario front was too closely tied with leftist nations, and worried that if they won the war they may support the Soviets, so the US gave funding and weapons to the Moroccan king in the hope he would finish the war. The fighting finally died down in 1991 with Morocco in control of 90% of Western Sahara and the Polisario front owning 10% of the barren desert on the very eastern edge of the country. The Polisario leadership left the country and set up in Tindouf, a small town on the very south-western edge of the Algerian desert. 

This has been the situation for a long time now with much of the African union supporting the Sahwaris, and the French and Gulf States siding with Morocco, but the conflict continued to just simmer away. Recent leadership in Morocco is looking to solve the conflict once and for all now though, and put an end to the war. They are doing this by stepping up construction on a massive highway through Sahwari territory (in the hope of connecting West African states to the Moroccan ports), and beginning bombing and clearing operations in the southern areas controlled by the Sahwaris. 

The major change though is with the international community getting involved more openly than ever before. The Israelis and Turks have begun to supply drones to the Moroccans, the French are supplying intelligence and the US in the final days of the Trump presidency gave full recognition to Morocco's claim over the entire area. 

Morocco has been an important partner for the US and Europe for decades now, both fighting with the US in the ""War on Terror"" and keeping a lid on the refugee situation just 15km to the South of Spain. Washingtons hope in supporting Morocco is that they build this region improving highway down the West coast of Africa, and that the King can remain popular, as there have been genuine fears in Paris that if Morocco were to lose this war the people may turn against the Moroccan royalty and the US/EU would lose one on their most important African partners. 

The Wests support though of Morrocco raises an interesting question, can borders be changed by force? When nations like Saddam's Iraq have moved into other countries they have been met with international push back, but this conflict seems to be flying under the radar. The sources we spoke to all indicated that if a referendum were to be held today Western Sahara would vote almost certainly for independence and become the ""Sahwari Arab Democratic Republic"", which is why Morocco will always refuse to let an official referendum take place. In some terms this action by Rabat seems to be very close to an occupation in all but name, and the current state of affairs has the approval of everyone from Paris to Washington. 

Outside parties would argue that Morocco has bought stability to the region, and overall the West African area will be economically better off under the current situation, but that all comes at the direct expense of the Sahwari people who are currently fighting and dying in big numbers. 

I ask the question though of this group, what is the best option? Should there be a referendum for the Sahwari people to determine their own fate, or is the stability of the Moroccan government and the building of the West African highway more important than that? I would love to get your thoughts and comments on it.

**The US is orchestrating a far-reaching campaign against China.**

[Full video: Vice President Pence's Remarks on US Policy Towards China](https://youtu.be/aeVrMniBjSc?t=736)

Did Cold War II break out last week while no one was watching? As the Kavanaugh confirmation battle raged, many Americans missed what looks like the biggest shift in U.S.-China relations since Henry Kissinger’s 1971 visit to Beijing.

The Trump administration’s China policy swam into view, and it’s a humdinger. Vice President Mike Pence gave a guide to the approach in a speech last week at the Hudson Institute (where I am a fellow). Denouncing what he called China’s “whole of government” approach to its rivalry with the U.S., Mr. Pence vowed the Trump administration will respond in kind. He denounced China’s suppression of the Tibetans and Uighurs, its “Made in China 2025” plan for tech dominance, and its “debt diplomacy” through the Belt and Road initiative. The speech sounded like something Ronald Reagan could have delivered against the Soviet Union: Mr. Xi, tear down this wall! Mr. Pence also detailed an integrated, cross-government strategy to counter what the administration considers Chinese military, economic, political and ideological aggression.

In the same week as the vice president’s speech, Navy plans for greatly intensified patrols in and around Chinese-claimed waters in the South China Sea were leaked to the press. Moreover, the recently-entered trilateral U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement was revealed to have a clause discouraging trade agreements between member countries and China. The administration indicated it would seek similar clauses in other trade agreements. Also last week, Congress approved the Build Act, a $60 billion development-financing program designed to counter China’s Belt and Road strategy in Africa and Asia. Finally, the White House issued a report highlighting the danger that foreign-based supply chains pose to U.S. military capabilities in the event they are cut off during a conflict.
Any one of these steps would have rated banner headlines in normal times; in the Age of Trump, all of them together barely registered. But this is a major shift in American foreign policy. As China responds, and as other countries formulate their approaches to the emerging U.S.-China rivalry, a new international reality will take shape. With many longtime U.S. allies opposed to the Trump administration on trade policy and other matters, and with Russia, North Korea and Iran all looking to frustrate U.S. goals, an indignant China looking for opportunities to make Washington pay may find help.

American businesses engaged directly or indirectly with China could face difficulties as the U.S. strategy is implemented. American presidents have broad authority over trade and investment related to national security. Donald Trump has already used this to threaten and impose tariffs and Mr. Pence warned that even higher tariffs are on the way. The White House report highlighting supply-chain vulnerabilities could provide the basis for new and more far-reaching restrictions.
Business and investors may still be underestimating both the Trump administration’s determination to challenge China and the amount of economic disruption that greater U.S.-China tension can bring. To the mix of longtime China hawks and trade hawks now driving U.S. policy, national security matters more than economic friction, and many of the protestations from the U.S. business community may fall on deaf ears. Both China and the U.S. are likely to move quickly, unpredictably and disruptively as they struggle for advantage; Wall Street should brace itself for further shocks.
In terms of domestic politics, the new and more confrontational policy is likely to be broadly popular. Mr. Trump’s populist base resents the “theft” of American jobs, and human-rights and religious-freedom advocates are increasingly troubled by China’s severe repression at home and support for authoritarian regimes abroad. The foreign-policy establishment may oppose Mr. Trump’s tactics, but it generally accepts the need for a stronger stance against China. Businesses will be split; while some are heavily exposed to a potential deterioration in U.S.-China relations, others are angry about stolen intellectual property, resent restrictions on their access to Chinese markets, or fear competition from subsidized Chinese firms.

Democrats who have relished attacking Mr. Trump for allegedly being soft on Vladimir Putin will have a hard time explaining why a hard line on Russia is a patriotic duty but a tough China policy is a mistake. Things could change if the economic and political costs of confrontation rise, but at least initially the new China policy has encountered little opposition.

Replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement, reshaping the Supreme Court, and launching a new Cold War in the same week is quite the trifecta. America may or may not be on the road to greatness under Mr. Trump, but it is certainly going somewhere, and at an accelerating pace.

I have translated and summarized one of the most popular posts on Zhihu (China's Quora) about Chinese- Indian relations. I feel this is useful information to share as it summarizes and explains the CCP's current view of India (accurate based on my personal links to CCP) and explains why China behaves so antagonistically. This post is **LONG** but is still much shorter than the original. The original has 9 chapters, chapters 5 - 9 focusing on Chinese military strategy in a Sino- Indian war. In the r/india post I have focused on the politics and reasons for conflict described in chapters 1-4. **For** r/geopolitics **I have added a shortened version of chapter 5 describing the importance of Taiwan in Chinese grand strategy.**  I have left out most of the historical background, Chinese idioms and cultural aspects in an effort to shorten the post. **The most important parts are in bold and italicized, I would highly recommend reading those**. Feel free to pm with any questions, Ill try to answer some in the comments. Apologies in advance for mistranslations and/or incorrect information.

**Chapter One, India is big trouble for China in the future**

Today, China faces significant problems on its borders, totally surrounded by strong neighbors. The United States has unprecedented strength and continues to threaten national security. Russia. although it has a small population, has a large geographical advantage . Although Sino-Russian relations are good in the short term, it could be a big variable in the long run. However, an opponent with a great potential threat but easily underestimated is India. India is very weak on the surface, but has a greater potential for development. If you take the long-term view, India is likely to be a significant power in the future.

One reason many people like to laugh at India is that in the 1980s, the economic strength of China and India was evenly matched, but after China’s reform and opening up, China’s economy grew rapidly, and China’s GDP is now five times that of India. This shows how slow India’s economic growth is. However, if you compare it on a global scale, you can actually find that India’s economic growth is not slow. Since 1980, India’s GDP has increased 30 fold. In contrast, the GDP of other developing countries except China and India has only increased 10 fold, and the GDP of developed countries has even increased 8 fold. To a certain extent, it is not that India’s economic development is slow, but that China’s economic growth is too fast. ***China’s economic achievements conceal India’s economic miracle. If there is no comparison with China, then India’s economic growth can be considered a global miracle.***

On the other hand, China’s rapid economic growth has not come without a price. Due to strict family planning rules, China today faces the problem of aging and declining birthrate at the same time. India has not implemented such a strict family planning policy, and the proportion of young people is very high. Although this has dragged down economic growth, India’s demographic dividend advantage has become increasingly prominent in the past ten years. We know that young people are the main creators of social wealth, and the number of young people has a great influence on the economic strength of China. To some extent, if the number of young people in India is twice that of China in 2050, even if India’s per capita output is only half of China by then, India’s GDP will be on par with China and become the world’s top three economies.

A power of more than one billion people can never be underestimated, although India is a very weak country at the moment, and the lower limit is low; but the future development potential is very large, the upper limit is very high. Although China is now flourishing, if one day the country is facing an aging crisis, on one hand, fewer young people lead to a decline in the number of soldiers, on the other hand, the country has been undergoing such a crises a long period of time, the national willingness to fight is reduced. At that time, it will be much more difficult to deal with a potentially rising India than it is now.

**Chapter Two, the conflicts between China and India can hardly be reconciled**

It is difficult to reconcile the China-India conflict, just as it was difficult to reconcile the China-Soviet conflict before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The underlying reasons are not explained by ideology, territorial disputes, cultural differences, or foreign policy.

In the 1960s and 1980s, China’s greatest threat was from none other than the Soviet Union. If a torrent of Soviet tanks goes south from Mongolia, it will hit Beijing within a week. Since ancient times, the greatest external threat to China has been from the North. And in modern times, Soviet Russia has assumed this role. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was unprecedentedly powerful and had nothing better than a torrent of armored tanks. This was similar to ancient cavalry, fast and ruthless, able to tear a hole in the opponent's defenses in a very short time

The key issue is that during the Cold War, the Soviet Union maintained absolute geographic superiority . The Soviet Union not only controlled the outer northeast, but also Mongolia. When the Soviet Union did not control Mongolia, if the Soviet Union wanted to attack China, it still had to go south from the Northeast Plain and enter North China after conquering the Shanhai pass. But with control of the Mongolian Plateau, the Soviet Union faced much fewer obstacles when attacking China. Soviet tanks only had to cross the Yinshan Mountains to enter Hebei. After that, Beijing would be basically insecure to defend. In this case, China may only have to move south like the Central Plains dynasties in the past, and use the southern rivers as a line to fight against the Soviet army.

This is the fundamental reason why China would fight with the Soviet Union during the Cold War and cooperate with the West without hesitation. As long as Mongolia is controlled by the Soviet Union, China’s national defense cannot be assured. Thanks to an independent mongolia, China and Russia are moving towards reconciliation, in the long run, due to Russia's natural geopolitical suppression, it is still a potential threat, and China and Russia still guard against each other.

Taking the example of the Soviet Union, we can understand why Sino-Indian relations are difficult to reconcile. ***The geography of India is very similar to China The main population centers of China are on the North China Plain, and Beijing is the throat into the North China Plain. The population centers of India are on the Ganges Plain, and New Delhi is the throat to enter the Ganges Plain. The south has similar broken terrain and a long coastline, and the southeast has a large island like Sri Lanka.***

But compared to China, India's geography is extremely bad. All of the core areas of India are in the hands of other countries (Indus river, Lower Ganges, Siri Lanka). India does not have many natural barriers. The coastline is too long and it is easy to be attacked by east and west, while China only needs to defend the east. This makes India very easy to invade as seen in history. ***This is the reason why India invaded Tibet in the 1960s and maintained a relatively high military expenditure for a long time. It cannot be said that India is a militaristic state, but because in the context of geographical disadvantages, it can only maintain military balance by spending more than its opponents.***  
For India, China is the biggest geo-threat. This is because China not only controls the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but also is an ally with Pakistan. Once China and India go to war, India will almost certainly lose without external intervention. India’s Ganges plain is in danger and is at a great disadvantage. The geographical disadvantages of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the alliance between China and Pakistan are part of the reasons why China-India relations cannot be reconciled. ***But in the long run, even if China and India can complete the territorial conflicts and China and Pakistan no longer are allies, it will be difficult for China and India to reconcile completely. The reason is that both China and India want to become superpowers and leaders in Asia, inevitably leading to strategic collisions.***  
In the future, if both China and India want to rise up and become leaders in Asia, conflicts of interest will inevitably arise. The key point of the conflict is Southeast Asia, the backyard of both counties. Southeast Asia is extremely rich in resources and possesses the oil and rubber needed for war. On the other hand, Southeast Asia is characterized by scattered power and small countries. Forming battlegrounds for any major countries. China and India both have significant cultural and historical ties with the region. Southeast Asia has many Chinese and Indians. To a certain extent, Southeast Asia is to China and India what Latin America is to the United States, Eastern Europe is to Germany and Russia, and North Korea is to China and Japan. They belong to the range of interests that must be contested.

Therefore, if both China and India become stronger in the future, they are likely to fiercely compete for dominance in Southeast Asia. On land, India can rely on the northeast states to infiltrate Myanmar and radiate to the Indochina Peninsula. On the sea, India can rely on the Andaman Islands to increase its influence on the Southeast Asian islands. This is similar to China. On land, China relies on the Trans-Asian Railway/Pan-Asian Highway to increase its radiation to the Indochina Peninsula, and on the sea, it relies on the Nansha Islands to increase its influence on Southeast Asia.

***Therefore, Sino-Indian relations are difficult to reconcile unless three conditions are met: 1. China withdraws from Tibet, or the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau becomes a neutral buffer area similar to Mongolia; 2. China abandons support for Pakistan; 3. China and India abandon the competition for Southeast Asia. None of these three items can be done by China. Tibet is an indivisible part of our territory. Although India has long supported ""Tibet independence"", it is impossible for China to give up Tibet. It is also impossible for China to give up support for Pakistan, Because once you let India unify South Asia, India will be the spearhead aimed at our country. Even more difficult to deal*** ***with. It*** ***is also impossible to give up Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is our natural economic backyard, and has economic and military dual significance.***

In the short term, the main contradictions are 1 and 2, but as India's national strength over Pakistan get bigger and bigger, we cannot rule out that one day Pakistan will be completely defeated by India or even annexed, by that time China's direct geopolitical threat to India will be greatly reduced, if India can also annex Nepal, Bhutan and other countries, then it will have a pivot point in the Tibetan Plateau, and it will be difficult for China to go over the Tibetan Plateau to directly invade India. At this time, the Sino-Indian territorial dispute will no longer be the main conflict, and the main conflict will change to a struggle for spheres of influence.

***The nature of India's threat is the same as that of Russia and Japan; it is a territorial and existential threat. India, on the one hand, has ambitions to encroach on our territory, which is different from the United States, which focuses on economic interests. India also has attempts to dominate South Asia and encroach on Southeast Asia. When China is strong, both the United States and India will adopt a hostile policy toward China; but when China is in decline, the United States may relax its restrictions , but India will not. If one day India is strong and China is weak, then India will intensify its aggression against our territory and even threaten the safety of our national life and property.***

**Chapter Three, the dilemma of two-front warfare, China does not occupy an absolute advantage on the Sino-Indian border**

***The Chinese front is too long and needs to be guarded separately.***

To the east is Japan and South Korea, to the southeast is Taiwan that has not yet returned, to the south are the Southeast Asian countries with territorial disputes, and to the north is Russia, which has occupied the most territory in China in history. In the west of our country, the situation is more complicated. There are religious and ethnic conflicts in Xinjiang and Tibet, and India is eyeing them. This means that although our country is strong, it needs to be guarded by separate troops

Division of Chinese theaters and deployment of forces:

Northern Theater -- 3 army groups, North Sea Fleet-- Russia, Korean Peninsula

Eastern Theater -- 3 army groups, East China Sea Fleet, half of the air force-- U.S., Japan, Taiwan

Southern Theater -- 2 army groups, South China Sea Fleet-- United States, Southeast Asian countries

Central Theater -- 3 armies-- Guards the capital and reserve for other war zones

Western Theater-- 2 armies-- India

Division of Indian military districts and deployment of forces:

Northern Military District -- 3 army groups -- Kashmir, the western section of the China-India border

Western Military Region -- 4 army groups -- Middle section of the China-India border

Eastern Military Region -- 3 armies, East Sea Fleet -- Eastern section of the China-India border

Central Military Region -- 1 army -- Guarding the capital

Southwest Military Region-- 1 army --- Pakistan

Southern Military Region -- 2 armies, West Sea Fleet -- Guarding South India

India can use most of its military power against China. The Indian army has 1.15 million troops and has a total of 14 armies, of which 10 are dedicated to fighting China, accounting for 70% of its army. As for the navy, when a war breaks out between China and India, if the United States and India have good relations, India can send its entire navy to the Andaman Islands to block the Strait of Malacca. While most of the Chinese navy will be deployed in the Pacific to confront the United States and Japan. In terms of air force, northern India has a flat terrain and numerous airports, which can accommodate all the fighters of the Indian Air Force. However, there are not enough airports in Tibet to park a large number of fighters. ***If a large-scale war breaks out between China and India, how much force can be used to fight against India?***

It may be difficult for China to deploy troops on a large scale to support the battlefield, because each army group has clear responsibilities. Once a large number of troops are deployed, it will inevitably lead to weakness and give other countries a chance. For example, the 82nd Army is used to guard the capital , the 82nd Army is equipped to fight on the Great Plains, its plateau combat ability is not a strong point  
***This means that once a large-scale war breaks out between China and India, we may only be able to mobilize 5 army groups to fight, while the Indian side can mobilize at least 10 armies in response.*** Due to restrictions on the throughput of Tibet’s airports, the number of soldiers that can be sent to Tibet is also relatively limited, and most of the air force still has to stay in the east to confront the United States and Japan. As the Strait of Malacca is controlled by other countries, the possibility of our navy crossing the Strait of Malacca and fighting the Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean is currently unlikely. Therefore, theoretically speaking, China would have to use 40% of the army, less than half of the air force, and close to 0% of the navy in the Sino-Indian war against 70% of the Indian army, close to 100% of the navy and air force. Currently, I believe that if there is no external interference, China can defeat India with only half of its military power. however, In the most likely situation for war, although our military is far stronger than India, it does not occupy an absolute advantage.

***In short, in the context of a potential encounter, China has several major disadvantages against India:***

***1. China's main strategic focus is in the east, 70% of its military power will be used to confront the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and it will not be able to spare a hand to deal specifically with India.***

***2. Since 2016, the United States has gradually locked China as its number one competitor. If China starts a war against India, if it is a protracted war, the United States and the West will inevitably intervene. At that time, there may be wars in Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula, and the South China Sea. Creating a 2 fronts situation***

***3. 60% of China's oil imports pass through the Strait of Malacca, and a large amount of export trade also goes through this place. Once fighting against India begins, India or the US may take advantage by blockading the Strait of Malacca. China's crude oil reserves can only support 6-12 months during the war***

***4. The risks and pressures of the two- front warfare can be handled in a war against India. However, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is complex and the railway cannot support the logistics required for large-scale military operations.***

&#x200B;

 **Chapter 5: Regaining Taiwan is a prerequisite for resolving the Indian issue**

The importance of Taiwan is self-evident. First , Taiwan is a barrier to the southeastern coast. If Taiwan is controlled by an enemy country, the southeast coast of China, the most developed economic area, will become the frontline. Enemy aircraft can take off from Taiwan and bomb Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuhan, etc. Secondly, Taiwan is a springboard for China's eastward exit into the Pacific. If Taiwan is recovered, the East China Sea Fleet can be stationed at Keelung Port. The US and Japan’s naval and air bases will easily become targets for our military, and the United States may shrink the line of defense from Ryukyu to Guam. Around. Therefore, for our country, the strategic value of Taiwan at the moment is far greater than that of Mongolia and southern Tibet.

At present, our military's technical means to regain Taiwan are mature. Our military far exceeds Taiwan's in terms of scale and equipment. The navy, air force, and rocket forces can suppress Taiwan in all directions. The biggest problem in regaining Taiwan lies in US interference. The United States' support to Taiwan can be described as unscrupulous. It not only sells equipment to Taiwan, but also allows the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar to be undervalued, allowing Taiwan to enjoy a high trade surplus. This is a treatment that Japan and South Korea do not enjoy. Taiwan is a trump card for the United States to beat China, so the United States will not easily give up. 

***There is a view that the United States will not go to war with China for Taiwan. This view underestimates the determination of the United States to defend its world hegemony. With the rapid rise of China, the United States has already regarded China as its number one competitor.*** Taiwan being the core trump card for the United States to check and balance China. Once the mainland regains Taiwan, the United States will not only lose the Taiwan card, but will also produce a series of domino effects. Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia may fall to China because of the US inaction. By then, the US front in the Western Pacific will be at risk of collapse. In recent years, the United States has tried to suppress China's rise by various means including tariffs, technology, finance, and diplomacy, but they have not achieved the expected results. Therefore, the possibility that the United States may adopt military measures to suppress China in the future cannot be ruled out. The United States may not go to war with China for Taiwan itself, but the United States is likely to use Taiwan as an excuse to go to war with China. A similar example is that in 1914, in order to suppress the rise of Germany, the United Kingdom directly declared war on Germany under the pretext that Germany invaded Belgium and undermined neutrality. Before that, German domestic public opinion believed that Belgium was not worthy of the British war. This strategic misjudgment led to The outbreak of World War I. 

***After regaining Taiwan, China's geopolitical situation will be greatly improved.*** The first is the economic hinterland—the southeast coast- will gain an extra barrier. By then, the East China Sea Fleet can deploy to Taiwan and extend the maritime defense zone by 500 kilometers. The land defense situation will also be improved. First of all, the Eastern Theater will no longer need to maintain the size of the three army groups. The 73rd army stationed in Fujian can be transferred to the western theater to fight against India.",geopolitics,Trump
49,Pakistans Two Front War,488.0,mf2wxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/mf2wxj/pakistans_two_front_war/,168.0,1616945078.0,"One thing that really stuck with me for the last few years was a warning from Obama to Trump when Obama left the White House. Obama warned Trump that the geopolitical situation he worried about the most was the border between India and Pakistan, that the situation there could spiral way out of control very quickly and the consequences would be devastating. If you factor in the nuclear weapons both sides here process it is pretty easy to see why the stakes are so high on this one, and how any escalation in this theatre may push Pakistan into a ""use them or lose them"" line of thinking in the event India were to push across the border. 

To take this further we put together a panel of experts to talk through this exact problem, and what it means for the region.

This week on the panel.

\- AYESHA JALAL (Tufts University)  
\- ADAM WEINSTEIN (Quincy Institute)  
\- ANDREW SMALL (German Marshall Fund)

As I see it Pakistan faces a two-front war, one against its historical rival India; and the other being internal factors that pull at the fabric of the Pakistani nation. Pakistan has many geographical advantages, but also many disadvantages. One of the major disadvantages is their reliance on the Indus river, as this river supplies the majority of the country's water and internal transportation. The river is the lifeblood of Pakistan, but it originates in the Kasmiri region of the Himalayas. Pakistan knows that if any more of Kasmir were to be occupied by the Indians it would put New Dehli in a position to build dams on the river tributaries and control the flow of water into Pakistan, a situation our expert from Tufts tells us would almost certainly push Pakistan into war with India. There is almost no way Pakistan could ever be comfortable with New Dehli having that much leverage over them at any point. 

The geography of a war between India and Pakistan is also terrifying as well for Islamabad, as once again the situation is stacked against them. Most of Pakistans major cities like Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore are less than a few 100km from the Indian frontlines, meaning if the Indians were to pull off a massive surprise attack (although that is very difficult in today's satellite age) the Indian army could be approaching the outskirts of these cities in a matter of days or hours. In the case of Islamabad, India's starting positions are only 86km from the outskirts of the city; meaning Pakistani leadership would have little time to formulate a response to the attack. This may force them to panic and turn to tactical nuclear weapons to slow the rapid Indian advance, but once the nuclear genie is out of the bottle is it very hard to put it back in. India may fear it is only the first wave and seek to use their nuclear arms to destroys as many of Pakistan's missiles as they can before they can be launched. All in all, a terrifying set of circumstances. 

As we so often find when we research these pieces colonial borders are often the source of internal problems, and I am not even going to get into the whole Kasmir situation. Pakistan has the Baloch people (split between Iran and Pakistan) seeking independence, and the Pashtun people (split between Afghanistan and Pakistan) both seeking independence. If the Baloch manage to pull away it would destroy much of the Chinese coastal investment that has been sunk into the country, and if the Pashtuns manage to pull away it would take a huge chunk of the Pakistani heartland with it. Pakistan tries to keep the lid on these two groups but other actors such as India seek to rile them up.  India for years has attempted to improve its relationships with Afghanistan hoping to turn them against Pakistan and form a two-front war, and on occasion they have pushed Kabul slightly in that direction. 

The real game at the moment though around Pakistan is between Beijing and Washington. Washington needs Pakistan for a logistical route into Afghanistan, as well as a potential jumping-off point for operations in Iran, Central Asia or Western China. Washington is also keenly aware that if Pakistan were to crumble it would likely become a much worse hotbed for terrorism than Afghanistan ever was, and if that were to spill over into domestic upheaval that may place nuclear arms in the hands of whoever takes control.

China though wants Pakistan for two completely different reasons. The first is as a way around any possible blockade of the South China Sea, hoping that Pakistan could accept the goods China needs into its Southern ports and then transport those goods up Pakistan and into Western China, but the trouble is that road they built to achieve this actually snakes into Indian territory for a few miles; and additionally due to it being high up in the mountains it would be even easier to cut off than the South China Sea would be. The second use China has for Pakistan is a wedge against India, knowing that tensions between Islamabad and New Dehli force India to concentrate its forces toward Pakistan, rather than China. 

I don't think it would happen any time soon but in the horrifying case of a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan the likely overall winner of the situation would be China, with India having to suffer the devastation and China unscathed. 

I don't think nuclear war is ""likely"" between these two, but if I had to pick the area of the world it was most likely to occur in I would probably pick this one. 

Thanks again to this sub for all of your articles and recommendations, I would love to get your thoughts on the piece and the questions below? 

How likely do you think nuclear war is here? 

Would a trade corridor from Gwadar to Western China actually work in the event of a South China Sea Blockade? 

What would be the most like event to trigger off a war between these two, and how far into Pakistani territory do you think Indian tanks would have to get before Islamabad considered a nuclear response?

Some examples of this: 

[House Passes Uighur Human Rights Bill, Prodding Trump to Punish China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/us/politics/house-uighurs-china-sanctions.html)

[UK, US, Australia and Canada scold China over Hong Kong law](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-britain-idUSKBN23425F)

[US Pledges Support to Taiwan, Amid Deepening China Tensions](https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/us-pledges-support-taiwan-amid-deepening-china-tensions)

China has so far lacked the soft power or the political will to retaliate in any meaningful way on this front but with their investments in American media companies and data collection abilities from various successful tech conglomerates they are poised to change that. 

Also the recent willingness of Chinese diplomats and civil servants to retaliate against “deliberate insults” by the west has seen the rise of figures like [Zhao Lijian](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/asia/china-wolf-warrior-diplomacy-intl-hnk/index.html) in the CCP. A counselor at the Chinese embassy in Pakistan, Lijian was promoted as the Deputy Director of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department after his outspoken criticism of America’s various societal issues like racism, income inequality, and rampant gun violence. Since him many other party members of the CCP have taken on a more confrontational tone vis-a-vis the west, a phenomenon that has been colloquially termed *wolf diplomacy* in both American and Chinese media circles. 

With racial tensions reaching a zenith and riots ensuing in the state of Minnesota, along with other smaller protests in various states across the US, is there potential for the Chinese government to capitalize on the discontent and develop the capability to influence events inside the United States?",geopolitics,Trump
56,I think Turkey is an extremely misunderstood US partner. Here's my two cents.,462.0,o0jyfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/o0jyfb/i_think_turkey_is_an_extremely_misunderstood_us/,186.0,1623778652.0,"Turkey opposes Russia in basically every front imaginable. Libya (where France’s support is against USA's interest), Syria, Azerbaijan, Ukraine etc, everywhere Turkey is in direct opposition to Russian position.

Forget about Libya, Syria, Azerbaijan maybe (I mean you know those very well). 

Take Ukraine, Turkey is doing what France or Germany should have been doing there. Making military agreements. Yet, as far as I can tell, Turkey doesn’t really hugely benefit neither does Ukraine have any ""huge"" geopolitical significance for Turkey. Granted, a bigger role by someone like Germany is needed to actually stop Russian aggression there.

Similarly, take Afghanistan, after ""official"" US soldiers, Turkey has the highest number of troops there. For what you ask? To serve US interest.

Turkey is also hosting 3.5M refugees or something like that (which is a pretty significant burden). I mean hosting that many people could destabilise entire country’s political balance.

Turkey also plays vital role in many other areas of geopolitical significance for the USA. Too many to write in one sitting.

Yet, there seems to be considerably negative public opinion on Turkey among the populace. Especially in Reddit and Youtube.

Also, the media spins surrounding Turkey also seems to be negative.

But I think this is bad for USA's relations with Turkey. As I think alienating Turkey would ultimately lead to them entering the Chinese sphere of influence.

One thing people point out is Turkey’s power projection. A lot of which is in fact, in support of USA's interest.

Also, Turkey seems to be growing in influence around the region and the Muslim populace. But, I mean, come on. If Turkey develops economically, it is inevitable that its influence would grow and so would its significance. What ultimately matters is that Turkey keeps on performing its roles in USA's interests.

Some people point out that, Turkey purchased the S400, therefore, Turkey is joining the Russia belt. But this line of thinking completely avoids any of the ground reality.

Turkey is a sworn enemy of Russia in almost every geopolitical spaces they are fighting in.

India is also in on S400. Should USA also distance itself from India for that reason? No.

Now, some people point out about growing authoritarianism in Turkey. But this is a complete bs non-issue.
As long as USA's interest is being performed by a country, USA never cares about what goes on within that country. Dictators, human rights violations etc all are done or present in Saudi Arabia, Israel and the other usual suspects. USA itself is probably the biggest savage of all. I don't think authoritarian tendencies should concern the USA as long as that country performs USA's geopolitical interests.

Now, regarding authoritarianism. I don't think Erdogan can do anything if he loses an election. The Turkish state is much bigger than Erdogan.
He is kinda like Trump. Popular among rural voters, conservative voters. And just like Trump, the more the media vilifies Erdogan, the more vote he gets.

But, just as Trump failed to do anything when he failed the election, Erdogan will also be unable to do anything. However, vilifying his voter base could even lead to him winning the election.

Although I think Erdogan will lose the next election due to the ongoing economic challenges in Turkey and the ongoing currency crisis.

Thus, I think this constant narrative of ""Turkey bad"" is incredibly harmful for US's geopolitical interests. And we should try to have more nuance while talking about this country. 
Moreover, pushing Turkey against USA would mean an incredibly useful and resourceful country will become antagonistic to our country. If USA were to win against the Chinese threats, it would be more useful if USA and Turkey remained true partners. 

Might I also point out that Turkey is probably the only Muslim country that has denounced Chinese aggression against Uyghurs in an official capacity, unlike some other so called allies of the USA.

TL;DR: USA and Turkey have a good partnership. Recent media and popular narrative against Turkey is unhelpful for overall geopolitical interest of the USA.",geopolitics,Trump

This is essentially a state sponsored aquisition. The US is using it's political leverage to force the hand of one of the most popular apps in the world. The fact that Trump thinks the US government should get a portion of money for brokering the deal is a slippery slope (imo). It shows that the government is now a corporate entity, except one that weilds a military and has the power of law on its side. Not to mention that any deal like this could only involve high cap companies that can afford it. The biggest companies in the US will benefit from this in the short term.

I can see a future where this new kind of economic warfare leads to severing the deep ties of the US and Chinese economies. China already does this to some extent (the US too) but never before have I seen such blatant anti-free-market policy from the US, the leaders of globalism!

I doubt the CCP will just let it slide. They already block some US tech companies like Facebook from operating but they're still many that have a large Chinese presence (Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Disney). If Microsoft buys TikTok I could see it hurting Microsoft's bottom line in China. 

I think this could usher in an age of unentangling of the two economies. If the Chinese did something similar with the above companies, and instead promoted their own state sponsored companies, share prices of these huge US companies would tank, and considering they make up a large portion of the S&P 500, the stock market as a whole could tank.

How could the Chinese retaliate? They obviously don't have the capabilities to replace these companies yet but I think it's almost a guarantee they're thinking about it. The Chinese and US economies are so deeply tied that a separation would hurt both sides enormously. Not to mention China owns a large portion of US debt.

Then there's the fact that China cannot  stand up to the US militarily so they're limited in their power projection.

71,US ban on Huawei is a gamble.,381.0,bqzuvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/bqzuvl/us_ban_on_huawei_is_a_gamble/,128.0,1558379480.0,"For the ICT industry, the US blockade of Huawei is actually a gamble.

Most of the global ICT manufacturing industry chain and brands are concentrated in East Asia. There are five global chip buyers in the East Asia region (Samsung, Huawei, Lenovo, BBK, Xiaomi). Among Apple's 200 largest global suppliers, 139 (almost 70%) are from East Asia. At the same time, for the 807 factories of Apple's 200 largest suppliers worldwide, only 62(7.7%) in the United States. while 605 in East Asia (China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan), accounting for 75%, of which China accounts for 47.76%. USA is actually marginalized in this manufacturing field. Beyond the East Asian industrial chain, the United States is like an isolated island, so it must remain open, participate and integrate into the East Asian industrial chain.

&#x200B;

Most of the components manufacturing involved in the ICT industry have long gone in the United States.

It is difficult for this industry chain to return to the United States. Currently the unemployment rate in the United States is not high, so the manufacturing industry can only attrract talents by offering higher salaries. At the same time the demographic changes in the United States are also difficult to support large-scale manufacturing employment.

&#x200B;

The biggest advantage of Americans lies in the semiconductor designing and the manufacturing of some semiconductor products. The United States is far away from East Asia, which is the center of ICT manufacturing, and this is a natural disadvantage.

&#x200B;

Because the component suppliers and down stream product brands are gathered in East Asia, they have their own will to purchase semiconductor products. In other words, If I am a customer, I have my own choice, I can buy from you or buy from others.

Currently, American companies have advantages in the semiconductor technology, so the downstream companies have no choice, they have to buy from USA to participate in the division of labor to obtain profits.

&#x200B;

The United States promoting the blockade of Huawei, in fact, is promoting China to invest more at the core advantages of the United States, and once China catches up in this area and finds that it can fully realize the internal circulation of the ICT industry, without the need to purchase from US companies thousands of miles away, then the US semiconductor industry, being far away from the East Asian industry chain manufacturing center, will only be gradually replaced.

&#x200B;

This story has happened a lot. an example is Shenzhen Huiding Technology. The world's largest fingerprint identification company is in Europe --- Sweden's FPC, and when Chinese companies found that Huiding's domestic fingerprint identification chips are also capable enough, OPPO, VIVO, Huawei, and others have all switched to Huiding, so there are no opportunities for similar companies in Europe and the United States anymore, they have to gradually withdraw from the industrial chain.

&#x200B;

In this sense, USA is playing with fire. If USA insists on blocking Huawei for one or two years, then for the United States, those American technology companies with weaker technology will be affected first, because one year later, They will find out that they have been replaced by local Chinese suppliers permanently, because the US government's crackdown on ZTE and Huawei has given Chinese local chip companies that did not have the opportunity to participate in market competition.

Once you are replaced, it is very difficult to enter the East Asian industry chain again. This is why it is so important for Americans to return manufacturing and the industrial chain to the United States.

&#x200B;

This is a competition in which China is scrambling for technological advances in the semiconductor field,

while the Americans are striving to maintain the advantages of semiconductor technology while get the industry chain returning to the United States.

At present, China already has a large number of global brands,  China's industrial chain also have a large number of component manufacturers ---- camera modules, CMOS sensors, mobile phone processors, OLED display panels, mobile phone lenses, glass covers, metal processing, FPC and circuit boards have successively made breakthroughs and being shipped on a large scale. SMIC's FinFET 12nm process, YMTC's 64 layer Nand Flash, Changxin's DRAM4 is about to be mass-produced in a few months.

&#x200B;

If the industry chain is firmly in the hands of China, then only the semiconductors will be left for the United States.

Once Chinese companies made technology breakthroughs, there is no need from the US companies. As long as the technology is on par for the two countries, the US products will be replaced soon, and once replaced, it will almost never come back.

&#x200B;

For Huawei, ZTE, OPPO, VIVO, and Xiaomi, since they can buy it in Shenzhen, why should they buy it from the United States?

The ZTE incident in 2018 lasted for almost three months from April to July. The US chip share has been permanently reduced in ZTE's procurement process. ZTE has increased its procurement of self-produced, domestically produced, and other non-US-based chips, which is a permanent loss for US semiconductor companies.

&#x200B;

Huawei's capacity is seven times that of ZTE. It is one of the only three billion-dollar electronic technology companies in the world. In 2018, Huawei's global semiconductor purchases reached US$21.131 billion, an increase of 45.2%. This is also why the US semiconductor company's stock has plummeted after Huawei received a ban.

&#x200B;

This also makes the United States face a situation:

If the ban is persistent, not only the semiconductor suppliers in the United States will be affected, after all, it is very painful to lose a large customer; At the same time, Huawei's customers around the world will also be affected, including the United States. The impact is global.

Even if this ban is revoked in the future, the share of US semiconductor companies in Huawei will be permanently lost or reduced, which will actually weaken the advantages of American semiconductor companies. In other words, once this decision is made, the United States will suffer a lot loss, whether or not the ban is lifted.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, If the Chinese government suddenly announces a ban on Samsung or Apple, China's domestic component suppliers cannot sell to Samsung or Apple. they will inevitably suffer severe loss. Once they were kicked out of the supply chain of Apple or Samsung, it would be difficult to join again. So Chinese government would not do that.

First, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates [deployed troops](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20181122-saudi-arabia-uae-send-troops-to-support-kurds-in-syria/) into Northern Syria to be stationed with American troops and their Kurdish allies.

Second, the United States [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/trump-syria-turkey-troop-withdrawal.html) that it was withdrawing all forces from Syria.

Third, the Kurds [asked](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/syrias-kurds-ask-assad-govt-for-protection) the Assad regime to protect them following the American withdrawal announcement.

And fourth, the Gulf states [began to join](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/12/28/bashar-al-assad-was-diplomatic-outcast-now-former-arab-adversaries-are-restoring-ties/?utm_term=.da0109a61404) other Arab states in restoring diplomatic ties with the Assad regime following the American withdrawal announcement.

In light of these developments, one has to ask: will we see a major geopolitical re-alignment in the Middle East in 2019?

Let's take these developments and put them into context. [As I have stated before](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/9ozhcd/have_saudi_arabia_and_turkey_entered_a_cold_war/), much of Saudi Arabia's -- and by extension the Gulf states minus Qatar's -- recent foreign policy has been in response to Turkey's growing power and potential to threaten the traditional Saudi/Gulf state hegemony of the Sunni world in general and the Sunni world within the Middle East in particular. If Saudi Arabia wants to contain Turkey, the both the deployment of Saudi and Emirati troops into Northern Syria and the Kurdish/Gulf state efforts to reconcile with Assad would absolutely make sense.

And if Assad accepts these olive branches, that could change everything.

No, that's not an understatement.

In the aftermath of such a scenario, we must pay close attention to five countries:

1. **Turkey**. Relations between Turkey and much of the Arab world are already at an all-time low. Turkey's relationship with Syria and Egypt have completely collapsed over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's support of anti-government movements in those countries. Meanwhile, tensions between Turkey and every Gulf state except Qatar have been growing for geopolitical (and to a lesser extent ideological) reasons. Turkey's relationship with Saudi Arabia in particular has deteriorated following the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. And then of course, there are the Kurds, no explanation needed there. A newly-found friendship between Assad, the Gulf states, and the Kurds would likely make their relations with Turkey even worse, as the Turks sense a clear attempt at containment in Northern Syria.
2. **Iran.** Iran's relations with the Gulf states (especially Saudi Arabia but minus Qatar) are even worse than Turkey's relations with those countries.  For this reason, there is a good chance that the Iranian response to a reconciliation between Assad and the Gulf states will be harsher than the Turkish response. But how far will Iran go? If history indicates anything, all options appear to be on the table. Just over a year ago, former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was assassinated by his former (Iranian-backed) Houthi allies after he attempted to reconcile with the Gulf States in the midst of a civil war in his country. If Iran and/or its proxies could turn against and/or kill Saleh over his communications with the Gulf states, then they could do the same with Assad. Should they pursue that course of action, there can be only two outcomes. First, if Assad is killed or overthrown, that would likely make the war in Syria much, *much* worse. Not only could such an event start a new wave of uprisings, we could also see some of Assad's former allies within the country *joining* those uprisings over the issue of Syria's relationship with Iran. Alternatively, if Assad is *not* killed or overthrown, the Syrian-Iranian alliance would collapse. Syria would defect from the pro-Iranian camp to the pro-Saudi camp, while Iran would switch sides in the war -- and perhaps form an alliance with Turkey in the process.
3. **Russia.** If the Syrian-Iranian alliance collapsed, Russia would face a serious predicament. It would be forced to choose which ally is more strategically important: Syria or Iran. If Russia chooses Syria, then it gets to keep its naval base in Tartus and enjoy better relations with the Gulf states, but it also loses any clout it once had with Iran and Turkey to use against American influence in the region and perhaps faces a greater risk of terrorist attacks on its soil. If Russia chooses Iran, then it solidifies the ""Eurasian Alliance"" with Iran and Turkey against American influence in the region, but it also loses its naval base in Tartus and perhaps suffers its greatest humiliation on the international stage since the end of the Cold War.
4. **The United States.** If the outcome of the reconciliation between Assad, the Gulf states, and the Kurds results in them moving closer to Russia, the United States could be very tempted to forge closer ties with Iran and Turkey to form a regional counterbalance. Should that happen, we could end up seeing Donald Trump doing a 180 on some of his current Middle East policies, such as opposition to a nuclear deal with Iran, recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and support of a Saudi-led ""Arab NATO.""
5. **Israel.** Israel's number one priority right now is Iran. If you're anti-Iran, you're the good guy, according to Israel. If Turkey, Russia, or the United States form closer ties with Iran as a result of the new re-alignment, odds are Israel's relations with those countries will seriously deteriorate in coming years.

One can construe various reasons that these travel ban extensions were made: in Nigeria, Boko Haram [continues](https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/boko-haram-nigeria) to destabilize the region, despite the potential of the Nigerian economy; Eritria and Sudan, respectively, have been a hub for piracy and there are still questions about the future of the Sudanese government. Myanmar has been a focal-point for human rights amidst a refugee crisis. The two on this list that do not fit any obvious policy are Tanzania and Kyrgyzstan.

In the case of Kyrgyzstan, however, it is less clear. Central Asia generally gets less coverage than the other states cited. There are several possible reasons:

* There have been a few issues with passport security. Last year, a scandal regarding Kyrgyzstan's introduction of a new biometric passport system surfaced after [allegations of bribery](https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/multimillion-passport-deal-under-investigation-in-kyrgyzstan) from the Lithuanian company that won the bid, Garsu Pasaulis, surfaced. I could not find any further information regarding the development of this investigation.
* Another separate scandal in which a Chinese-born Uyghur with a fake passport [reportedly](https://www.rferl.org/a/kyrgyz-protesters-call-for-punishment-for-those-involved-in-corruption-scandal/30331892.html) funneled around $1 billion out of the country through a money-laundering operation. It is especially damaging when not only was the accused, Aierken Saimaiti, was seen at the President Jeenbekov's 2017 inauguration. Saimaiti was found shot dead on November 10 in Turkey.

Certainly, these are issues: but are they worth banning travel for [students](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/im-an-american-in-kyrgyzstan-the-travel-ban-has-my-us-loving-students-despairing/2020/02/11/3c0321e6-491a-11ea-b4d9-29cc419287eb_story.html) and ordinary citizens? On the Eastern side of Europe, we can see similar corrupt practices, such as Moldova's infamous [$10 billion theft](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2016/08/01/billion-dollar-theft-in-moldova-one-rich-bankers-crime-has-a-nation-doing-time/#27a018024f7e) by Plahotniuc - this has not warranted a travel ban. And even with the *new* passport system compromised by corruption, would not the original passport system be sufficient? As the stakes are raising with US/CCP, does the Kyrgyz passport issues and its possible exposure to Xinjiang Province border, could this be a factor? This is speculation, but its worth considering.

The reason I ask these questions is because the US has generally had a stake in Kyrgyzstan. The US had a military base in the country until 2014. The country has been hailed as one of the few ""genuinely"" democratic countries of Central Asia. Compared to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, it stands out as a country that has been willing to tolerate political freedoms and espouse democratic values. Even more, it is the site of a potential Uzbek-Kyrgyz Railway that has considerable [problems](https://www.mei.edu/publications/ferghana-valley-railway-should-never-be-built) with [funding](https://www.railfreight.com/beltandroad/2019/11/04/from-china-to-iran-via-kyrgyzstan-is-faster-rail-link-real/) and development, specifically in relation to the ""debt-trap"" argument.

The proposed railway would potentially aid the Iranian economy. It is the most convenient route from China to reach Iranian/Turkish/Western European markets. This is a potential red-flag for the State Dept; however, why the US would double down and isolate Kyrgyzstan does not make much sense to me, if the US wishes to retain any influence in the Chinese periphery - which to me, would seem logical. To me, it appears to be poor judgment in US Foreign Policy interests, as it simply gives up on the Kyrgyz card, purposefully giving up on supporting a genuine Central Asian democracy unlike any other in the region.

In short, what I believe is happening is the United States is truly turning its back on developing democracies in support of containing the Belt and Road Initiative, given Kyrgyzstan's geopolitical position and the US' desire to get out of Afghanistan. It is in indication that the United States is no longer committed to even promoting democracy abroad, but a pure realist strategy that abandons legitimate gains in democratic institutions and human rights, even if they are flawed, in pursuit of greater geopolitical objectives.",geopolitics,Trump

President Donald Trump threatened a new escalation of the trade war with China, saying US tariffs on Chinese goods would be “raised very substantially” if no truce was reached with officials in Beijing. 

Mr Trump’s comments at the Economic Club of New York highlight the trouble the US administration is having in its efforts to strike an interim deal with China that would bring a halt to the commercial conflict afflicting the world’s two largest economies. 

After Mr Trump announced that a tentative agreement had been secured in early October, US and Chinese officials have been haggling over the details, including where a deal would be signed and whether Washington would roll back existing levies as part of such a settlement.


Mr Trump said a “significant phase one deal with China” remained “close” and “could happen soon”, as Beijing was “dying to make a deal”. But he also warned that higher levies would follow if the talks faltered.

I tell it to everybody: If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs

President Donald Trump on US trade talks with China
The US has placed 25 per cent tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports and 15 per cent tariffs on a further $112bn of Chinese goods. It has threatened new 15 per cent tariffs on a further $156bn of Chinese products in December. 

“I tell it to everybody: If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs, they are going to be raised very substantially,” Mr Trump warned. 

Mr Trump used the speech in New York, his hometown, to defend his administration’s protectionist trade policies and his economic record ahead of next year’s presidential election campaign

He said his administration had “delivered on our promises and exceeded our expectations” after nearly three years in office, but blamed the Federal Reserve for restraining growth under his watch. 

The president, who has frequently challenged the Fed’s independence by demanding easier monetary policy, said the US was at a “competitive disadvantage” because it had not followed the eurozone into the land of negative rates. 

“Give some of that money, I want some of that money,” he said. The Fed has cut interest rates three times this year, after raising them last year, but has since suggested it will pause easing for the time being. 

Mr Trump’s remarks came at a pivotal moment in his presidency, on the eve of public impeachment hearings over the Ukraine scandal in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and less than a year from the 2020 presidential election. Mr Trump wants to tout his economic prowess as a key selling point in the 2020 campaign, in a bid to hold on to the swing voters who propelled him to the White House in the race against Hillary Clinton in 2016. 

“We have ended the war on American workers, we have stopped the assault on American industry, and we have launched an economic boom the likes of which we have never seen before,” Mr Trump said. 

Despite record highs in US stock markets, persistently low unemployment and strong consumption, there have been some warning signs for the US president about the health of the economy. The pace of growth has slowed throughout the year, with both agricultural producers and manufacturers in the American heartland bearing the brunt of the trade wars and weakening global output. 

This has exposed Mr Trump to criticism from Democrats that his policies have backfired, failing to live up to their promise of boosting the prospects of average middle-class households Despite all the pressure exerted through tariffs, the US administration has failed to secure any major concessions from China on the toughest trade issues like industrial subsidies and the theft of intellectual property. 

US agrees limited trade deal with China
Andy Green, managing director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think-tank, said: “This laughable cheerleading in front of Wall Street pretty much sums up Trump’s economic agenda: no real results for the country at large, but delivering for the titans of Wall Street and corporate monopolies.”

Mr Trump’s more pugnacious, protectionist approach to trade has been a cornerstone of his economic agenda from the beginning of his presidency — and many businesses have complained that the uncertainty it created has frozen their investment plans.

But Mr Trump appeared to reject those claims. He said: “They were totally down. Now they’re a little bit down because a little bit, perhaps, the uncertainty of trade wars. But there is no uncertainty.”

As they await word on the US-China talks, investors and officials are also closely watching Mr Trump’s decision, expected this week, on whether to impose tariffs on car imports, after labelling them a threat to national security. Mr Trump did not mention the issue, which is a big risk to EU carmakers in particular, but the administration is expected to grant Brussels a new reprieve from the levies.",geopolitics,Trump

First of all, I'm of the belief that the core issue behind these protests is economic. The most fervent protestors are all youths who see no hope for the future. Those in high school find it hard to get into college because they have to compete with mainlanders. Graduated from college? Good luck getting a job having to compete with experienced mainlanders and foreigners. They see rich mainlanders buying up properties they can never ever hope to afford. Starting a family is out of the question unless you and your new wife are going to live with your parents. Moving is not an option. They are stuck on an island and they have no hope for the future.

That's why they resort to violence and aggressive tactics. It's also why they are trying to appeal to Trump for intervention even though they're smart enough to know he won't. And why they demand universal suffrage despite knowing Xi would never agree. No hope means nothing to lose.

They won't stop until China is forced to declare martial law and sends in the troops. I'm of the belief that their endgame is to invite CCP to commit Tiananmen part 2 right on their doorstep. They want it all to go to hell with the world watching because only then do they have outs. Outs via asylum claims to NA/EU in the face of CCP brutality.

From the CCP's perspective, they don't want another Tiananmen on their hands. Too much flak over these past decades for the first one. Too much risk of economic sanctions. They don't want to disrupt the economy. Thus they'll try to enforce martial law with overwhelming numbers of soldiers wielding nerf weapons. 

The final scene of the film goes like this. The red army and protestors clashing on the streets of HK, with protestors using guerrilla tactics to invite violence and Chinese soldiers trying to arrest everyone without killing anyone. Many are arrested and sent to re-education camps while the ones that make it out resettle overseas and find hope again.

Anyways, my 2 cents. Thanks for reading.",geopolitics,Trump

China is cutting tariffs on non-US goods to compensate for its US tariffs.  EU, Japanese, and Korean companies stand to benefit the most from this deal, which is estimated to bring $8.7B in tariff relief on an unspecified amount of imports.

This represents a further integration of China into the world economy, while accelerating the decoupling between the US and other major economies.  In addition, this shows that the Chinese government, for all its bluster, is keenly aware of the true cost and aim of US tariffs - to decrease incentives for Western corporations to upskill and upgrade the Chinese economy - and wants to make sure that door remains open for as long as possible.",geopolitics,Trump

I’m not a Putin paid troll, I’m actually an engineer. I also never voted for Putin and not going to cause I disagree with him on 2/3 of his internal policy. But this fact doesn’t mean that I can’t put myself in his shoes and guess what and why he’s doing. I also happen to watch American news sometimes and I haven’t seen there any explanation of this new crisis more sophisticated than “Putin is a dictator who wants to invade Ukraine for the sake of his self-esteem”. This situation forced me to write this post.

Let’s go back in time and remember Caribbean crisis. It all started with the United States deploying their intermediate range missiles in Turkey and the USSR replying with similar missiles in Cuba. For those people who never actually cared reding about missile types here is the shortest review ever:

Short-range ballistic missile: < 500km range.

Shorter-range ballistic missile: 500-1000km range.

Intermediate-range ballistic missile: 1000-5500km range.

Long-range ballistic missile: > 5500km range.

For obvious reasons, the shorter the range, the lower the price, which leads to deployment of intermediate (and shorter) range missiles to be pretty cheap which allows escalation to be fast and more dangerous. Ultimately this crisis lead to understanding of how dangerous this rocket spamming is and in 1987 the treaty was signed called Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty which banned both Soviet Union and the US from deployment and development of shorter and intermediate range ballistic missiles. There are other treaties which were signed close to the end of Cold War such as New START, which reduced the quantity of nuclear devices in both countries, Treaty on Open Skies, which allows unarmed aerial surveillance flights over the entire territory of its participants, Treaty on the Limitation of Missile Defense Systems and so on.

Those treaties lead us to this world we know where people don’t think of nuclear weapon much and war in general isn't somethink thought about often, at least in developed countries and many other places such as Russia or China. Ultimately, all those treaties created a balance where nor Russia nor the US can spam enough missiles to flood the world with them, can’t build a Missile Defense Systems large enough to counter those ballistic missiles which are still allowed for the other side and this guaranty mutual destruction in case of nuclear war. This measures also ensure that any nuclear strike if one is to happen anyway, leaves some time to talk it out while missiles are in flight (about 40 minutes). All of this prevents hot heads from actually wondering about what if… It’s mutual destruction. Period.

On December 13, 2001, George Bush announced the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the Treaty on the Limitation of Missile Defense Systems.

On August 2, 2019 Donald Trump announced the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

On November 22, 2020, Donald Trump announced the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the Treaty on Open Skies.

Currently we only have New START left which was signed by Putin and Biden right after US elections left. So now there is nearly no obligations which prevent new Caribbean crisis from happening. And of course Putin is concerned about it. Now there are talks about Ukraine joining NATO. It’s just impossible for Russia to tolerate such thing because from Ukraine it’s less than 500km range to Moscow, cause the only way for Russia to enter the Atlantic ocean (nearly entire Russian trade goes there) is through Black See, and for many other reasons known in details to Russian military only.

During Caribbean crisis such threats to mutual safety lead to understanding of the danger by both sides, but now we don’t have such understanding. NATO is consuming ex-soviet countries, all the treaties ensuring mutual safety are being cancelled by the US and all concerns of Russia are ignored.

Let's suppose Mexico has joined a military alliance with China and is deploying chines military on the US boarder in 1 minute flight time from Washington. There won’t be any time to talk if missiles are launched, there won’t be any way to stop it in flight. There won’t be any defense from it which is economically possible. The idea that US government would say that it's fine, Mexico is a free country, we are fine with chineese missiles on our border is unbeliavable. And the Caribbean crisis is a proof of this.

Still Russian concerns are ignored. And this is why all of this war talks went this far. This invasion is actually possible in only one case: the case of NATO actually offering Ukraine to join, and Putin being left without a diplomatic solution of this. Nobody in Russia wants this conflict to happen, because what’s the point? American sanctions already decreased salary in dollars for people of Russia more than two times since 2014. Economical profit for Russia in case of invasion? None. Putin’s rating? It would fall cause people care about their salaries more than about anything else and nobody supports wars where you're actually supposed to fighn yourself and in case of this supposed war risks of mobilisation are pretty high. So there will be no Russian invasion unless NATO military are deployed there. And I really hope that americans are going to put yourself in our shoes and understand that US government went too far pretending Russia has no right to have any concerns about its safety while US are allowed to do anything not bothering to think about other countries interests.",geopolitics,Trump

\[SS: Cambanis argues that it is in the US interest to maintain the Liberal International Order (LIO). The inherent advantages of the LIO to America more than compensate for the costs of leadership and public goods provision. First, the costs are not as high as imagined: defense spending constitutes a huge jobs subsidy. Second, primacy is an insurance policy as it provides the US with a disproportional voice in any decisions that might change future global conditions, without which conditions might change to America's disadvantage. Third, America is able to tilt the world trade and economic systems to its advantage. \]

""Is U.S. Primacy a Burden or a Benefit?"" 

\[A Response to ""It Pays to be the World's Policeman--Literally""\]

Author: John Glaser

[https://www.cato.org/blog/us-primacy-burden-or-benefit](https://www.cato.org/blog/us-primacy-burden-or-benefit)

\[SS: Glaser counters that there would be more economic 'giveback' from the US investing in more productive industries. He also makes the point that while the US may have the ability to tip economic scales in its favor, it's unclear the extent to which it has actually done so (e.g. the US didn't get better oil contracts in the Gulf). Moreover, if the US didn't incur massive costs being the global policeman, there would be no need to do so at all. Finally, Glaser questions the narrative that US military hegemony has been essential to securing most of the perceived benefits of the LIO, positing that nuclear weapons and a change in global attitudes towards war may have been more important factors.\]

OP's Comment

I think that trying to understand the relative and absolute distribution of benefits from US primacy/hegemony is perhaps the most important question in geopolitics/international relations today. I believe this is an enormously difficult question to answer, primarily because modern trade and economics are so incredibly complex. It is unclear that anyone truly understands them. Nevertheless, having even a best guess with respect to who benefits from US primacy seems like a basic precondition for analyzing current geopolitics, including what is the best path forward.

If we analogize the economy to the human body, than the financial system is like the circulatory system pumping capital to where it is needed most. In 2008, Wall Street, the system’s beating heart, failed spectacularly. In recent months, I have seen [scores ](https://warontherocks.com/2018/10/chinas-coming-financial-crisis-and-the-national-security-connection/)of [articles ](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2163897/could-china-find-itself-centre-next-financial-crisis-because-its-mounting)suggesting that China’s has the same types of clogs and leaks as Wall Street, and could be the epicenter of the next financial crisis. In today’s podcast episode, I am going to explore the Chinese financial system to get a better gauge of its health. I will discuss the massive state owned banks that dominate its financial sector, the rapid rise of the shadow banking industry, and the governments response to the massive buildup of debt in recent years.

To go back to our analogy of to the circulatory system, one can think of the Big 4 Chinese banks as the arteries of the system. Although these state owned giants have lost their monopoly on the financial system, they [still control](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1578249) around 40% of the total assets in the Chinese financial system. The Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China all rank as among the ten [largest companies](https://www.forbes.com/global2000/#4e72f0b4335d) in the world. While the big four banks are massive, they serve do not serve the private sector well as [three quarters](http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/11/09/private-sector-accounts-25-chinese-bank-loans-yet-60-economy-cbirc-head/) of their loans are given to other state owned enterprises and suffer from high rates of non-performing loans. All of these problems aside, China’s control of the financial system allowed it to rapidly respond to the collapse of global trade after the financial crisis. In November of 2008 the Chinese government announced a [massive stimulus](https://www.economist.com/asia/2008/11/10/china-seeks-stimulation) program of $586 billion, around 7% of GDP and much more ambitious in scope than the American stimulus. While the stimulus was successful in propping up the Chinese financial system, it had unforeseen consequences for the financial system .

Chinese local governments used stimulus money to borrow massively for the construction of $2.3 trillion worth of roads, highways and other infrastructure. Local governments then packaged this debt into financial products (similar to mortgage backed securities in the United States) to sell to local investors. The Chinese government has long forced banks to keep interest rates [artificially low](https://piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/financial-repression-china), often below the rate of inflation. However, because the Chinese government was eager to revive investment, they allowed these financial products (known as wealth management and trust products) to offer much [higher yields](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-firms-load-up-on-opaque-investment-products-1516532400). Savings rapidly flowed away from traditional state owned banks, forcing them to create their own financial products. Since these financial products offer depositors higher interest rates, the banks must make loans with higher interest rates. As a result, a shadow banking system emerged where banks either made high interest loans to a capital starved private sector or to other financial entities. The shadow banking has grown at a spectacular rate, and now controls [$20 trillion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-greatest-challenge-1508137030) of assets or about 87% of GDP. To shadow banking system acts as the capillaries of the system getting money to individual private sector businesses. However, the capillaries are deeply imperfect as many of the ordinary savers investing in wealth management products are mislead into believing the products are [fully insured](https://fundselectorasia.com/report-chinas-usd435m-wealth-management-scandal-unfolding/) by the state, and financial entities have lent lent money recklessly in the assumption they would be.

It should therefore be hardly surprising that China has seen a worrying build up in debt. Chinese debt as a share of GDP has grown [from around](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/scary-statistic-chinas-debt-gdp-ratio-reached-257-percent-22824) 150% of GDP in 2009 to around 260% of GDP. Both the US and Japan had seen [debt buildup](http://planning.lfsplans.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/US-Recession-vs-Japan.pdf)before their respective financial crisis and lost decade. However, unlike the US and Japan, the government of Xi Jinping has acted aggressively to reduce the risk of a financial crisis. The increased scrutiny on the financial sector has fallen hardest on the shadow banking sector which has seen its share of [total credit](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/06/14/chinas-tighter-regulation-of-shadow-banks-begins-to-bite) decline from 45% in 2014 to under 20%. The crackdown has fallen hardest on the private sector, and it is difficult to tell whether this is because the shadow banking sector was in desperate need of reform or because of a broader ideological [disfavor ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-09-11/china-turns-to-state-companies-to-bolster-economic-growth-again)of the private sector by the current administration. Complicating an already complicated situation is Donald Trump’s trade war, which like the great financial crisis, is hitting export sectors [hard](https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/chinas-manufacturing-pmi-weighs-on-risk-sentiment-early-on-545169). The Xi administration will have to decide if it must end the current financial tightening and return to the stimulus of a decade ago.

To return to the original question, the Chinese financial system is suffering from the equivalent of high blood pressure and cholesterol. The government is changing it’s diet and taking its medicine. While the situation is worrying, a financial crisis is far from inevitable. At the same time, China has a financial sector that struggles to get capital to the private sector, the most dynamic part of of the economy, and suffers from systematic moral hazard. Continued rapid growth will likely require fundamental reform. What is certain is that China’s financial system is so large today that a sneeze, much less a heart attack, will have a profound impact on the global economy.

Uncovering all sorts of new information pertinent to not only the current disputed election, but also the 2015 election that Cambridge Analytica was involved in (that brought the APNU to power). 

We also learnt of the how this 2020 election is opening the door for US enemies to set up unfindable missile launchpads pointed at its southern flank in the Guyanese jungle, an area at this point the US doesn't watch nearly as closely.

For this episode we have  
\>> BRITTANY KAISER (Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower)  
\>> IVELAW GRIFFITH (International Institute for Strategic Studies)  
\>> MICHAEL UNBEHAUEN (US Strategic Armed Forces Commander) 

Just as an idea of what is brought up or confirmed with our experts in this episode are  


\- Cambridge Analytica working with the PPP in 2015  
\- Iranian Missiles in Guyana  
\- Hezbollah's work in the region  
\- Why most of the CA guys fled and are now working with Trump 2020  
\- Their conflict with Venezuela  
\- Russian oligarchs and merceries operating in the country.  
\- How CA riggs elections  
\- A disputed 2020 election  
\- How much Cambridge Analytica gets paid to rig an election.  
\- Unfindable missiles threatening US oil platforms in the Gulf/Caribbean   
and much more.

Guyana is an incredibly easy nation to influence geopolitically with tight political margins, a low population, and a huge amount of territory that would be impossible to search. Russia, China and Iran are all looking at Guyana at the moment as a way to threaten the US whilst Washington is distracted with Venezuela and Brazil.   
One of the experts I spoke with off-air when researching for the piece referred to this as the geopolitical equivalent of catching the ship leaving Japan for the attack on Pearl Harbour.    


I would love to get your opinions on how this may shift the balance of power in South/Central America.

This sub was absolutely great for research, so thank you to all of the people here.

The deal is more then $5 billion worth and will deliver 5 units of S400 systems. 

There was last minute hope for exemption for India from CAATSA sanctions. This has not happened. IMHO, both India and USA are in staring contest in this case. Both are nearing crucial election time and have local voters to please. 

PM Modi has taken a risk and put more skin on line here and only time will tell weather the gamble was successful or not. 

Apart from the S400 deal, PM Modi and President Putin will be signing several deals regarding nuclear energy, gas and and Frigate purchase from Russia. 

All, in all bold step for India. It will be interesting to see how trump administration will react to it. 

Official announcement of deal will be done later in the day at the joint press conference.

125,"Fake news, geopolitics and r/geopolitics",250.0,avzusp,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/avzusp/fake_news_geopolitics_and_rgeopolitics/,129.0,1551410159.0,"This is maybe old news to many, but I recently became aware of an Iranian disinformation campaign that affected r/worldnews by Iranian state media. [b] They pushed propaganda and «...frequently posted fabricated news stories to Reddit.»[a] Russian state funded trolls have also targeted reddit, which is old news. [b] Therefore, it is likely many of us here has read at least some propaganda pieces, as you probably found r/worldnews interesting before you came to r/geopolitics. Since we are over 100 000 subscribers, it would be sloppy of propagandists not to post here, but on r/Wisconsin.[b] I’m not American, but I believe to remember that it is not the biggest state in the Union.

Not that propaganda is necessarily lies, but they are skewed. Plus, if the quote I included is true, then there might, and perhaps most likely, could possibly contain some info that are outright nit true. 



 My point however, is not that this is novel, nor that most of you weren’t already aware of «fake news» and what it is. It is just that you must not take wild or provocative information at face value. 

Why some extra caution on your part is important, is because you are an actor in geopolitics and international relations as a citizen with voting rights (for those of you lucky enough to have that.) However insignificant you may be compared to the «big dogs» like politicians or business moguls; if you have the right to vote and are guaranteed the freedom of speech, you matter more than you might think. 

Just follow me on this: I believe many here are like me - above average interested in politics and international relations. Therefore, those whom you know-, trust- and like you will listen to- and value your opinion on matters (geo)political, at least to some degree. As most normal people listen to those with more knowledge about subjects than what they know themselves. Plus, if we like someone, I belive we are psycholigically conditioned to believe them more than other people. Just imagine being faced with constant scepticism, it can be in quite exhausting in the long run. This makes us not enjoy that persons company, making such traits undesirable given a couple of hundred thousands years. Or so I would believe. 

This means that you as an individual have outsized influence on public opinion and the narrative of current events. Because it is the collective opinion that drives the narrative of political events. And narratives sway elections, who can in itself influence international crises as democratic politicians think in terms of elections. Just imagine Nixon running for an imaginary third term, after somehow beating the impeachement that would have happened if he had not stepped down. Antoher example (counterfactual) is if the general mood in the world were that the Falklands were oppressed by the UK before the Argentinian invasion. Things would have gone diffferently, or at the least been more complicated.



I just thought this is worthy of some personal reflection for us geopolitics fans. Liberal democracy is quite a penetrable system with current social media technology, as recent events across Europe and the Americas has shown. Just take the help provided by Russian pro-Brexit- and pro-Trump propaganda as examples. Neither election was by a wide margin. This is not to say that those elections should have been different. I hope you know by now after reading enough geopolitics, that moral judgements about politics depends on your viewpoint. At least in most cases.

Therefore, use your power wisely, however small that power might be.





TLDR: You are most likely more interested in international politics than the average Joe. Therefore, if you are not a complete douchebag or a friendless hermit alone on a mountaintop with only stricktly lurking on reddi tas a priority, but not voting, you have a tiny amount of geopolitical power. Be critical of provocative info.

Edit:
Seeing the comments, I feel I need to be a bit clearer about what propaganda is. Maybe I shouldn’t have used that word, as it seems the whole ‘fake news narrative’ has made many people nervous and overly anxious. But, I felt it necessary because that is what it is, only in a modern form - a hybrid between news and an opinion piece. By sprinkling in some inflammatory remarks with the occasionally lie to further aggrevate people targeted by these inflammatory remarks, are how they get you.

I am not saying that all propaganda are lies or worthless, because it usually highlights legitimate grievances. It is only that the more insidious ‘propaganda’ are doing so by being supplemented with lies. The best thing to do, is just try to find counter-narratives to the ones you read, or just adopt the attitude: «this is probably correct, but that article seemed very one sided, so I’ll take that with some grains of salt.» By doing this, you will sort out the fact from fiction. Because lies about news will either reveal themselves by breaking with the narrative, or be so benign that they actually don’t matter. 

 Those in between that are actually malicious, will also reveal themselves in time, after the dust have setteled so to speak. Current events always have conflicting narratives, because they are formed by those it actually impacts. There are always more perspectives than just one. In our post-Cold War- and post unipolar age, this is more true than ever, as these actually reach you.

Social media highlights every possible perspective out there, and gives it to the people directly. This is just because of its nature, which is that it gives you what you want, even when you didn’t seek it out. (Read anout Reddit’s- or Youtube’s algorithms to ‘show you content that are interesting to you’, to understand why.) Thus, it can trap everyone quite easily compared to before. Before, very easily skillful propaganda became true because people only had that one option. Now, we have to sort out the mess for ourselves. 


To be a little dramatic here: 
Welcome to the post-modern age, where master narratives are dead and gone (i.e. A ‘universal/collective truth’). 

Read Lyotard c1970, if you want to know why, even though its a terrible read. Philosophers arent always great communicators. On a sidenote here, I think this what «god is dead» means.


Edit’s TLDR/Conclusion:
Don’t worry about every sentence or quote being a lie, just wait before you make your final judgement. Is the story/comment too fantastical, then than is what it is: a fantasy with an agenda.
Remember, cooler heads always prevail in the end.

In effect, Beijing would likely be able to achieve its goal of forcing the U.S. out of Asia.

Weakened by Joe Biden’s electoral defeat of US President Donald J. Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu risks being caught between a rock and a hard place as Jordan, the Palestine Authority and the United Arab Emirates manoeuvre for control of what is to Jews the Temple Mount and to Muslims the Haram ash-Sharif, the third most holy site in Islam.

The rivalry for control of Jerusalem’s most sensitive, emotive, contested, and potentially explosive place is occurring against the backdrop of a parallel and interlinked run-up to a competition for the succession of Mahmoud Abbas, the frail 84-year old Palestinian president.

The Jerusalem site has been administered since Israel conquered East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war by the Jordanian and Palestinian-controlled Supreme Muslim Council.

Rivalry for the religious control of the site that hosts the Al Aqsa Mosque and is where the First Jewish Temple was built by King Solomon in 957 BC involves multiple risks for Mr. Netanyahu.

Mr. Netanyahu’s inclination to back attempts by the UAE with Saudi Arabia, home to Mecca and Medina, Islam’s holiest cities, in the background, to muscle their way into the administration of the Haram ash-Sharif could complicate relations with Jordan and widen differences with the Palestine Authority.

The UAE enhanced its ability to manoeuvre by establishing diplomatic relations with Israel and rushing to forge closer ties to the country’s political, security and economic elites.

In a twist of irony, the UAE finds common ground with the Israeli settler movement and the Jewish far-right in wanting to weaken Jordanian-Palestinian control of the Haram ash-Sharif and counter [Turkish efforts](https://mideastsoccer.blogspot.com/2020/07/on-front-lines-middle-eastern-rivals.html) to stoke Palestinian nationalist and religious sentiment. The settlers and the far-right are calling for internationalization of the administration of the Haram ash-Sharif, which plays into the UAE’s hands.

“Ironically, it may be the case that calls for just such an arrangement may come from Muslim citizens of countries that have normalized their ties with Israel and find it offensive that a small group of Palestinians are attempting to ban them from visiting one of their holiest sites,” said [Josiah Rotenberg](https://www.meforum.org/61766/internationalize-the-temple-mount?utm_source=Middle+East+Forum&utm_campaign=2f55a9a4ed-MEF_Rotenberg_2020_11_12_06_15&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_086cfd423c-2f55a9a4ed-33848825&goal=0_086cfd423c-2f55a9a4ed-33848825&mc_cid=2f55a9a4ed), a member of the Board of Governors of the Middle East Forum, a Philadelphia-based right-wing think tank.

The UAE’s recognition of Israel and willingness to engage not only with businesses located in Israel’s pre-1967 borders but also those [headquartered in Israeli settlements on the occupied West Bank](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israeli-settler-delegation-visit-dubai-to-talk-business-1.9303430?utm_source=smartfocus&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=daily-brief&utm_content=5035445) and invest in a [technology park in East Jerusalem](https://www.makorrishon.co.il/news/272697/) has fuelled a war of words with the Palestinians and sparked incidents with Emirati visitors to the Haram ash-Sharif.

""Most of the citizens of Israel, myself included, continue to... demand that Prime Minister Netanyahu apply full sovereignty to Judea and Samaria,"" said settlement leader [Yossi Dagan](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestine-advocates-decry-israeli-settlers-visit-uae) after heading a settlers’ delegation on a visit to Dubai to discuss business opportunities. Mr. Dagan was using the biblical name of the West Bank.

The visit reinforced Palestinian assertions that the creation of diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab states prior to a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would reinforce Israeli occupation rather than open the door to the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.

The “Israeli-Emirati deal raises the concern and fear within the Jordanian Awqaf and among Palestinians, because it aims to give the UAE a new role inside al-Aqsa,” said former Palestinian minister of Jerusalem affairs [Khaled Abu Arafa](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-uae-exploiting-al-aqsa-market-israel-normalisation), referring to the Supreme Muslim Council.

[Muhammad Hussei](https://mideastsoccer.blogspot.com/2020/09/uae-recognition-of-israel-dents-emirati.html)n, the grand mufti of Jerusalem, didn’t need Mr. Dagan’s statement to come to that conclusion.

Resigning in protest from an Emirati clerical group established to project the UAE as a beacon of moderate Islam immediately after the announcement of UAE-Israel relations, Mr. Hussein banned Muslims from the Emirates from visiting and praying at Al-Aqsa Mosque.

An Emirati business delegation visiting Israel last month was verbally assaulted and told to go home by Palestinian worshippers when they went to pray at the mosque.

[Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shatiyyeh](https://www.timesofisrael.com/emirati-economic-delegation-quietly-visits-israel-is-accosted-on-temple-mount/) scolded the Emiratis, saying that “one ought to enter the gates of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque by way of its owners, rather than through the gates of the occupation.”

Responding on Twitter, [Laith al-Awadhi](https://twitter.com/lailaalawadhii/status/1318097416260812801), an Emirati national, retorted: “We will visit Al-Aqsa because it does not belong to you, it belongs to all Muslims.”

Saudi lawyer and writer [Abdel Rahman al-Lahim](https://twitter.com/allahim/status/1318636550436118528) chipped in arguing that ""it is very important for the Emiratis and Bahrainis to discuss with Israel ways of liberating Al-Aqsa Mosque from Palestinian thugs in order to protect visitors from Palestinian thuggery.""

Mr. Abbas, the Palestinian president, has slowed down a [reconciliation](https://www.timesofisrael.com/bidens-victory-prompts-great-expectations-in-ramallah-quite-possibly-too-great/) between his Fatah movement and Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip, in anticipation of a more empathetic policy by an incoming Biden administration.

Mr. Abbas broke off relations with the United States after Mr. Trump produced an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that endorsed annexation, recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and cut off funding for the Palestinians.

Palestinian officials suspect the UAE, backed by Israel, of positioning [Mohammed Dahlan](https://newlinesmag.com/argument/the-talented-mr-dahlan/), an Abu Dhabi-based former Palestinian security chief with close ties to Emirati Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed as well as US officials, as a potential successor to Mr. Abbas.

Mr. Abbas could be disappointed by the degree to which a Biden administration may reverse Mr. Trump’s policy and find that it may not oppose broadening the administration of the Haram ash-Sharif.

In an interview with [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/biden-aide-on-uae-f-35-sale-only-israel-was-meant-to-have-those-jets-in-region/), Anthony (Tony) Blinken, Mr. Biden’s top foreign policy advisor and a former senior official under President Barak Obama, signalled that Mr. Biden would, in contrast to Mr. Trump, oppose Israeli efforts to annex parts of the West Bank and could adopt a more critical attitude towards expansion of existing Israeli settlements.

It would likely be a position endorsed by the UAE despite the Emirates’ engagement with the settlers.

Mr. Blinken insisted that a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was the “only way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state and also to fulfil the Palestinian right to a state of their own.”

With both Israel and the Palestinians “far from a place where they’re ready to engage on negotiations or final status talks” Mr. Blinken said that a Biden administration would seek to ensure that “neither side takes additional unilateral steps that make the prospect of two states even more distant or closing it entirely.”

The Biden administration could well see broadening of the governance of Haram ash-Sharif as one way of achieving that goal.

144,Al Jazeera Head to Head with Erik Prince,224.0,as55ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/as55ss/al_jazeera_head_to_head_with_erik_prince/,33.0,1550542395.0,"This event was hosted tonight(18 Feb, 2019) by Al Jazeera at Oxford Union. Whilst they told us in the audience that this would go on air sometime around early March, I thought that I would just write down some interesting things Erik said whilst it is still fresh in my mind or in case the televised version is edited.

1.	Erik was asked quite a few questions regarding his hearing at the House of Representatives. According to the transcript, Erik denied involvement. Erik was asked in the event about his meeting with Don Jr., George Nader, and a campaign manager at the Trump Tower which he admitted did happen, and when asked why he denied any involvement in the hearing, he said that the transcript got it wrong and that he did tell the house. This was repeated quite a few times.
2.	When asked about the wall and why he setup a GoFundme despite Trump saying that Mexico will pay for the wall, Erik said that the ‘chapter has not been written’ and said that Mexico will pay for a the wall/a portion. He said that the GoFundme was for landowners near the border who are fed up with cartel activities etc. So that they can build a wall.
3.	When asked about the Nisour square incident and a nine year old and his mother being killed in the incident, Erik talked about an incident in the US(Can’t remember what state) in which a mother was killed by police after being suspected to be a terrorist, only for her baby to be found in the car. Moreover, Erik said that the situation during incident was tense and claimed that there was a car bomb that went off 5 minutes prior to the incident and that he had a tip off about a ‘White Kia’. When asked about whether he was regretful/remorseful, Erik seemed to avoid the question before saying ‘In hindsight, yes.’ And also saying that he compensated the families of victims and met some of them. Erik also said that terrorists are dressed like civilians and Blackwater could not tell them apart.
4.	As many of you may know, Erik sold Blackwater and founded Frontier Services Group(FSG) which has a contract with the Chinese government. When asked about a press release by FSG saying that FSG were building a training camp and military equipment in XinJiang, China which would be completed around now, Erik first said there must’ve been a mistake in the translation from Chinese to English. When told that it was a press release by FSG themselves in English and under the name of Erik, he denied any involvement and said that FSG had zero involvement in XinJiang. He then said that FSG did medivac and grocery deliveries from countries like South Africa to the Congo for example.
5.	Erik also said that having a contract with the Chinese government and potentially working with the US government is not a problem as ‘important trading allies would not want to fight a war’. When asked about Chinese shareholders in FSG, Erik said he did not know whether it was a majority, but said there were a lot before saying that the company is publicly floated so he does not know the numbers.
6.	Erik said one thing he regrets the most is not pushing for the use of cameras more. He said that all private contracts(Private clients) of Blackwater and his other companies have used cameras to prevent any issues as he says the camera is an unbiased third party. He said the US government didn’t like them filming so they never used any. He then said that in private contracts they would use armoured civilian cars as ‘you can’t shoot what you can’t see’, but had to use black suburbans for government missions in preset routes which he claimed were more prone to being ambushed, so they had to drive ‘more aggressively’.
7.	Erik also denied any involvement with the Russian government despite meeting a Russian oligarch(can’t remember name)who was said to be a mouthpiece of Putin and George Nader in the Seychelles. When asked about why he flew to the Seychelles, he said that executives tend to fly to where investors want to meet them and that it was to meet George Nader. The meeting with the oligarch was only ‘over a glass of whiskey’ and he says that that doesn’t take long for him to finish.

This sort of red-line drawn by Trump is already being tested, and there's a small number of options.

1. Military Action- whether it be targeted strikes on nuclear facilities or ICBMs, any military action on NK risk millions of lives, given NK has loads of artillery pointed directly at Seoul (pop. ~ 10M). It seems incredibly unlikely that strikes could be coordinated to eliminate both nuclear threats and any present danger to our allies in South Korea.

2. More tough talk, no action- this would be a major walk back on President Trump's statement from earlier, and a very weak political move that hurts his credibility within his base, as well as his international image as a dominant leader. Additionally, NK would continue to make threats and build its nuclear program, but probably not ever strike first given the calamitous repercussions to the NK homeland. 

3. Chinese intervention- If executed correctly, its possible that Trump could use this increase in tensions to force China to intervene and get NK to abandon its nuclear program. It's obvious that NK economy is dependent on China, and it's also obvious that China would side with us in this situation (2016 US-China 2way trade ~580B vs <10B w NK). If China feels like a nuclear crisis is on the horizon, it's hard to imagine they'd allow it.

The last one is the real geopolitical question, the first two are just there to help me with context:

1) First and foremost, I’ve seen the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria described as democratic and libertarian socialist; how closely does it live up to those classifications in practice? Which services are provided by the Administration authorities and which are still coming from the Syrian government? Additionally, can you speak to the sincerity of their secular values and gender and ethnic equality?

2) Along similar lines, how much of a problem is ‘Kurdification’ (meaning the erasure of other ethnic identities in favor of the Kurdish majority/plurality) in this area?

3) Lastly, and this is the real geopolitical question, is why, after a long history of anti-Kurdish persecution in Syria, does the Administration only seek autonomy within Syria and not independence? Is it because they lack the strength and/or foreign support, or some other reason? I understand Donald Trump’s decision to remove US troops from the region gave Erdogan the chance to move into SDP territory with impunity. What’s Turkey’s long term goal there (I also understand they’re trying to snuff out the Kurdish ‘terror’ threat in the short term)? Does the animosity between Turkey and the Kurds primarily stem from Kurdish land claims in Turkey?

It’s a lot of questions, so I apologize for the wall of text. I know I also haven’t included any sources here; this is only what I recall from reading the news over several years, please correct me if any of these questions are incorrect in their premise.

While the US certainly doesn’t ‘need’ Russia, it would surely be in America’s interest to not have them as an adversary while they try to manage China’s rise.

From my understanding of it is that the Zapatistas are attempting to avoid the same type of marginalization the people of Mexico experienced from Spanish colonization with the implementation of global free-trade agreements. I really do not understand their resistance to things like NAFTA, if free trade is meant to improve economics globally, and why the Zapatistas feel compelled to protect the Mexican people from its likeness. They are literally calling NAFTA and attempt at recolonizing Mexico. If so who is recolonizing whom? Is this a valid argument in any other part of the world, and where for example?

International condemnation from, of all places, even [Iran](https://www.france24.com/en/20190424-iran-condemns-trump-silence-saudi-mass-execution) and others has followed. 

Events such as these reinvigorate calls for powerful nations to hold countries like Saudi Arabia to account for their wanton human rights violations.  After all, is international political and economic leverage, not vague notions of human rights, that motivate bad actors to reform.  

Wealthy and influential states with lucrative trade relationships and strong militaries have the ability to force reform.  For example, the United States has a 45.6 billion dollar [trade relationship](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/middle-east/north-africa/saudi-arabia) with Saudi Arabia. 

This mass killing comes in the context of Donald Trump's [$110 billion dollar weapons deal](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/politics/trump-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-arms-deal-sanctions/index.html) with Saudi Arabia, which has left [American fingerprints](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/world/middleeast/yemen-us-saudi-civilian-war.html) on the bodies of droves of civilians who have been killed by the Saudi regime in its reckless war efforts in Yemen.  

One of those executed by beheading by Saudi Arabia was an 18 year old boy, who was going to study at Western Michigan University after he was [tortured](https://www.freep.com/story/news/education/2019/04/23/saudi-arabia-beheadings-executions-mujtaba-al-sweikat/3552679002/) in connection with his attending a pro-democracy rally in the midst of the Arab Spring.  He was executed on inflated charges after a forced confession. 

There is no due process in Saudi Arabia.  There is no rule of law.  While the Saudi Government has speciously claimed that the [executions were of ""terrorism"" suspects](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-execution-un/un-rights-boss-condemns-saudi-arabia-beheading-37-men-idUSKCN1S01CA), the objective reality is that Saudi Arabia is engaged in mass executions of political dissidents after show trials in which confessions are extracted by torture.   Their crimes included supporting democracy and women's rights.

187,My thoughts on North Korea's nuclear ambitions and the limits of US and Chinese influence,162.0,65o0zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/65o0zu/my_thoughts_on_north_koreas_nuclear_ambitions_and/,62.0,1492327884.0,"So, we all know what's been happening with North Korea in the last few days, and the statements which the US and China have been making on the matter. On this sub, and reddit overall, some threads have popped up asking why North Korea wants nukes or why they're so crazy or why they hate the US so much (or something like that). 

I thought I'd give my two cents on this matter as well. While reading this, please keep in mind that I don't have any sympathy for North Korea and obviously have no desire for them to acquire nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles and also view much of their actions as destabilizing, but to get to the core of the matter we need to treat North Korea's actions and beliefs in a detached manner.

--------------------------------

Much of the discussion have revolved around what can be done to prevent NK from getting nukes, short of military force. US exercises of deterrence and Chinese influence and sanctions are often cited along the lines of what may help to prevent NK from testing a nuke or a missile and keep fatty Kim from being too crazy, and eventually to get NK to abandon their nuclear ambitions overall one day, peacefully.

Unfortunately, I believe such a prospect is unlikely, if we take a step back and consider why North Korea actually wants nukes. 

Is it because North Korea wants to have the ability to strike the US or Japan because Kim and his associates have brain washed themselves into hating them? Is it because North Korea wants nukes to hold the world to nuclear ransom? Is it because North Korea wants to have some way of taking over South Korea? 

I think all of those are possible, but in the eyes of Kim, I believe those are all vastly smaller secondary reasons compared to the primary reason, which I think most media and geopolitical discourse does not sufficiently cover.

And I believe that reason is self preservation. Fear. 

During the Cold War, prior to the USSR's dissolution, NK was effectively under the protection of the USSR, not only economically but to a degree militarily. NK knew it's survival was partly guaranteed by the strength of the USSR-US geopolitical struggle.

But between the early 1990s to the 2000s, two significant geopolitical events occurred, related to NK's self perceived security.

* First was the significant dissolution of NK's sense of diplomatic and geopolitical support and security, due to the dissolution of the USSR (though the USSR had begun to wind down their relationship with NK by the late Cold War anyway), but also due to China's significant economic re-orientation and integration with the rest of the world, leaving NK very diplomatically and geopolitically isolated. In the span of under a decade, NK realized it was basically alone, facing an economically and technologically powerful South Korea with the backing and support of the US, not to mention other allies like Japan, and even more distant countries like Australia, UK and New Zealand. 

* Secondly, was the US and the west's wielding of significant military power to conduct interventions, invasions, and regime change in a number of nations in the post Cold War era. The 2003 invasion of Iraq being probably one of the most primary examples, but the first Gulf War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the subsequent events in that country probably shook NK's government and then Kim Jong Il quite substantially. More recent events like the coalition against Libya, and the US stance towards countries like Iran have probably caused such a fear to take a more permanent hold of the younger, current Kim. 

I believe that those two changes put together, along with the many decade long mutual animosity between NK with the US+SK, created a sense of significant fear in the Kim government that they would effectively be ""next"". Being listed on GWB's modern ""axis of evil"" in 2002 definitely did not help their sense of security. 

I believe the Kim government believed their only way of attaining security for themselves that they could guarantee for themselves, against a foe far more powerful than themselves -- i.e.: the US -- was by having nukes.

What resulted from 2006 when NK conducted its first nuclear test, was a self feeding circle where the US and its allies in SK and Japan have conducted very significant military exercises on or near the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea provocations whether they are nuclear tests or missile tests, or things like sinking a SK corvette or shelling a SK village. NK in turn views those exercises as dress rehearsals for decapitation strikes against Kim and his cronies as well as regime change against NK akin to what the US has done quite successfully in quite a number of times over the last few decades around the world, thus further accelerating their nuclear ambitions.

The key take away, I think, is that NK and Kim likely sees their nukes and the ability to launch them to the continental US as a vital requirement for their very survival. No one wants them to get nukes, whether it's the US, China, SK, Japan, Russia, or whomever. But NK really, really, really wants them and from their point of view they need them to survive.

From there, I think it becomes obvious to see why the current policy vectors of the US and China will not stop NK's goal for nukes. 

* For the US, the primary policy to NK's nukes is basically via high profile military displays with allies. Sanctions, whether it's from US and its allies or via UN have little to no effect anymore, so the last card to repeatedly play is via military actions to deter NK from acting up too much and to try to dissuade NK from further nuclear testing. Of course, there have been reports that the US have been using cyber warfare to sabotage NK's missile tests, and I consider that to be very likely and credible. But none of these actions produce a policy that are able to dissuade NK from developing nukes, and if anything they are likely to further strengthen Kim's siege mentality and strengthen their determination to develop nukes. Cyber warfare will put NK's missiles back years and years, but they will likely get there eventually, because their resolve will remain due to their fundamental fear for their own survival.

* For China, it's a bit more complicated because obviously everyone knows not only China's actions are limited due to the risk of a NK collapse causing a flood of refugees into its borders, but also because China fears the geopolitical consequence of a NK collapse where they may lose a vital buffer against the US allied South Korea and may end up facing US ground forces across the Yalu, which of course was the whole reason why China got into the original Korean War to begin with. But, on top of all of that, I believe even if China further cracked down on trade with North Korea and applying political pressure North Korea as the US and Trump has wished, that would not produce the desired result of getting NK to stop its nuclear and missile programmes, partly because China already lacks any substantial political influence over NK since about the late 2000s, but also because it would further show them that China cannot be counted on as even a vague security guarantee and they would seek nukes even more to guarantee their own survival against the US. A very real possibility that China needs to face as well, is if China economically punishes NK too much then NK may end up even pointing a few of its nukes towards China as well if they feel China has turned on them. 

-----------------------------------

So, I think a peaceful resolution to North Korea's nuclear ambitions is very unlikely. That's because the primary fundamental rationale behind NK's nuclear ambition is to preserve its own survival due to their perception of existential threat from the US -- their requirement for nukes is to achieve one of deterrence (though I admit using that word for North Korea who seem so cartoonishly evil and unstable is a little bit strange to type). 

The only way for NK to relinquish its nukes willingly and peacefully, in my opinion, is if there were some sort of grand bargain where NK is 110% sure that the US would not threaten them and more importantly if NK did not perceive the US would **ever** be a threat to them.

But obviously such an arrangement is geopolitically ridiculous, as the North's requirements for such an arrangement will obviously not be acceptable to the US for a whole multitude of reasons and likely involve substantial reduction if not total withdrawal of US forces in Northeast Asia if not the whole of East Asia, and even then it probably would not be enough for NK because they would see the US's ability to easily redeploy back into theatre via naval and airlift as a big threat. The US, for its part, would rightly see any such action as giving up on allies like SK and Japan, as well as opening SK up to attack by the North, and may likely feel NK won't hold its end of the bargain, not to mention the associated loss of geopolitical influence in a key region which its military assets there help to provide, US geopolitical credibility worldwide etc, and the list just goes on and on.

(And to be frank, the very notion of NK and the US sitting down at the table with each other as anything like equals is likely anathema to anyone and everyone in the US government.)

Anyway, these are my thoughts on the matter. A few of the details here or there might be challenged or debatable, but I believe the fundamental premise of NK's requirement for nukes (survival/sense of existential threat from the US), and the conclusion derived from that premise (current US and China policy vectors being ineffective in both the short term and long term) as being sound and stable.",geopolitics,Trump

I am going to attempt to bring up a bit more nuance with regard to this fairly complex issue.

Everyone here thinks China's leverage is cheap manufacturing, but the reality is that export makes up for [17%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/256591/share-of-chinas-exports-in-gross-domestic-product/) of China's GDP and has been decreasing for a while now. 
[China's wage growth](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/wages) is making it more expensive than [even some EU countries](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2017/08/16/china-wage-levels-equal-to-or-surpass-parts-of-europe/#49f84dd83e7f).

These days China has leverage because their consumers bought [$43B worth of iStuff](https://www.statista.com/chart/13246/apple-china-revenue/) from Apple last year, bought [more cars from GM than any other country](https://www.statista.com/statistics/304367/vehicle-sales-of-general-motors-by-country/), including the U.S., and drank enough overpriced latte from Starbucks in 2019 to be their 2nd largest market and is responsible for [most of Starbuck's revenue growth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/04/29/starbucks-to-continue-growth-with-focus-on-china-and-adding-new-stores/#2a6331f31b64). Intel sold [$20B of computer chips](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263560/net-revenue-of-intel-by-region-since-2006/) to the Chinese in 2019 and [25% of Nvidia's revenue comes from China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/01/07/after-growing-almost-70-over-the-last-2-years-why-is-nvidias-revenue-expected-to-grow-only-4-by-2021/#5ce246b779b8). 

I'm pretty sure when it comes to the ""cut your own nose to spite face"" style trade war, Trump would be alone at it. In the end this would just benefit all of U.S competitors, like when China decided to [buy Airbus](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-xi-chew-over-trade-deal-china-buys-300-airbus-n987906) and cancelled their Boeing orders. 

This is just U.S backing off from a huge market when no one else will. There is indeed outrage but we haven't seen other countries translate that into strong economic actions (this can be both due to economic needs or lacking leadership by the U.S) . 

Another point in China’s manufacturing advantage is that manufacturing supply chains in a capitalist markets are extremely complex logistical operations that requires a lot of different parts of the puzzle to fit well together like availability of low cost skilled labour, quality infrastructure and capital.

China’s intricate networks of factories, suppliers, logistics services and transportation infrastructure is nearly impossible to duplicate in any other part of the world. Reproducing the kind of supply chains, marketing access and existing contacts that have been built up by small and medium-sized manufacturers in China’s industrial cities is near impossible. China's factories have also spent decades competing against each other, trimming costs, streamlining production and honing the efficiency of transportation.

As the tim cook said about why does apple manufactures in china, ""The number one reason why we like to be in China is the people. China has extraordinary skills. China has moved into very advanced manufacturing, so you find in China the intersection of craftsman kind of skill, and sophisticated robotics and the computer science world. That intersection, which is very rare to find anywhere, that kind of skill, is very important to our business because of the precision and quality level that we like. The number one attraction is the quality of the people.

When you think about AirPods as a user, you might think it couldn't be that hard because it's really small. The AirPods have several hundred components in them, and the level of precision embedded into the audio quality--without getting into really nerdy engineering--it's really hard. And it requires a level of skill that's extremely high.

We want to make things in the scale of hundreds of millions, and we want the quality level of zero defects.

There's confusion about China. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I'm not sure what part of China they go to but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago. And that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view. The reason is because of the skill, and the quantity of skill in one location and the type of skill it is. And China has an abundance of skilled labor unseen elsewhere.

The products we do require really advanced tooling, and the precision that you have to have, the tooling and working with the materials that we do are state of the art. This precision tooling skill is very deep in china. In the US you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I'm not sure you could fill the room. In China you could fill multiple football fields.""

So if you want to move away these manufacturing supply chains from china to other countries then those other countries have to offer what china offers today, by let's say forcing apple to shut it's supply chains in china will not just make iPhones expensive, but iPhone won't be manufactured at all at enough quantity to meet the demand, and that will hurt American jobs and economy more because many many American companies supplies apple with other parts that go into a smartphones. It’s a serious concern how US is lagging behind in manufacturing tech and talent.

The point of trade deficit is often brought up. TD used to be a much more valid benchmark for economic relationship when countries used to produce their own products and sell to each other. It is obviously no longer true. A good example is when China exports a $1000 iPhone to the U.S., it counts as a $1000 trade deficit. However only about $100-$150 of that is manufacturing cost and were kept by the Chinese, the rest are profits that belongs to Apple and its *American* shareholders. So when some of our politicians use trade deficit as a rallying cry they fail to point out that most of that ended up being profits to American shareholders.

I think all of these are very valid points and I would like to question the future vision of U.S and how will it address this.",geopolitics,Trump

197,US foreign policy under Biden - choosing between Russia and China,147.0,jqduac,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/jqduac/us_foreign_policy_under_biden_choosing_between/,122.0,1604850586.0,"There has been good discussion ([e.g.1](https://reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5d0x8u/is_there_a_possibility_of_us_and_russia_allying/), [e.g.2](https://reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/fzneoq/what_would_it_take_for_russia_and_the_west_to/)) in this sub in the past months/year about whether/how it might be possible for Russia to ally with the West in containing China. I would like to raise the topic again as I believe it is of relevance now that Biden is set to be President.

The Obama democrats were consistent in being anti-Russia both in words and action. And it is often argued they weren't as tough on China. The Trump administration on the other hand had less negative rhetoric about Russia, but their actions weren't too soft either. The current bipartisan consensus seems to acknowledge China as the key strategic long term threat to the US.

Putin and Xi are among the very few who haven't yet congratulated Biden. Shortly before the election, there was [a Kremlin press release accusing him of spreading hate about Russia](https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-kremlin/kremlin-accuses-joe-biden-of-spreading-hatred-of-russia-with-threat-talk-idUSKBN27B13B),

I do not believe it is pragmatic for the US to have two key adversaries at the same time. Especially when one of them could be very useful in containing the other. Even more so, when said two adversaries could very well temporarily band together to make things very difficult for the US and its allies. US allies who are decision makers in the EU do not seem too keen on going too strong against Russia, besides grandstanding in public statements. They seem only slightly more inclined in going against China at the moment.

In taking on Russia, it is unlikely the US will have many allies other than Poland and the Baltics. In taking on China, it might have the support of most of China's neighbors - who, taken together, are both larger, richer and better armed than the Baltics + Poland.

It is possible that the US establishment itself has turned on China in recent months. Will Biden go against this? If he does, will he succeed? Now that the Dems are back in power, will the many Russia hawks left over from the old days get in the driver seat again? Lastly, were the Biden administration to go easy on China (vis-a-vis sanctions on tech companies, letting the Chinese have their way in their neighborhood, etc.), how does that affect the notion of China being a long term strategic threat to the US and Western values?

But let's assume for the purposes of this hypothetical scenario that all the claims are indeed true. What is the projected endgame of this posturing over Syria? What are the motives behind both the U.S. and Russia's actions, if they're both working together? 

Was the original missile strike on the first airbase merely a test to see if the U.S. could deliver on their claims of long-range precision targeting? Was it a legitimate display of force, or was there an ulterior motive? Was Trump warning Russia over Twitter an actual strategic leak of information, (by accident because Trump can't stop tweeting) or was it a deliberate warning that he can get away with because it matches his M.O. of demented ramblings, thus providing plausible deniability?

Bonus question: how is Trump tweeting our military plans to a nominally hostile country not considered treason? If I were a general planning an attack and the CiC blew it by literally telling the enemy, I'd be PISSED and file some charges for aiding and abetting... unless that was the plan all along. Can you imagine if Obama had tweeted that he was about to send troops to Pakistan to capture Bin Laden? 

Is this all just a charade? Assad got to gas some of his people at the cost of a few facilities. The U.S. gets to throw a costly  bone to its military industrial complex. Russia gets to reinforce its protector role in Syria without a loss of manpower - they get to look tough by ""standing up"" to the U.S. without actually suffering. This will certainly give them some influence in negotiating that pipeline we keep hearing about. This would mean more profits for Russian oil oligarchs, which under our hypotheses of collusion would translate into profits for Rosneft shareholders. If claims are true, this would benefit Trump's shell company with a 19% stake. The U.S. can keep dropping expensive military hardware on precision strikes to blow up some buildings that may or may not be chemical weapons factories and facilities. Given the landmark military budget this year, it's plausible to assume fiscal preparation for a profitable ""peacekeeping"" action that would lead to yet another contractor-benefiting war.

I find this very suspicious that this follows the pattern of the Iraq war. Why would a dictator knowingly use chemical weapons on their own people in risk of international retaliation, given the clear precedent of the U.S. invading on such a flimsy excuse? Why would a dictator use chemical weapons internally at all, given the availability of conventional military means (I.e. guns)? I'm struggling to think of a scenario where the strategic gain from a tactical chemical attack would outweigh the ire from the U.N. - unless the reason for using them would be to provoke such a response.

Russia's actions this election cycle can possibly be held responsible for some rather major hiccups in the American-Chinese relationship *(especially given how thin the margins were for the deciding states)*, and whether overtly or behind a the a scenes, I wonder how the Chinese elite are viewing Putin's game.

Also, I remember before 2014, that I heavily doubted a strong Russian-Chinese alliance because of their conflicting interests in Central Asia, predicting that Russia wouldn't take the ever-growing influence of China in Eurasian Union states like Khazakstan *(or proposed states, such as Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan & Mongolia)* lightly when it came at the cost of Russia influence, not to mention Russian weariness about becoming too dependent on China in general, but than of course Ukraine happened & Putin made his heavy turn to China to bolster his position against the West.

Although now, with the Trump wildcard back in play, I wonder if those aforementioned tensions will creep up again....

That said, who in the administration is orchestrating the recent moves? In the last year, we’ve seen the United States label China as an existential threat to America’s place in the world, place hundreds of billions in tariffs on the eastern power, renew and increase patrols in the South China Sea, extradite a Chinese intelligence officer from Belgium, place clauses in USMCA that forbid separate trade agreements with China, not to mention Pence’s bellicose speech calling on both parties to see China as a threat.

The small Balkan republic has been struggling for independence for over 20 years now, but everyone from the UN to Beijing is standing in their way.  Half the world all have different reasons to deny Kosovo their independence, and almost none of them are for Kosovo's benefit. 

For this episode we have

MARIJA RISTIC >> (Balkan Insight)  
BODO WEBER >>  (Democratization Policy Council)  
VESSELA TCHERNEVA >>  (European Council on Foreign Relations) 

Sitting down with our guests we go through some of the big questions we had for the region, everything from Chinas investments in Balkans, to how much influence Moscow still has in places like North Macedonia. We also wanted to look into the proposal from the Trump administration to authorize some land swaps in areas like Mitrovica to exchange some ethnic pockets, and why a small change like that is likely to open up Pandora's box for the former Yugoslav states. 

This topic came to us as a suggestion from Reddit, and we chatted with both Serbs and Kosovans for the piece but I would love to get your opinion on the future for the Kosovan republic as well. Do you think the future is with the EU, or toward to the East?

This sub was absolutely great for research, so thank you to all of the people here.

I would love your input and feedback as well.

216,Analyzing America's recent Tomahawk strike on Syria,129.0,65a23x,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/65a23x/analyzing_americas_recent_tomahawk_strike_on_syria/,48.0,1492137542.0,"Russia is claiming that ""only 23 out of 59"" Tomahawk's reached their destinations, while the U.S. military claims ""58 out of 59"" reached their intended destinations.

Russia provided no evidence of its claims. The highly-respected IHS Janes has [analyzed satellite imagery](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:e59dSxYkcagJ:www.janes.com/article/69528/analysis-satellite-imagery-refutes-russian-claims-about-tomahawk-strike+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca&client=safari) in the aftermath of the attack and concluded,  based upon damage assessment, that Moscow is lying about its claims.

A [highly-insightful article](https://jamestown.org/program/russian-air-defense-us-strike-al-shayrat/) sheds some more light on what Russian military specialists thought of the attack and summarizes their views:

> These systems are not principally designed to counter low-flying subsonic Tomahawks; their capacity to attempt this is limited to approximately 30–40 km. Colonel (retired) Mikhail Khodarenok, a defense correspondent for Gazeta.ru and an air defense specialist, notes **the Al-Shayrat airbase is located around 200 km from Latakia, which he suggests lies at the outer limit of the S-400 range: to strike a target at this range requires it to be flying at an altitude of 8–9 km. If it flies lower, the S-400’s multifunctional radar cannot see the cruise missile due to the curvature of the Earth’s surface. Similarly, the S-300V4 at Tartus has a range of around 100 km and requires a target altitude of 6–7 km. According to Air Force Colonel General (retired) Igor Maltsev, the former chief of the Main Staff in the Air Defense Troops, since Tomahawks fly at 50–60 meters above the ground, the outer effective range for the S-300V4 system would only be around 24–26 km in cross country terrain. Maltsev concluded that the S-400 and S-300V4 located in Latakia and Tartus did not have even a theoretical chance to counter the US cruise missile strike.** Moreover, to protect against a similar strike in the future, Maltsev believes Al-Shayrat would need four to five S-400 battalions, alongside a radar reconnaissance system to provide depth of detection against cruise missiles, in addition to an air regiment of Su-30SM or Su-35 fighters (Gazeta.ru, April 7).
> 
>...

> Noting the Russian defense ministry version, which places the attack between 03:42 (Moscow time) and 03:56, the author argues nearly 30 pairs of Tomahawks were fired almost simultaneously. The time interval from the lead pair to the final pair was about seven minutes, giving a total time interval of 14 minutes. **Fired from south of Crete, in the Mediterranean Sea, at a distance of 1,100 km from the Syrian coast, Russian air defense could not have detected the launches. Novichkov highlights the use of EW-18G Growler aircraft to provide electronic warfare (EW) cover for the attack, and suggests the cruise missiles could have crossed the Syrian coast close to Tartus, allowing some degree of tracking.** This would provide the Russian military with a real world lesson in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) in Syria, which can be applied elsewhere (Voyenno Promyshlennyy Kuryer, April 10).

This makes clear that it would have been very difficult for Russia to track the missiles, due to issues with distance, geography, and the use of electronic warfare by the U.S. to shield the signatures of the Tomahawks and confuse Russian radar.
 
The NYT provides the following account of the timeline associated with the decision making process of the White House:

[63 Hours: From Chemical Attack to Trump’s Strike in Syria
](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/syria-strike-trump-timeline.html)

In terms of strategy, it is quite clear that this was done for domestic consideration, something the Russians are fully aware of:

>“This strike is aimed at the U.S. domestic audience,” said Sergey Markov, a Moscow-based political analyst known for articulating views that are generally in line with Kremlin-approved orthodoxy, in an interview with VICE News. Trump, he added, “is failing to become a real president, they are blocking his policies, and he is trying to overcome the shortcomings of his presidency.”

and 

>“He’s not the not the first president to use war to deflect from a troubled domestic situation,” a scripted RT piece declared, flashing to a picture of former president Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, the woman he had an affair with.

Interestingly, Russia is becoming used to the politicization of American foreign policy. Not just with Obama's expulsion of Russian diplomats after Trump won, but also when the Obama administration did not veto a U.N.S.C resolution on Israel's settlements:


>“Lavrov warned against the impact of the U.S. domestic agenda on the Middle East Quartet and the UN Security Council,” the ministry stated. “He spotlighted harmful attempts to use these platforms for the Democrats’ and Republicans’ bickering.”

Lastly, I find Russia's claims about the Tomahawk's poor performance amusing, since they sound very similar to what the U.S. said about Russia's *own* cruise missile strikes back in October of 2015:

>[Four Russian cruise missiles fired at Syria from the Caspian Sea landed in Iran, unnamed US officials say.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34479873)

But what makes me laugh out loud at Gen Igor Konashenkov's lying is this statement he made in defence againts U.S. accusations that their cruise missiles landed in Iran:

>""Any professional knows that during these operations **we always fix the target before and after impact.** All our cruise missiles hit their target,"" said spokesman Gen Igor Konashenkov.



Huh, so if the targets are ""fixed"" why is he now claiming the Tomahawk's didn't land? Weren't they ""fixed"" as well and isn't he a ""professional"" too?

I do not claim to be an expert in these fields, but I would like to believe I know a bit more than someone who hasn't studied these subjects. My dad thinks my education has turned me into a ""brainwashed social justice warrior"" whenever I try to discuss things I have learned. 

I find I get demeaned a lot when discussing my education, especially when I am unable to answer their questions eloquently.. I.e. ""how can you say sexual assault is under reported if they don't report it?"" 

I admit to knowing what I do not know, but some people see this as a weakness instead of a strength. 

My dad is one of those people and think his observational opinion is on pair with scientific facts and consistently questions the quality of my education. 

He is in the military and raised in a prominently white area so I can understand some of his and other Republicans views, but sometimes he says things that I am unable to comprehend. 

He tells me things like the left is using Farheinheit 451 as a guide to take over the government, or that the left uses fear mongering to control the masses, and that millions of people abuse the welfare system and avoid jobs to retain unemployment. 

Some quick research disproves such opinions, but he remains steadfast and says ""well there are plenty of sources that proves what I am saying!"" 

However, I doubt these are scientific sources.

I find his and my families constant dismissal of my education has impacted me emotionally to the point where I do not want to engage in any political, economical or social conversations. 

I have done a research paper to try to understand what seems like a vast fissure between behavioral and neurological differences in Conservatives vs. Liberals, but I still find myself completely flabbergasted sometimes. 

I understand cognitive dissonance and expressions like double speak, but I don't find these to be a satisfactory explanation for a lot of conservative rhetoric. 

For example, how could someone compare Fahrenheit 451 to the liberal agenda when it is the conservatives (particularly the religious right) who want to ban books and control education? 

Or how can someone believe that millions of Americans are abusing the welfare system when study after study proves otherwise? 

I truly do not mean to be condescending, but this wedge between my family will only grow bigger as I continue my education and get a career. I do not forsee myself being able to understand my father's conclusions, or being able to have civil conversations  with die hard conservatives. 

I'm sure many people have experienced something similar since the political landscape of 2016, so, how do you deal with or try to understand such rhetoric? 

Are there theories that explain such cognitive dissonance?",Freethought,Trump

here is the text of the forward followed by the various responses received and sent.

>     It shouldn't be any simpler than this. If they want it for us, they should have it too.
>   HR 615
>   On Tuesday, the Senate health committee voted 12-11 in favor of a two-page amendment, courtesy of Republican Tom Coburn which would require all Members of Congress and their staff members to enroll in any new government-run health plan.
>
>   Congressman John Fleming has proposed an amendment that would require Congressmen and Senators to take the same health care plan that they would force on us. (Under proposed legislation  are exempt.)
>   Congressman Fleming is encouraging people to go to his Website and sign his petition.  The process is very simple, at:  http://fleming.house.gov/index.html
>
>Senator Coburn and Congressman Fleming are both physicians.  Regardless of your political beliefs, it sure seems reasonable that Congress should have exactly the same medical coverage that they impose on the rest of us.
>
>Please urge as many people as you can to do the same!

my reply:
>The public option is just that, an option. Nowhere in the proposed bill is anything that forcibly takes away anyone's existing private insurance. This mailing insinuates that that is in fact what is happening.

>Please cease disseminating false information.

>The intent and question I suggest you think about is if the public/government option it is such a great option,Congress should all sign up. That would be putting their money and health where their mouth is and would demonstrate sincerity and integrity that they are doing the best for the American people. I am watching for that and hopefully you are too.
> 
>Aunt Victoria

I have not replied to, or spoken with my aunt yet, but have received several phone calls thanking me or affirming my decision to essentially ""call her out"" in front of her ""friends"".

here is an email i received from a distant relative regarding my reply:
>Richard,
>My mom forwarded your response to me.
>Thank you for your efforts to educate people, or at least encourage them to do a little reflecting and possibly even some research before hitting the ""forward"" key. Ironically, I received this same forwarded email months ago and responded in similar vain trying to point out that the meaning of ""option"" is not synonymous with the definition of ""mandate.""
>
>See you on the 19th at the family Christmas party,
>Greg XXXXX

It would seem that my reply has been circulating around my extended family, whether they are agreeing with me or are upset someone would respond in the manner i choose to is unclear to me. However the fact that my distant uncle would thank me means that my family isnt as full of nutters as i feared.

I felt his thank you warranted a thank you in return.
>Greg,
>
>Thank you for your reply, it is encouraging to say the least. It pains me that people don't take the time to educate themselves on important subjects. What pains me more is that people feel comfortable spreading misinformation without the fear of others submitting a dissenting opinion or, god forbid, correcting them in front of their peers. The vitriol i received after sending that message was intense to say the least. However what concerned me more than anything was the demand for an apology; one to be sent not only the sender but to each recipient of my reply as well.
>
>An apology infers that a morally reprehensible act has taken place, it remains my sentiment that correcting misinformation is not an act of this sort. This then implies that the act of potentially embarrassing the sender trumps the act of telling the truth, and indeed the very value of truth. The fact that a copy of the apology was to be sent to every recipient confirms this. Needless to say, the implications of this demand are, in fact, what should be deemed morally reprehensible.
>
>It is my opinion that facts matter more than feelings; that discovering, discerning, and conveying truth is the highest goal. I refuse to accept any other notion and hence feel it is appropriate to, when necessary, perhaps make others uncomfortable in order to convey the importance of truth.
>
>Truth is derived from reality, and an attempt to ignore or misrepresent the truth is an attempt to ignore the realities of the world around us. As Ayn Rand said, ""We can evade reality, but we cannot evade the consequences of evading reality.""  I shiver when I attempt to understand the thought process behind the sort of cognitive dissonance required for the act of observing what is true, yet convincing yourself of something else. I am certain that people who intently and unabashedly spread, or encourage the spread of untruth are the most culpable when the consequences of evading reality eventually come to bear. I am also certain that utilizing deception to advance an agenda is contemptible. The more systematic and purposeful the deception, the more contemptible are the perpetrators.
>
>Truth and the reality it stems from are the axioms of my existence and will not pause when it becomes necessary to correct someone attempting to spread information that contradicts these; moreover I remain unapologetic for doing so.
>
>See you on the 19th indeed.
>
>Richard Wright

It feels good to know that there are others in my family willing to take a stand for honesty and truth. Until now i thought i was the only one who was willing to confront/debate members of my family who spew nonsensical opinions or present lies as truth. 

Hopefully this will result in a change in the family dynamic and open the door for more discussion and debate leading to critical thinking.


**TL;DR my aunt is nuts and has apparently never been confronted for her nonsense publicly. I embarrassed her in front of her target audience and she was SUPER PISSED. Then members of my family secretly thanked me.**

I know my previous post I mention in ""background reading"" were posted in conspiracy subs, but I assure you they are fact based, and only legitimate government articles, academic articles, and security organization articles are used as sources. I simply didn't know of any other subs that would take this type of geopolitical issues that amount to conspiracy seriously.

If you have any suggestions for political discussion subs that would like to discuss this material, please inform me of them.

_____________

**Background Reading:**

I've done extensive research on Russia's tactic they call Informatsionnoye Protivoborstvo, IPb, which translates to Information Confrontation, or Information War. A tactic started in the 1990's after the collapse of the USSR. Deemed ""Sixth Generation Warfare"" by Russian military. It was designed to blur the lines between war and peace.

I've wrote extensively on it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gczekd/informatsionnoye_protivoborstvo_ipb/

And the same post but further expanded to include further details and sources here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/hf2iuv/are_you_a_product_of_ipb/

In these posts I give dozens of links to government reports and security agency reports from nations all over the world, some going back over 20 years. 

In the second post I expand upon my first and include several links to news reports from nations all over the globe reporting on Russian interference in elections and sowing division among their population.

If you aren't well versed on Russian IPb, they are a good place to start.

___________

**Division of the Left:**

After further research into the rising violence and confrontations in America, I believe Russia's end goal is Civil War in America.

Russia has been caught stoking the rage in both ends of the spectrum, from Antifa to White Supremacy movements.

This report by the EU discusses how Russia is currently creating and supporting online communities pushing Antifa and far left movements by pushing and amplifying police injustice, social inequality, racial issues and questioning the legitimacy of the government.

https://www.eupoliticalreport.eu/russian-connection-in-us-riots/

________ 
**Division of the Right:**


While at the same time Russia has been supporting and reigniting far right issues and supporting groups like White Pride, Tea Party, Boogaloo movement and other far right groups.

Which this University of Washington article discusses, as well as how the goal is polarization.

https://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/examining-trolls-polarization.pdf

___________

**Russia's Plan for Donald Trump:**

Though ultimately their support for the American Far Right is greater, as they also needed to help influence the key piece to their plan, Donald Trump.

Helping influence the American public into electing Donald Trump has been the pivotal  point in their entire plan. Without the election of Donald Trump in 2016, America likely would not be in the position it is today. His instability and ego have made him the easily manipulated tool they needed to help ensure America destroys itself from the inside out. Russia is able to manipulate Donald Trump both directly, and indirectly.

They can control Donald Trump directly, by Vladmir Putin playing as his pal. As well as the large Russian debt Donald Trump carries as they bailed out his failing businesses when no bank would touch him due to his bankruptcy of his Atlantic casinos. His debt to Russia and his fondness of Vladmir Putin allow Donald Trump to be directly controlled through direct suggestions.

This foreignpolicy.com article discussing the Russian debt Donald Trump carries.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/ 

Besides the direct control they have over Donald Trump, Russia can indirectly control him as well. Largely by playing against his ego. Through online troll accounts, they can make trending posts that inflame him, causing him to lash out and become unstable. Often attacking the ""Left"" both Democrats and movements. Donald Trump is not a man lead by logic and reason, he is a man lead by his emotions, in particular his ego, which Russia has been able to weaponize against him, as well as America.

____________

**Setting the Stage and Possible Scenarios:**

I believe what were are witnessing is Russia pushing America towards Civil War come November 3rd.   

They are setting the stage for mass levels of civil unrest or rioting no matter what the outcome of the election.

If Donald Trump wins, there will be mass levels of protesting. Especially if there is any evidence of voter tampering. Donald Trump will likely feel emboldened by his win, if it occurs, that he will likely mobilize the military in order to quickly squash the riots. With the potential outcome of Civil War, even within the government/military itself.

If Donald Trump loses, he will likely blame voter fraud and claim the loss illegitimate. He will likely directly call on his supporters to take to the streets in protest, which will lead to protests from the left. Possibly leading to clashes. There is also a strong chance that Donald Trump will use his appointees within the Judicial Branch to rule the election illegitimate, which would likely lead to protests and rioting by Anti-Trump supporters.

Russia has already attempted to create race wars in America during the 2016 election cycle, they did not succeed. The stage seems set for them to succeed this time.

This article from the Michigan Journal of Race and Law discusses how Russia attempted to create a Race War in America during the 2016 election cycle.

___________

**Opinion:**

I strongly believe that Russia is in collusion with China in their attempts to dethrone America as the global leader. To what level they are working together, I don't have much evidence to support, so I can not say at this time. They are largely each other's greatest ally, bonded in their distaste of America being seen as the global leader. But I believe neither wants to trust or rely on one another, their partnership is one of necessity. Russia needs China to become globally dominant so that global sanctions against Russia can be lifted. Russia's economy is currently heavily constricted by America lead sanctions against them. China needs Russia, because Russia has the espionage experience that China simply isn't creative or ingenious enough to master on their own. China's espionage is strongly tied to surveillance, information theft, and using its wealth to bribe. Russia has mastered the art of manipulation, they understand the ego of individuals in Western nations. Something China just simply doesn't grasp well, they don't understand how the West thinks, they don't understand individuality on the level we have. Russia does. Russia knows how to exploit our beliefs, ignorances, and ultimately our egos and mind. They know how to manipulate Americans, because they have been doing it since the Cold War. It is arguably their greatest strength, and I believe we may be close to achieving their greatest accomplishment, overthrowing America.


_________

**China's Role:**

China's role in Russia's plan is simple, they see themselves as the emerging global super power of this century. It has been a plan it work for decades, and it is only accelerating. The first step was becoming the World's production powerhouse. It offered unbelievably cheap production by exploiting its workers and the environment. Capitalist Western nations could not resist in their search of ever growing profits. Hyper capitalist America was drawn in the furthest, becoming heavily reliant on cheap Chinese goods for the functioning of their society. Other nations fell for this as well, but to varying lesser degrees. 

This gave China the money they needed to move to the second stage in becoming the dominant global leader. They couldn't simply produce products designed by Western nations, they needed the ability to design and produce these products themselves. With the money the West gave China, China turned around and starting heavily funding Western institutions. Corporations, Government funded alliances, and University institutions. With these  becoming dependent on Chinese funding, they became vulnerable to Chinese bribes and data theft. China funds these institutions so that they do the research for China, and then China steals the research and intellectual property it needs to further their own research. With the end goal of China becoming completely vertically integrated in production, the ability to produce everything on its own, from the raw materials and design, to the finished product. Essentially eliminating Western countries from the process, which previously was the all important design aspect. With China producing from start to finish, it would give them an incredible amount of control over Western nations, who would be almost entirely dependent on China. The dependence on China would allow them to extract far greater profits from the West than they do now.

If you want a real world example of what China is doing, look at Amazon, which has essentially copied China's gameplan. Be unreasonably cheap by exploiting workers to centralize reliance on them, where they will then later be in the position to take full advantage of their customers.

Another key part of China's plan of becoming the new dominant global leader for this century, is their heavy investment in developing nations. Being seen as a the global leader is a pay to play scenario. Previously this role was filled by America. Which is where Russia again becomes part of China's goal. Russia helped elect Donald Trump, who views these pay to play situations as ""Bad Deals"". Donald Trump is simply too simple to understand these ""Bad Deals"" was America paying for nations to be reliant on America and retain America's global influence. Pay to play. As Donald Trump and America pulls funding from global institutions like WHO, pulls out of trade deals that would make nations reliant on America like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, as well as funding to developing nations, America is losing influence. Every time America steps back from these, China steps up. Greatly increasing it's funding to global organizations and even more so, developing countries. South America and Africa still have many developing nations. Globally speaking these two continents along with India represent the fastest growing markets. China has been investing heavily into these regions to build infrastructure, so that when they become strongly developed, they will look to China as the global leader, not America. 

Many American's tend to not take South America or Africa's development seriously. In fact, many often scoff at their importance. But their development is crucial to China's overall plan. The reason? Food. The one thing that China is currently heavily reliant on the West for, particularly America, is food. China simply doesn't have the food production to feed its 1.43 billion citizens. As it stands now, without American staple foods, China would starve. Their plan to combat this is to develop South America and Africa. Both South America and Africa have the land mass and climate to be incredibly good sources of food production. Unfortunately they are currently underdeveloped and unable to meet China's demands. Once China finishes developing these continents, they will be more than capable of supplying China with food so that it can end its reliance on America. Brazil's current destruction of their rain forest to create space for agriculture is likely evidence that my belief in this is coming true.

_________

**Conclusion/Summary:**

This was a long read, hopefully you made it this far. If you are American, hopefully you have read my views with an open mind, and carefully reviewed my sources. Hopefully it has enlightened you to what is going on in your country, who is causing it, why they are causing it, and how they are causing it. You all need to realize how you are being manipulated, and quickly change your path. There is four months until things will likely pique. If the path isn't changed, America could very well end up in Civil War, and it could even possibly trigger the Third World War. American's need to unite and realize how their government and their views are being manipulated. Vote with intention. Do not become apathetic. Get active, get informed, get involved, but do not get violent, do not get divisive. That is their goal, and it will be America's downfall if it continues. Do your part, learn about your government, at the local, state, and federal level. Don't fall for the apathy trap you're being sold that all parties are the same, they aren't. That is a lie you are told to keep you apathetic to voting. Come November 3rd, do your part. In the meantime, get involved and educate and inform others. Ignorance breeds hate, your best way to counter it is by helping your fellow Americans understand exactly what is going on. Goodluck.

Would love to hear feedback and people views on this geopolitical issue of Russia/China and the role of disinformation in the West.

**EDIT/Backstory on Putin's personal feud with Hilary Clinton:**

*Copypasta from my response to a comment about the person level politics that have influenced how this has played out*

For further backstory on why Russia and Putin is targeting America recently, and specifically Hilary Clinton previously, you have to look to Russia's Snow Revolution.

In 2011 in Russia's election, America detected what they suspected to be widespread voter fraud. Then Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, publicly remarked on this voter fraud. Which lent credibility to the internal groups within Russia who believed Putin enacted voting fraud. This kicked off a massive movement in Russia from 2011-2013 called the Snow Revolution. Which lead to the arrest and disappearance of many dissenters, political opponents, and journalists.

Vladimir Putin clearly and directly singled out Hilary Clinton and said she was responsible for this movement, and claiming she was directly responsible for supporting and funding it. Putin has a personal feud with Clinton, as he saw her as being directly responsible for the largest challenge to his power in during his reign. She was claimed to have directed a movement that saw Russia's strongman leader pushed around, by a woman. Putin could not tolerate this in public, or within the ranks of governing officials. Russia's economy is weak, and Putin must keep the image that he is a strongman with complete control of Russia, unless movements against him would build. In order to regain his image, Russia's IPb campaigns against America, but specifically the Democrats, and Hilary Clinton were put in place.

Ever since 2013, Hilary Clinton has been targeted by Russian hacking and hoaxes pushed through social media platforms. Ultimately leading up to Russian linked hacking of Clinton's emails which was a great detriment to her election campaign. Putin succeeded in interfering with Clinton's attempt to govern, much like he accused her of doing in 2011.

Some background information on the feud between Putin and Hilary Clinton.

**Tl;dr: I'm making a project to document the lies and corruption of the past 4 years for generations to come. I will do this regardless of your help, but I'd appreciate it nonetheless because it will be an ENORMOUS endeavor.**

***\*BACKGROUND...\****

I am a lifelong registered Republican who always voted R up and down the ballot.

In 2016, I was fired up by the non-establishment potential of Donald J. Trump.

Many, such as myself, felt left out to dry by the years upon years of unfair practices by the Democratic party. They were responsible for bailing out Wall Street, they increased my taxes, and they did not care about the small person I was to them.

I passed out on election night 2016 after watching Trump's chances of pulling off a victory drop to 1%. Of course, my surprise and joy over his victory the next day were as great as anyone else's.

In 2017 I found myself with more time on my hands and able to keep track of the news. It wasn't long after that I realized the mistake I made in voting for Trump.

Policy wasn't the issue, nor was lack of decency the problem (although it was). It was simply transparency, truth, and corruption that made me realize how badly we had screwed up.

After getting exactly what I wanted and then being disgusted at getting what I wanted, I was able to vote blue in 2018 and 2020. Science, logic, and truth began to win again.

I got out of the echo chamber. It took time, but I paid attention and was willing to change.

However, for me, this isn't enough.

***\*MOTIVE...\****

Some of my friends and family are stuck believing everything they've been told and refuse to see how bad (and frequent) the lies were, how much corruption the party could get away with behind Trump's distractions, and how deep the swamp thickened.

Not to mention 75 million other people.

I am beginning the Trump Project. My aim is to prevent the fascism and authoritarianism that we narrowly avoided by a few thousand votes in 2020 because the next, more competent 'Trump' can and will be able to corrupt all of America.

Historians will write unfavorably about Trump, but I'd rather write the narrative now when these events are fresh on our minds.

**I am asking for your help to:**

**1)** Compile Trump's scandals. All of them.

**2)** Gather the evidence behind them. Videos and tweets will be the most useful, of course.

**3)** Document the context behind each incident.

Any help is appreciated, but not expected.

I want to show everyone how close we were to losing our democratic republic. If only Trump were more competent, I truly believe we would have.

My wish is to prevent that in the future- for all of our sakes.",Freethought,Trump
