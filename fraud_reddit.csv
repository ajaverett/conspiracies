0,I am combing through all the Epstein files. You asked for it. Here it is. PART 2 - The next 300+ page breakdown.,15929.0,cr4tvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cr4tvy/i_am_combing_through_all_the_epstein_files_you/,815.0,1565953465.0,"Well, I didn’t get much sleep and [posting this goes against the recommendation of my doctor](https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/jeffrey-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-spotted-at-in-n-out-burger-in-first-photos-since-his-death/ “Epstein Gal pal found at IN-N-OUT reading book on Deaths of CIA Operatives”), but I finished it and just in time for Friday morning.

First, I would just like to say thank you to everyone who upvoted, shared this and gave me an award. You guys really motivated me to keep reading this stuff and broke my reddit with all the messages. Last night we reached 17th on the front page. I almost died when I saw that (not by two shots to the back of the head either just shock). So many people must have seen it and that is my biggest hope for this work. The more eyes the better. 

Second, for all of you asking, no I do not intend to kill myself by shooting myself in the back of the head twice, [strangling myself in a way more common with murder then suicide](https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php?utm_campaign=CMS%20Sharing%20Tools%20(Desktop)&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral “Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said”) , or any other way to be clear? I am a little exhausted, grossed out, stopped following a few people, broke my reddit, but not my neck thankfully in a mysterious fall, but other then that I am great.

Third, there is one section of pages, 34-90, exhibit E through K, that you might want to skip over, if you are trying to save time. I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents. Lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly, otherwise you can skip that content if you want. Personally, I would still read it. There are some names you might want.

Since many of you also keep asking, yes you can share this content. Do what ever you want with it. Copy and paste, save it, put it on your own blogs, use it for your own research, make a video out of it, make fun of it. Anything is approved. [Censorship is a issue we all have to help to overcome](https://youtu.be/wSTHgoaVtSw). The only thing I ask is if you share it please try to link back the original reddit page so people can upvote it. I don’t mind if you are looking for karma or views but the more upvotes on a single post the more we get boosted to the front page and the more eyes that will see it. If you do not want to lose it, you can bookmark it by clicking the little flag on the top right.

Finally, here are a few things to look out for:

-	Names of lawyers, associates to Epstein. 
-	Claims about Prince Andrews shady deals and friends. 
-	What the newspapers wrote at the time.
-	How Giuffre got the job at Mar-a-Lago.
-	Testimony from Fiancé at time, father and others 
Overall this dump is less salacious then the first, but I feel just as important, especially for trying to answer certain questions you guys were asking in the first post.

-	Failed to join under rule 15 because undue delay joining, undue prejudice that amendment will cause. 

Page 35-36

allegations made against him and requesting a show cause order to the attorney that have made them”. Court

intervention.

-	Motion doesn’t show why addition of “other similarly-situated victims” is now necessary to “vindicate their 
rights as well”.

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege

(Missing pages)

Page 72

-	A request that each of these attorneys list all communications with the media is facially overbroad

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to this Interrogatory because a response would cause Ms. Giuffre the incredible and undue burden of having to catalogue literally hundreds of communications that she has already produced in this case.

-	Giuffre objects because this interrogatory calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence

-	Giuffre objects to the extent that this interrogatory seeks the communications of her attorneys, any author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer, commentator, investigative journalist, photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter, stringer, or any other employee of any media organization or independent consultant

-	Ms. Giuffre is not obligated to produce anything currently in the possession of Defendant Maxwell or her attorneys.

Page 87

-	Needed to do was issue an immediate denial and that necessarily had to be short and to the point 

-	Claimed they were “obvious lies”

-	Barden goes after Giuffre credibility for not stating certain claims sooner or claiming that they have changed 

-	For example – “Yet in her joinder motion she claimed she did have sex with Prince Andrew and that the sex 
occurred in what can only be described as a very small bathtub, too small for a man of Prince Andrew’s size to 
enjoy a bath in let alone sex”

Page 88

-	Barden did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely to disseminate 
information to the media

-	purpose in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated to those media representatives was twofold. 

-	First, wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation

-	Second, intended statement to be “a shot across the bow” of the media, which I believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff’s allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own

-	intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients
Page 90

-	Continues to try to attack Giuffre’s credibility

-	Brings up Alan Dershowitz

-	Barden claims it was his opinion Giuffre was lying

Page 223

-	Q) Do you remember there being a job posting that you felt like was appropriate for Virginia or did you just go out and talk to the woman who ran the spa area on your own? 

-	A) I just talked to Angela. 

-	Q) Okay. Do you recall whether this was intended to be a full-time job? 

-	A) I don't remember if it was full time or just summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. 

-	Q) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? 

-	A) Probably from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess. 

-	Q) Is that the coolest time? 

-	A) Times of the year, yes. 

-	Q) And it's more guests that come during that period of time? 

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) And is there more staff brought on during that period of time?

Page 224

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) You saw that happen every year that you were there? 

-	A) Every year. 

-	Q) And in the summer, it's relatively dead because it's so hot? 

-	A) Basically, it closed during the summer. That's when we would kind of work on everything and then make sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you know. 

-	Q) Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired to work in, what her job title was, for example? 

-	A) I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia. That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was busy all the time. 

-	Q) I understand. 

-	A) I didn't have time to go see what she was doing. I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out. 

(Missing pages)

Page 225

-	A Where did I learn that? 

-	Q) Uh-huh. 

-	A) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. 

-	Q) When did Virginia tell you this? 

-	A) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.

-	Q I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? 

-	A) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other job

Page 226

-	Q) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein? 

-	A) Once. 

-	Q) When was that? 

-	A) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.

-	Q) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him? 

-	A) Yeah. 

-	Q) Was it later?

So let me put it to rest, once and for all: 

- Wearing seatbelts never has possible short term side effects like: blood clots, myocarditis, guillan barré, neurological issues, menstruation disorders and even death. 

- Wearing seatbelts doesn’t cause potential unknown long term side effects.

- If my seatbelt malfunctions and/or is faulty I can hold the manufacturer liable. 

- I can take off a seatbelt at a click of a button. 

- The seatbelt manufacturer and agency that approved seatbelts, did not try to hide safety data for 75 years. 

- Seatbelt manufacturers have not been convicted and haven’t paid the largest criminal fines in history for fraud, malpractice, bribery etc

4,I've researched the afterlife for nearly 10 years. I am convinced that Reptilian beings are REAL and that the tunnel of light that people see when they die is a trap.,5975.0,pyizkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pyizkn/ive_researched_the_afterlife_for_nearly_10_years/,1985.0,1633005788.0,"**Introduction**

For the last 10 years, I have been researching the nature of our reality, who or what controls our society from the shadows, and more importantly what actually happens when the physical body dies and the soul leaves the body. Do we go to heaven? Do we go to hell? Do we just cease to exist? Is there a God that takes care of us? Once you begin to realize what's actually going on and how deep the rabbit hole really goes, you will never see the world in the same way so buckle up and get ready, this is not going to be easy to swallow for most people. The whole point of this post is not to frighten you, but to present you the conclusions that I've come to in regards to what actually happens when our physical bodies die after having done what feels like endless research from every angle possible.

I have thoroughly investigated near death experiences, out-of-body experiences, astral projection experiences, past life regression hypnosis data, remote viewing data, gnosticism, ancient texts and more. I cannot say I know with absolute certainty what happens when we die, but what I do know is that all these different ways/methodologies of researching lead to the same conclusions and because of that, I believe that Earth is a prison planet and a massive farm used by various parasitic entities who are using us and have been using us as energetic food for what appears to be a very long time. I will share plenty of evidence from different sources and perspectives to make you understand how I connected all these dots and why I came to these conclusions. I promise you that the deeper you research this stuff the more you will begin to realize that this is extremely real, important, and it's possibly affecting every single one of us. All I'm asking you is to keep an open mind and to analyze the evidence yourself. 

Different sources that have nothing to do with each other indicate the same scenario, so what I'm about to explain below is the conclusion of all these sources. I listed all the sources at the end of the post. This post isn't necessarily about what one person is saying, it's about what the evidence is showing.

**Reincarnation and the white tunnel of light**

You know how anyone who's had a near death experience talks about having seen a tunnel of light appear in front of them? Or having met members of their family who had passed away? In some rare cases, even having met and spoken to who they thought was God? My research suggests that the tunnel of light which appears when we die is a trap designed to wipe the whole memory of our last incarnation and to recycle our souls into another body thus keeping us in an infinite loop here on Earth. Because of this, the overwhelming majority of people walking the Earth have total amnesia and don't remember anything about their past existences nor anything from the periods in-between their lives. If you do some research though, you will notice that there is however a small number of people world-wide who are able to recall very specific details regarding who they were, what they did for a living, where they lived in a past life, etc([evidence 1](https://youtu.be/9w2MCpzE8u0?t=60),[evidence 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcsqOBUdK28),[evidence 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La8vG4mA0is),[evidence 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ty-TdWKM0)). 

How do we know these people aren't making up their stories? There's lots of people out there who have been able to bring very solid pieces of evidence to sustain their claims and those claims can be verified([verified evidence 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnXxC-nVsJY&t=8s),[verified evidence 2](https://yogaesoteric.net/en/definite-evidence-and-maybe-even-proof-of-reincarnation/),[verified evidence 3](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/140521/lifestyle-offbeat/article/3-yr-old-recalls-past-life-murder-identifies-killer-and-locates-his/),[verified evidence 4](https://newspunch.com/scientific-breakthrough-reincarnation/),[verified evidence 5](https://infinityexplorers.com/the-reincarnation-of-shanti-devi-the-girl-who-identified-her-previous-life-family),[verified evidence 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La8vG4mA0is&ab_channel=ThingsAreChangingProductions)) which shows that reincarnation is a very real phenomenon,  despite what some of the world's religions claim to happen to the soul when a person dies. The reason these people's memories have only been partially erased and not fully erased remains unknown for now.

The reason people that went through NDE's didn't come back with their memories wiped is because unlike people who have died, they didn't end up going all the way through the tunnel of light to reach it's destination, many NDE'rs didn't enter the tunnel at all, while some have partially experienced it. All of them managed to return to their bodies and lived to tell what they experienced on the other side, hence the term 'near death experience'.

**The astral(spirit) realm, the reptilians and their agenda**

The Reptilians are found in the literature of multiple ancient cultures across the globe. Jainism and Hindu talk about the 'NAGA' whom they describe as 'half-human half-serpent deities'. The aztecs used to worship the 'Quetzalcoatl' whom they described as the ""serpent-like God"". The Hopi Indians in North America referred to a race of reptoids called the 'Sheti', translated ""Snake-Brothers"". In Africa, shamans claim to bear extensive esoteric knowledge of a race of reptilian beings called the Chitauri, whom they say control the Earth. Chinese, Korean and Japanese legends talk about a race of reptilian beings called the ""Kappa"". The Gnostics talk about the parasitic entities whom they call 'Archons' who not only use humans as an energetic food source but they also prevent our souls from leaving the material realm upon the death of our physical bodies.

[The Reptilians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEMXvjv0M2E&ab_channel=TheInternationale) are both physical and astral beings. They've been heavily involved in the manipulation of mankind for thousands of years and are responsible for setting up [the soul trap around the planet](https://humansbefree.com/2015/07/soul-catching-net-we-are-recycled-at-death-to-remain-in-the-matrix.html) with the help of extremely advanced technology. This energy grid around the planet serves multiple purposes, one of it's main purposes is to project this 'grandiose' tunnel of light in the proximity of people who have just died in order to lure their souls in. This is the same tunnel of light that so many people who've had near death experiences have reported seeing on the other side. The soul may be under the impression that the tunnel is going to take it to the Heavens or perhaps to a higher plane of existence, depending on it's level of awareness. In reality, when a soul enters the tunnel, it's memory gets wiped and the soul is put into another body here on Earth(reincarnation).  The tunnel acts as a bait and to make a good analogy, imagine a fisherman and his fishing rod: he throws in the bait which hides the hook and the fish get trapped in it when they bite. We get tricked and trapped by the tunnel of light in a similar way if we aren't aware that it is a trap. In this case, we're the fish. The Reptilians are highly intelligent, highly advanced technologically and they lack empathy which makes them dangerous. These beings see themselves as 'Gods' and humanity as their enslaved cattle.

The reason they want to keep us here is because they need to feed off of us energetically: when people go through any kind of suffering, these entities feed off of our lower frequency emotions such as fear, pain, grief, anger, jelousy, rage, anxiety, lust, because they are low vibrational beings that require low vibrational energy in order to survive. Rudolf Steiner, one of the most prolific and gifted scientists, philosophers, and esotericists of his time [explains how the Archons feed off of our fear and anxiety](https://www.shiftfrequency.com/steiner-describes-archontic-parasites/).

The majority of people living on this planet today have been continously reincarnating on this planet for thousands of years because we keep falling for the same trap when our physical bodies die. Most of us have no memories of our past existences since our memories get wiped before every reincarnation, so every time we are born on this planet we think we've just arrived for the first time with a grand purpose or mission to fulfill given to us by who we think is God. 

> ""*Our consciousness interacts with another dimension. Our physical sensors only show us a 3-dimensional universe. What exists in the higher dimensions are entities we cannot touch with our physical sensors*""  - **Bernard Carr**, professor of mathematics and astronomy who studied under Stephen Hawking and earned his doctorate at Cambridge.

When our physical bodies die or when we have an out-of-body experience, our soul goes into the astral(spirit) realm and while we can still observe what's happening on Earth but we can no longer interact with physical matter. These parasitic entities exist mainly but not exclusively in the astral plane. It's crucial that we become aware of the fact that these entities who are masters of deceit play 'God' in order to trick us into accepting reincarnation and thus having our memories wiped, convincing us that it's in our best interest to do so. 

How are they able to do that, you may ask? When we're out of our bodies the laws of physics as we know them no longer have the same effects upon us as we find ourselves in a different realm in which we are able to do things that would be impossible in the physical world. Our souls are pure energy, so in the astral/spirit realm, we can change the shape of our astral body(spirit) into anything we want by simply willing it to happen because unlike in the physical world, we can use our consciousness to manifest a different looking body in an instant when we're in the astral plane, since we are no longer affected by physical laws and limitations. We can also fly around or teleport by simply using our intention to do so. We can even go to higher vibratory realms(where the real good-hearted beings live) if our vibration is high enough.

> ""*If you want to find the secrets of the Universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration*"" - **Nikola Tesla**

If you understand that in the astral, any entity can change the shape of it's astral body into anything it wishes to, then you realize that even the most malevolent entity possible can present itself to you in a different form to trick you into thinking you're speaking to God or to your guardian angel, or even to one of the members of your family who had passed away. They do this because they know you'd put your trust in these religious figures or in the familiar faces and once they gained that trust they can easily manipulate you into doing things that are not in your best interests at all. They masquerade as 'beings of light' that emanate a fake sensation of love and peace to make you think they're the good guys who are there to guide you and to give you your next ""mission to fulfill"".

This is mentioned even in the bible:

> ""*And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light*"" - **II Corinthians 11:14**

---

**Afterlife tricks & scams**

If you don't enter the tunnel of light when your time comes, you need to be aware that these entities will present themselves to you in the form of angels/Jesus/God/saints/guides/ascended masters/guardian angels and they're going to try to convince you that you need to go back to Earth so you can pay back your ""karmic debt"" or to continue ""learning"" or that you have to go back with a ""special mission to fulfill"" which is complete bullshit but we keep falling for these scams because they tend to make sense from our narrow and pre-programmed perspectives(good luck fulfilling that ""special mission"" if you can't remember what the ""mission"" was). We put blind trust in what they say to us because of constant religious indoctrination during our lives on Earth and these beings know that.

They can't force us to reincarnate because each soul has free will, but they can pretend to be someone they're not in order to put ideas in our head that it's in our best interest to accept reincarnating back on Earth making it sound as if they are doing us a favor so that we can ""evolve"", ""learn"" or ""fix previous mistakes"" and what they're basically doing is they're using our own free will against us. The real purpose of continuous reincarnation is soul enslavement disguised as ""spiritual evolution"". [A free will decision is impossible without memory and information](https://humansarefree.com/2018/03/saying-no-to-reincarnation-and-regaining-your-freedom.html).

Because our memories are being wiped after each life time, many of us live under the illusion that we're currently living our first life on this planet and we came here to ""learn"". Learning about life on Earth and experiencing it would be useful if we didn't lose our memories after each life time. But it doesn't matter what we learn over here as long as everything gets erased after each reincarnation and we have to relearn everything from scratch over and over again in an endless loop. Earth is a prison planet camouflaged as a 'cosmic school'. This idea of a cosmic school has been going around in order to trick souls into wanting to come and stay here in order to ""learn"". This whole [matrix](http://howtoexitthematrix.com/2017/06/20/what-is-the-matrix-and-how-do-we-exit-from-it/) is designed to drain our energy, wipe our memories over and over again and keep us trapped.

Many people that went through near death experiences even recall being accompanied by a ""loving"" angel who showed them their life review. The reason the entities show us life reviews is so we can relive certain moments from our lives in which we made certain mistakes and by reliving those moments, feelings of guilt, shame and remorse are being generated inside of us, making us want to compensate for them. These beings then use these feelings against us telling us things such as: ""You have made these mistakes, you have to go back to fix this and that"". Nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes, so their emotional manipulation scam will never end if you buy into it because being human it's impossible to not make what we perceive to be humanly mistakes. [This NDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MulN1vUayvM&ab_channel=NearDeathExperiences) for example shows how one woman is shown not one **but two fake life reviews** in order to convince her to go back.

**""New Age"" believers who promote calling upon ""your"" spirit guides, guardian angels, ascended masters and religious figures for help,  are actually doing huge damage to themselves and to all of humanity and they are not even aware of it. You are everything you need to succeed. You are a powerful creator being and you don't need to give your power away to anybody**.

**How they're using your religious beliefs against you**

Religion has programmed you to believe that at the moment of your death, a spiritual judgement type of scenario will take place(the biblical Judgement) and it will be expected of you to give your authority away to these beings (God,angels,guides) letting them decide your fate, so that when your time actually does come, you won't even question these beings and what they are doing with you, instead you will simply accept whatever they ask from you because everything will seem to be going as planned, since that's what religion programmed you to believe will happen when your physical life will end.

These entities take advantage of the fact that you have been continuously conditioned to believe in an afterlife saviour who will take you to the Heavens if you're a good boy. Even if you're an atheist, when you see this ""God"" or ""Jesus"" figure right there in front of you in the astral, you may start to have second thoughts about what you thought about religion back on Earth and you will most likely end up accepting what these entities want you to do because your perception of reality can change in an instant in a shocking and surprising scenario like that. 

Religion has also given you the sense of being a guilty sinner who has to worship, obey and pray to a certain God(depending on your religion) in the hopes of afterlife salvation. The real salvation is not coming from the parasitic entities who pretend to be our creators, it is coming from ourselves. In order for this to happen, we have to become aware of what actually awaits us when we die so we can use our free will to put an end to this vicious reincarnation cycle. 

The real, powerful, infinite, creator God (who has nothing to do with any religious movement) is already within you. You are Source energy. We are the saviours we have been waiting for and we don't need to give our power away to anybody.

Think about this: if you're born somewhere in Europe/North America/South America for example, then the main religions of those areas tell you that God put you on this Earth to live your life and at the end of that life, there will be judgement. God will then decide whether you'll go to Heaven or Hell, for eternity. But, what if you're born in other areas of the world such as the Middle East? or India? or any country/region in which the main religion is either Buddhism, Hinduism or Jainism? These religions teach that after death there is reincarnation, no heaven no hell. So why is it that the place we're born in on this planet dictates a certain belief in something so important such as our existence beyond physical life? Will random luck really going to dictate what's going to happen to each one of us at the moment of our death? Will each one of us have a different afterlife fate just because we're born in different places around the world? It is all part of their game of deception, but the more you expand your awareness the easier you can see through the lies and deceit of the social and religious programming that we've all been through one way or another.

**Why is Source energy/the creator of this Universe allowing all this to happen?**

Each being in this Universe, whether malevolent or benevolent, has free will. Ask yourself: why are we humans allowed to enslave the animals here on Earth? [Why are we allowed to slaughter more than 3 billion animals on a  **daily** basis?](https://sentientmedia.org/how-many-animals-are-killed-for-food-every-day/) Why are we allowed keep animals locked up in farms and cages until the day they die? Why are we allowed to be so cruel to the other forms of life? Why? Because we, just like these entities do, have free will. From our perspective, we do these things because we need something from them which is energy in the form of physical food. We think we are entitled to do what we do because we are superior to them and because we need to survive. We perceive these things to be normal and part of life. From the perspective of the animals however, if they were aware of it, we would be their 'reptilians' since we operate just like them. But we never see ourselves that way, we don't think we're the bad guys because all we do is try to survive. The entities don't see themselves as the bad guys either since they're also trying to survive. What we do to the animals is almost exactly what these beings do to us and they need to keep us imprisoned here to feed off of us just like farmers keep their cattle locked up in farms and stables to get what they need from them.

**Evidence #1: The perspective of past life regression hypnosis** 

Calogero Grifasi is a past life regression hypnotist from Italy. He has posted thousands of past life regression sessions on youtube that explain what happens to the soul inbetween lives, how the Reptilians feed off of us energetically while we're physically on Earth and how they try to manipulate us into accepting reincarnation when we die by disguising themselves as religious figures in the astral.

I've analyzed more than 400 sessions of his with different clients from all over the world but the following sessions are one of the most significant sessions he's posted in English that you need to see for yourself:


Session 1: [**Entity masquerades as Jesus to entrap souls upon death**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mh5cGA7RgM&) - This is an investigative session on the reincarnation cycle to find out what happens to a soul inbetween lives and it shows how a soul is being deceived by astral entities to reincarnate back on Earth.

Session 2: [**This session shows how Reptilian entities interfere with us during and after our lives on Earth**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXAnbS494zM&).



Session 3: [**This session reveals stuff about alien technology and how the entities use religions in their favor and against us**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HFOecADZeM&).


Session 4: [**Another session which reveals that Earth acts as a soul reincarnation trap for anyone who decides to incarnate here which confirms the information coming from the other sources with other clients**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czqCLvn8TSw).


The information that's coming out of Calogero's sessions doesn't actually come from himself directly, as he is the person who investigates and asks the questions, the information is coming from people that are able to enter the hypnotic state of mind which are either his clients or people who enter the hypnotic state for his clients. He has posted thousands of sessions with different people from all over the world that talk about encountering the same type of entities who play 'God', 'Jesus',""angels"" that trick people into reincarnating back on Earth and having their memories completely erased. Feel free to research as many of his hypnotic sessions as you'd like, [here's his sessions in italian and spanish that are subtitled in english](https://www.youtube.com/@calogerogrifasi/search?query=_EN_). He also has other channels in other languages or subtitled in french,german,spanish,polish,romanian,russian,portuguese,etc that you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/calogerogrifasi/channels?view=49&shelf_id=62).

---

Here's an american woman who also practices past life regression hypnosis and while she has nothing to do with Calogero Grifasi, [she came to the same conclusions](https://redd.it/tbqk61) about the afterlife with her own clients.

Moreover, the work of other past life regressionists such as [William Criado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFG-j0XlDcI&ab_channel=WilliamCriado) and [Aurelio Mejia](https://www.youtube.com/c/AurelioMej%C3%ADa/videos) also reveals that the Reptilians use us as a food source and trick us into reincarnating back here when our physical bodies die (unfortunately their work is entirely in spanish but you can turn on subtitles on youtube if you don't speak or understand spanish).

There's 4-5 different past life regressionists (that I know of, there's probably more) who discovered the same thing about the afterlife after each of them worked with different clients from all over the world.

**Evidence #2: The perspective of Gnosticism & Buddhism**

The word 'Gnostic' comes from the term 'gnosi' in greek which means 'knowledge'. The Gnostics were a group of people who seeked to reveal the truth of the supreme essence of the divine, thus overthrowing false beliefs of God, society and life in general. They say that humans are divine souls trapped in the physical world and that the only way one could attain salvation from this place is not through worshiping the Demiurge(the false God of religion) but through gaining secret esoteric knowledge about who you really are, where you came from, and about how these parasitic entities operate, which will eventually set you free from this physical world in which your soul is trapped in. In the Gnostic texts, they talk about the parasitic entities whom they call 'Archons' who not only use us as an energetic food source but they also prevent our souls from leaving the material realm upon the death of our physical bodies. The Gnostic texts describe at length the manipulation of humankind by what they call non-human 'Archons' or rulers. The soul trap is also mentioned in [The Secret Book of John](https://redd.it/wdhamk), which confirms the information coming from other sources. More information about the gnostic beliefs can be found [here](https://www.worldhistory.org/Gnosticism/).

Buddhism teaches that reincarnation is an endless cycle of suffering (the wheel of Samsara) that can only be broken by achieving enlightment. In other words, we are stuck in a reincarnation cycle where we are bound to continuously suffer one way or another, life after life, until we spiritually wake up and break free from the reincarnation cycle.

**Evidence #3: The perspective of Remote Viewing**

Remote viewing or 'extra sensory perception' was developed in the 1970's by the CIA and was used for espionage purposes. Remote viewing is the ability of a human being to perceive information and imagery of remote geographical targets, regardless of time and space. While this is a natural ability, it is very hard to do without training.  [Here is a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9CbLV3t-qo&ab_channel=TechnicalIntuition) that teaches you the basics. People who effectively use remote viewing aren't special, they are simply highly trained individuals and anyone can learn how to do it. 

[Farsight Institute](https://farsight.org/index.html) has some of the best remote viewers on the planet today. Amongst many different projects, they have investigated the afterlife and the Reptilians using remote viewing techniques:

In a project called [The Death Traps](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Death_Traps_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), 3 highly trained remote viewers from the Farsight Institute were tasked to remote view what happens to the soul of a person when the psysical body dies. All 3 of them perceived the exact same scenario without communicating with each other, that the soul is confused, disoriented and ends up entering a tunnel of light which violently shocks the soul. Immediately after that, the soul no longer has the memory of who it was and where it come from. I recommend watching the whole RV project for a better understanding, not just the trailer.

In another Farsight project called [The Escape](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Escape_main_page.html), they have investigated how Earth has long been used as a prison planet. The remote viewers have been able to psychically perceive the grid that surrounds the Earth which is being used to ""zap"" souls who attempt to go through it. Again, I recommend watching the whole RV project for a better understanding, not just the trailer.

In many other remote viewing projects made by Farsight Institute such as [Area 51](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Area_51_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), [Oumuamua](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Oumuamua_and_Bird_of_Prey_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), [Zeus](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/Zeus_Farsight_Project_main_page.html), [The War In Heaven](https://farsight.org/FarsightPress/War_In_Heaven_Farsight_Project_main_page.html) among others, they have often psychically perceived these agressive, evil-looking Reptilian beings with psychopathic minds who always try to control, conquer and manipulate other beings. 

You can find free to watch and pay to watch projects made by Farsight [here](https://farsight.org/).

---

Brett Stewart, another skilled remote viewer along with his team (they have nothing to do with Farsight Institute) have also investigated the afterlife. Their afterlife project is called 'Moksha' which means ""freedom from the reincarnation cycle"" in hindu. Brett and his team have reached very similar conclusions about the afterlife which only makes the information coming from Farsight's remote viewers seem even more credible. 

Brett and the other three trained remote viewers have remote viewed their target, ""Moksha"" blindly. None of the remote viewers have communicated before or during the experiment and only shared their findings and common denominators when all the remote viewing data was already collected. [You can watch their project here](https://odysee.com/@SergeantSchultz:2/Samsara-and-Rebirth:b).

**Note**: The CIA has declassified numerous documents proving the existence and use of remote viewing:


[This CIA document is not showing anything in regards to the prison planet stuff, but I'm just sharing it to prove that the CIA have been using remote viewing since at least the 80's](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R000700070001-8.pdf).

[This declassified CIA document shows that in 1984 the government remote viewed the planet Mars 1 million years B.C and found strange looking entities there](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf).

**Evidence #4: The perspective of Robert Monroe**

Robert Monroe was the father of out-of-body experiences and astral projection. After having had out-of-body experiences for more than 30 years, Monroe discovered that our reality is used to create and harvest what he calls 'loosh' energy(emotional energy that every being produces). He claims that this universe has been enslaved for the production of loosh energy by inter-dimensional beings who see themselves as rulers and humanity as their enslaved cattle. His book [Far Journeys](https://www.amazon.com/Far-Journeys-Trilogy-Robert-Monroe/dp/0385231822) gives detailed information about loosh, [here's some references from his book](https://redd.it/te0fgs).
 Robert Monroe also claims that another source of loosh is humans’ worship of Gods.

**Note**: The CIA has declassified numerous documents proving the existence and use of astral projection and out-of-body experiences, [this being one of them](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100030004-1.pdf).

**Evidence #5: The perspective of psychedelic experiencers** 

[Many people who've done psychedelics reported a certain kind of experience indicating that this place is either a prison planet or a soul farm and that we are being farmed energetically](https://redd.it/zyzx0t), which confirms the information coming from other sources that have nothing to do with psychedelics, such as gnosticism, past life regression hypnosis data, remote viewing data and also Robert Monroe's out of body experiences and research.

---

**Evidence #6: The perspective of David Icke**

For the last 30 years, David Icke has been a full-time investigator into who and what is actually controlling our society from the shadows. David Icke believes that the universe is made up of vibrational energy and consists of an infinite number of dimensions. His vast research suggests that an inter-dimensional race of Reptilian beings have hijacked the Earth and continuously manipulate global events in order to keep humans controlled and in constant fear.

[In this video David talks about how the Reptilians control our society, why the human eye is unable to see them and how they use us as an energetic food source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFaF7NgnfCc). 

[David Icke talking about the Archons, Gnosticism & The Reptilian Agenda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzCDwGUiHBU&).

David Icke has wrote more than 20 books about how our society actually works and who runs it. His books are extremely well researched. One of his books gives detailed information about the way the Reptilians operate and how they manipulate us: [Children of the Matrix: How an Interdimentional Race Has Controlled the Planet for Thousands of Years - And Still Does](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/dp/0957630891/ref=sr_1_5?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=david+icke&qid=1608115915&s=books&sr=1-5): ""*We are born into a world controlled by unseen forces that have plagued and manipulated humanity for thousands of years*"".

**Evidence #7: The perspective of Wes Penre**

[Wes Penre](https://wespenrevideos.com/about/) is a researcher of metaphysics, the alien presence on Earth, the matrix that we find ourselves in, our human origins, and much more.

[In this article](https://battleofearth.wordpress.com/2016/09/15/article-2-the-death-trap-and-how-to-avoid-it/), Wes explains how the tunnel of light death trap works and how to avoid it. The information is very complex but extremely well researched.

Wes has provided massive amounts of information on a wide range of topics: The illuminati, the shadow government, the moon matrix, the afterlife, entity possession, reptilian manipulation, the reincarnation soul trap and much, much more. [Here is his entire work in PDF's](https://wespenre.com/7-first-to-fifth-level-of-learning-in-pdf/).

**Evidence #8: The perspective of Simon Parkes**

[Simon Parkes](https://www.simonparkes.org/about) was an elected politician in the UK who served a full term of office. He claims to have had alien experiences his entire life, including experiences with the Reptilians. He also comes from a family with a background in the secret services (Mi5 and Mi6).

[In this segment from this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6dxXAAAIp4)(listen from 1:11:47 to 1:19:57), Simon talks about the tunnel of light being a soul trap and that near death experiencers are being genuine in regards to what they've seen on the other side, but that they're not aware that it is all a trap designed to recycle their souls and wipe their memories clean.

[In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKf-S-PdA50&ab_channel=ChrisTurnerFilms), Simon talks about the fact that the system doesn't want to publicize the Reptilians because they signed an agreement with them to not be publicized and that the Reptilian race has been manipulating humanity for thousands of years.

**Evidence #9: The perspective of George Kavassilas**

Spiritual teacher and alien experiencer George Kavassilas, [talks about the false messiah that people unknowingly worship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YgK-JCkmrc) ""*there are beings who come from a very dark place who have mastered to ability to pose as beings of love and light*"". 

[George talks about the Demiurge (or the false God of religions) who pretends to be our creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQPaXJ3355g&ab_channel=GnosticInfinity).

In this podcast, George [talks about the Matrix we find ourselves in, the ""God virus"" and how people naively worship, obey and pray to the very entities that enslave and harvest our souls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMKWPxKSUgQ).

---

**Evidence #10: The perspective of Val Valerian**

Val Valerian is a former CIA agent (real name John Grace) who started writing about the soul reincarnation trap and about Earth being a prison planet in the 1990's. In one of his books he writes:

“*It is they (grey aliens) who await in the light when a human being dies. The human being is then recycled into another body and the process begins all over again… Hence the Light and Tunnel at death Trap. Scanning someone they wish to recycle as they near death, the aliens discover who the person was close to has died. They project the person(s) image in the white light tunnel and the image waves you in deeper. If you CHOOSE to follow you can be trapped and sent to another incarnation of their choice… these entities view Earth as a big farm.*” - Val Valerian

**Evidence #11: The perspective of Alex Collier**

Alex Collier claims to be in contact with an ET race from the constellation of Andromeda. According to him, ""the Draconians(reptilians) are the force behind the repression of human populations everywhere in this galaxy"". He goes into detail about that [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mEm8ovIuik&ab_channel=OysteinSvendsen). 

[In this clip, Alex Collier gives instructions on how to escape the tunnel of light soul reincarnation trap at death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GynOkYGChro&ab_channel=SoulTrapMatrix). He claims that if you ignore the tunnel of light and you say to yourself ""I wish to go home"" you will return to the dimension you came from before you came to Earth. While I personally don't think that this will work since you no longer have the memory of your old home nor the memory of the coordinates of your old home, I guess it's worth a try. But you must always have a plan b in case things don't go as planned.

Some of Alex's interviews and lectures over the years can be found [here](https://www.alexcollier.org/articles/).

Can we be 100% sure that Alex Collier has really been in contact with these beings from Andromeda? No! However, the information that he puts forward does confirm the information coming from the other sources regarding the Reptilians, the tunnel of light trap, and regarding what awaits us when we die, so I will still consider it evidence.

**Evidence #12: The perspective of Wayne Bush**

Massive research on the afterlife made by researcher Wayne Bush indicates that the white tunnel of light is luring souls into a mind-wipe reincarnation trap, how the Demiurge(false God entity) controls our society and more:

**Final words**

Waking up to the possibility that we could be living on a prison planet can be unsettling, disturbing, depressing but also enlightening, awakening and liberating. However if we are to do something about our situation, then it must be known.
 
The same information that I presented here is being confirmed by a variety of different sources which in my opinion is evidence that there's a lot of truth to this theory. I don't pretend to know the absolute truth nor am I saying that the information that I've presented you is the absolute truth. The only thing I can say is these are the conclusions I've reached about our reality and the afterlife after having researched them for many years. If anyone says that they are 100% sure, without a shadow of a doubt, about what happens when we die, then that person is a fraud in my opinion. Nobody will be able to get to the 100% absolute truth about this stuff, but what you can do is to research this topic from every angle/perspective possible so that you can put as many puzzle pieces together as you can which will allow you to have a greater understanding of who we really are, where we came from and what we're actually on this planet for, so **do not stop here. I highly encourage you to do your own research on this subject and to try to come up with your own conclusions about what awaits us when we die**. Most people only rely on what religion and the bible tells them about the afterlife and never do any individual research themselves whatsoever. Religion offers one perspective, not the full picture.

**You are an infinite, powerful creator being who will never cease to exist** but if your soul is put in a new body with no memory of your previous incarnations then that's as close to 'dying' on a soul level as you'll get because you'll be reborn as a completely new person who has to relearn everything from scratch, a new version of you who will never know the old version of you and what you were all about. So good luck in your journey to find the truth about the afterlife.",conspiracy,fraud

He was the grandson of the person responsible for assigning ammunition contracts in ww1.

His father was a Connecticut Senator who's company was dissolved by congress for trading with the nazis in ww2.

He likely was involved with the CIA and the assassination of President Kennedy (Google JFK II) at a time when the CIA had absorbed the Nazi spy apparatus (Google Operation Paperclip).

He was appointed Director of the CIA to squash the Church Commission and testified to congress that propaganda against the citizens of the US by the CIA would continue (Google Church, Commission and Operation Mockingbird).

Ran the Reagan Whitehouse and coordinated the CIA smuggling of cocaine into the US to fund an illegal war in Nicaragua.  Traded arm to Iran requiring presidential pardons for these crimes. (Google Tower Commission Report, Gary Webb, Dark Alliance).  Fire bombed portions of Panama cleaning up the drug channels.  

Bankrupted the Soviet Union creating the Oligarchy we see today in the Soviet Union  used the cia to begin the war in afganistan and created the taliban using bonds which were to come due in 2001. Hired the Bin Laden family to build military bases in Saudi arabia.   Pitted Iran against Iraq in the Iraq-Iran war.  Began the air campaign of the Iraq war on a weakened iraq.

  His son continued his father's wars with an illegal ground invasion of Iraq and Afganistan after 9/11.  Likely 9/11 was staged to destroy the records of the maturing bonds used to fund these crimes and the trillions of dollars of fraud being investigated in the pentagon.  His son was torturing, kidnapping, and killing people furthing this lawless campaign, settling scores, and cleaning up loose ends.  Guantanamo.

There is literally no visible family more politically  powerful  who have as effectively worked to promote war and undermine America's moral standing in the world than the Bush family.  4 generations of war profiterring, trading with America's enemys, drug trafficking, torture, assasinations, and operating outside of the rule of law.

But the mainstream media will maintain the media blackout of even a mention of these crimes against America and the rule of law.  It truly is impressive how they can control and shape the narrative.

One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades.

Don't bother filing for a refund, save your time and file for a charge back with your bank or credit provider.

Charge back fines equal $20-100 PER CHARGE BACK, with the more charge backs filed equaling a higher fine.

Not only do you get your money back, but you hit them where it hurts. You have an incredible once in a lifetime chance here to really hurt this organization which has a history of doing shady shit like this.

Fuck em, they chose their stance, make em regret it.

Edit: Your donation was to be used for a specific purpose and they failed to uphold their end of the agreement of the transaction. Not only are they not giving the money back, but they are giving it out where they see fit.

Edit 2 (from competitionfederal99): Specifically its called a Regulation E claim.  Your bank will alot of times refer you back to the merchant saying they can't do anything but be very specific ""this is not a valid charge and I need to file a regulation E claim""

The bank will be in violation of federal law if they do not initiate an investigation into the claim.  

There may be some loophole where what gofundme is doing is legitimately acceptable like withholding funds from a suspected terrorist organization, but they will have to pay the fee associated with the claim regardless of whether or not you get your money back.",conspiracy,fraud

The sender is Pozharskyi. The receiver is Hunter at his shady hedge fund. The text of the message is exactly what was written above or the bh tag (a hash of the body of the email) would change and break the verification. The DKIM signature timestamp was 4/17/15. That can't be spoofed.

27,Please help spread this: Chevron won't let it be published in main stream publications,2534.0,qi4nhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qi4nhi/please_help_spread_this_chevron_wont_let_it_be/,214.0,1635481695.0,"Chevron sent environmental attorney Steven Donziger to prison, in the what’s being called the first-ever case of corporate prosecution.


Steven Donziger sued Chevron for contaminating the Amazon and won. Chevron was found guilty and ordered to pay $18,000,000,000. Yesterday, Donziger went to prison, in the what’s being called the first-ever case of *corporate prosecution.*


Over three decades of drilling in the Amazon, Chevron deliberately dumped more than 16 billion gallons of toxic wastewater and 17 million gallons of crude oil into the rainforest. Chevron committed ecocide to save money—about $3 per barrel. Many experts consider it the biggest oil-related disaster in history, with the total area affected 30 times larger than the Exxon-Valdez spill. Chevron created a super-fund site in the Amazon rainforest that is estimated to be the size of Rhode Island. 


Steven Donziger visited Ecuador in 1993, where he says he saw ""what honestly looked like an apocalyptic disaster,"" including children walking barefoot down oil-covered roads and jungle lakes filled with oil. Industrial contamination caused local tribes to suffer from mouth, stomach, and uterine cancers, respiratory illnesses, along with birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages.


As an attorney, Donziger represented over 30,000 farmers and indigenous Ecuadorians in a case against Chevron and *won*. In 2011, Chevron was found guilty and ordered to pay $18 billion. Rather than accept this decision, the company vowed to fight the judgment ""until Hell freezes over, and then fight it out on the ice."" Chevron has been persecuting Steven Donziger for his involvement ever since. In an internal memo, Chevron wrote, “Our L-T [long-term] strategy is to demonize Donziger.” 


Chevron sued Donziger for 60 billion dollars, which is *the most any individual has ever been sued for in American legal history*. Over the course of ten years, armed with a legal team numbering in the thousands, the company set out to destroy Donziger. Chevron had Donziger disbarred, froze his bank accounts, slapped him with millions in fines without allowing him a jury, forced him to wear a 24h ankle monitor, imposed a lien on his home where he lives with his family, and shut down his ability to earn a living. Donziger has been under house arrest since August 2019.


Chevron has used its clout and advertising dollars to keep the story from being reported. “I’ve experienced this multiple times with media,” Donziger said. “An entity will start writing the story, spend a lot of time on it, then the story doesn’t run.” This unprecedented legal situation is happening in New York City, the hometown of the New York Times—but the paper has yet to report on the full story.


On October 27, 2021, Donziger entered federal prison for a six-month sentence. He had already spent over 800 days in house arrest, which is *four times longer than the maximum sentence allowed for this charge.* Anyone who cares about the rule of law should be appalled. It is an absolute embarrassment, to our government and to our constitution, that Steven Donziger is imprisoned on US soil.


As the title states, Chevron is in the process of executing the first-ever corporate prosecution in American history. This case sets a terrible precedent for attorneys and activists seeking to hold oil companies liable for pollution. Chevron is pursuing this case—to the benefit of the entire fossil fuel industry—to dissuade future litigation that may call them to account for their role in climate change.

EDIT 1: Chevron went after him with a civil RICO lawsuit (accusing him of racketeering) because he’s trying to force Chevron to pay the $18B judgment and follow through with the clean-up. Their “argument” is that Donziger is a fraud who just wanted to extort them for big bucks. They’ve been working hard to paint him as such in the media. Chevron sued him for $60B but then dropped the damages just weeks before because they realized it would necessitate *a jury.* In the proceeding, Judge Kaplan (who had undisclosed investments in Chevron!) ordered Donziger to turn over his computer to Chevron (with decades of client communications!) effectively violating attorney-client privilege which is *the backbone of our legal system*. He refused to comply so the judge charged him with contempt of court. US attorneys declined to pursue the charge (because it was ridiculous!) so Judge Kaplan made the exceedingly rare move to get private law firm Seward &amp;amp;amp; Kissel to prosecute him “in the name of” the US govt. Except Seward &amp;amp;amp; Kissel has Chevron as a major client. So many conflicts of interest it’s insane.


EDIT 2: Chevron wants this to go away quietly. They have done their best to suffocate this story. **Chevron does not want us to draw attention to the ecocide they deliberately committed (and were literally found guilty of!) in the Amazon. They do not want Donziger to become a household name.** They don’t want to create a martyr for the cause against Big Oil. We can foil their plans by signing the MoveOn petition below and making sure this story gets shared widely.

I disagree with the Right on a whole fuckton of things - especially re: religion and the role of government in the economy. 

I wholeheartedly supported Bernie, twice. 

And, for the record, I specifically disagreed with the stated motivations for those Trump supporters being there in the first place: trying to pressure congress into investigating voter fraud.

*With that said:*

I watched 8 hours of live footage on that day from multiple sources and I know *for a fact* that violence was brought to those protesters by people using black bloc tactics. 

I watched it happen *in real time.*

There is hours and hours of footage that has been withheld to specifically help support a narrative that was patently manufactured.

And every single time footage does arise it is quickly pulled down.

In fact, this whole ridiculous January 6th narrative has done more to make me question my side's intentions and motivations than anything else short of what the DNC did to Bernie (twice).

There is footage of cops opening gates to let people in.

There is footage of security guards *in the capitol building* smiling, holding the door open and taking selfies with the protestors *as they enter the capitol*.

There is footage of protestors entering the building and calmly walking through, waving flags and respecting property.

Ask yourself: if this ""attack"" was so bad, why, when all of these protestors were inside the building, was the capitol not ransacked, permanently defaced or specifically burned? 

The government is desperately trying to portray this as if it's some modern day Reichstag fire but it's just not true.

The most notable thing that happened inside that whole building, after hours of protesting, was that *one single woman* got shot, Nancy Pelosi got her laptop stolen and a dipshit in a Viking hat waved a flag.

Outside is outside. 

Protestors were INSIDE the building for hours and fuck all actually happened in the grand scheme of things.

The whole narrative is straight-up bullshit. Full-stop.

- Guatemala syphilis experiment: American medical research project that lasted from 1946 to 1948 and is known for its unethical experimentation on vulnerable human populations in Guatemala. The Guatemala experiments remained a largely unknown event in U.S. medical history until the early 2000s. The total study population included more than 5,500 Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, children, and psychiatric patients, about one-quarter of whom were deliberately infected with syphilis, gonorrhea, or chancroid and all of whom were enrolled in the experiments without their consent. Among the most controversial methods used was “normal exposure,” in which sex workers infected with syphilis were used to transmit the disease to unsuspecting prisoners. Approximately 1,308 soldiers, prisoners, sex workers, and psychiatric patients, ranging from age 10 to 72, were intentionally exposed to STDs during the study. Syphilis exposure occurred through inoculation of the cervix in sex workers; through injection or direct sexual contact with infected sex workers in prisoners; and through injection, inoculation (via abrasion) of the penis, cisternal puncture (the insertion of a needle below the occipital bone at the back of the skull to access cerebrospinal fluid), or oral ingestion in psychiatric patients. Exposure to gonorrhea was carried out in sex workers through cervical inoculation and in Guatemalan soldiers through sexual contact with the sex workers and sometimes through urethral inoculation. https://www.britannica.com/event/Guatemala-syphilis-experiment (http://archive.is/8OmW9)

- Tuskegee syphilis experiment an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the United States government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 622 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 431 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 169[3] did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. The men were told that the study was only going to last six months, but it actually lasted 40 years.[4] After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with penicillin even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told that they were being treated for ""bad blood"", a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. ""Bad blood""—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment (http://archive.is/xGIQp)

**Political:**

- Operation Snow White was a criminal conspiracy by the Church of Scientology during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations into and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members in more than 30 countries.[1] It was one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history,[2] with up to 5,000 covert agents.[3] This operation also exposed the Scientology plot 'Operation Freakout', because Operation Snow White was the case that initiated the U.S. government's investigation of the Church.[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White

- ""Between 1969 and 1973, the U.S. dropped half-a-million tons of bombs on Cambodia alone, killing at least 100,000 civilians. Given that Nixon had been elected on a promise to end the war in Vietnam, Kissinger believed that it wasn’t enough to place Menu in the category of 'top secret.' Absolute and total secrecy, especially from Congress, was a necessity. He had no doubt that Congress, crucial to the appropriation of funds needed to conduct specific military missions, would never approve a bombing campaign against a neutral country with which the United States wasn’t at war."" https://www.salon.com/2015/11/10/henry_kissingers_genocidal_legacy_partner/ (http://archive.is/4NMTE)

**The Government's influence in TV shows and movies:**

- Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think.

-  Over the decades, the relationship between Hollywood and the military has served the needs of both sides: Filmmakers gain access to equipment, locations, personnel and information that lend their productions authenticity, while the armed forces get some measure of control over how they're depicted. That's important not just for recruiting but also for guiding the behavior of current troops and appealing to the U.S. taxpayers who foot the bills. National CineMedia, which sells ads in movie theaters, paired the Army and 20th Century Fox for a marketing campaign designed to reach potential recruits. The campaign intercut footage from the Fox superhero movie ""X-Men: First Class"" with images of real soldiers as a voice-over intoned, ""Heroes — ordinary people who discover they can do extraordinary things."" The spots played in cinemas, and exit polls of 17- to 24-year-olds leaving the movie theater found that those who saw the ad were 25% more likely to say they would consider joining the Army. http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-military-movies-20110821 (http://archive.is/01L57)

- Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic. http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/

I have a theory about his recent divorce. As many of you may know, the economy will be having a major correction soon. Stocks could easily go down 50% or more. Bezos, being close with the CIA and the richest man in the world, probably knows this. He knows that he will lose tens of billions of dollars. So what does he want to do? Sell as much Amazon stock as possible. Because his entire net worth is in Amazon stock. But imagine if Bezos suddenly started offloading billions in Amazon shares? The stock price would crash. The entire market could crash from something that big. He could also get charged with securities fraud if he sells because he knows something will go down soon.

So what is old Jeff to do?

Follow the lead of the only executive to get away scot free after Enron collapsed. When Enron was about to collapse, all the executives sold millions of dollars of their shares. They ended up getting charged for this fraud. Except for one man. He just so happened to divorce his wife for some random stripper. Right before the collapse. A judge ordered him to sell his shares and split the proceeds with his now ex wife. So he was able to get away will it all.

My theory is that Bezos know that the stock market will soon collapse. He wants to have a way to sell off his shares without getting in trouble or alerting the public that something is wrong. So he orchestrates some high profile affair and his wife leaving him. He makes sure there is a ton of drama to keep it in the news. Then during the divorce proceedings, he is ""ordered"" to sell his stock. So nobody thinks twice.

It turns out that the person who leaked the affair story to the press was none other than the brother of the mistress. He also just happened to come out an publicly say that Bezos and his wife are't telling the truth about the divorce and that they have other reasons.

&#x200B;

So keep an eye out on this. When he starts to offload his Amazon shares, you know the collapse is imminent.

The systematic dismantling of our most inalienable rights is happening right before our eyes using methods of psychological manipulation and control. The US - which was once the bastion of freedom and the home of brave men willing to die to protect that freedom - is quickly dissolving into a fascist state, and most Americans are none the wiser.

Come this 4th of July people will still be waving flags, singing songs, and watching firework shows, determined to believe they are still free and brave because that is far easier a perceived reality to swallow than the truth.

Now more than ever we need to stand firm in reality. The truth that we are being sold into slavery by our politicians.

I have browsed this sub for a long time, but admittedly got caught up in the circus (mass psychosis) of the last couple years of political, social, civil, public health, and economic chaos. I have always had an intuitive feeling that Biden was ushered in as President by the powers that be, but went along with it because I felt that Trump was also chosen by the elite. Trump played a very important role, and now it was Biden’s turn (whether Trump was ready to go or not).

I thought, hell, might as well go along with it. Frankly, Biden’s promise of playing nice and ending COVID sounded comforting. What could he possibly do that would be so terrible? He would just remain a boring, white bread, moderately left President and not accomplish nor destroy anything significant.

Well, after yesterday’s press conference, my eyes have been completely opened. **Biden is here to oversee the fall of America as we know it.** He is here to oversee the great reset, the great awakening, whatever you want to call it. Dark times are ahead, and the powers that be have installed a puppet to mislead us, following the installation of a clown to distract us from 2016-2020.

I strongly believe that the next coming years will see great global economic, diplomatic, and societal fallout.

This includes: the worst economic crash of all time, stock market manipulation exposed, the inevitable rug pull of COVID, the public realizing that the last 2 years of their lives have been stolen from them for financial/political gain, Russia and China disturbing global sovereignty, Metaverses, cryptocurrency, and possibly much more. The economic crash will be so severe that it will be used to convince people that a great reset is NEEDED, just like 2 years of quarantines, masks, and vax were needed to stop the pandemic.

I also believe that we will continue to see the rapid cognitive decline of President Biden. I mean, I voted for the man, but yesterday’s press conference was *the single most embarrassing event I’ve ever witnessed* from the White House press floor. He was confused, delusional, misleading, out of touch, and by the end of it, there were numerous times where he was literally incoherent, unable to remember what he was saying as he was saying it.

This may or may not lead to the invocation of the 25th amendment. I’m not sure if TPTB will milk a full 4 years out of Biden or not, given Kamala’s inability to do apparently anything correct. The MSM is already turning on them both, so I’m not sure what this suggests for the impending chaos awaiting us in the next 3 years.

I have never experienced such a 180 degree revelation of my own cognitive dissonance and misinformed biases before. I feel shame, embarrassment, and anger for being conned into voting for these people. I truly believe that Biden & Harris are in place to oversee the darkest times in American history, and to divide this country further than it already is - in a completely different method than Trump’s rhetoric did.

My eyes are now open. I am now looking back at the 2020 election, the exploitation of the pandemic leading up to it, the media circus of narratives (COVID death tolls, Antifa, BLM, Proud Boys, George Floyd, Kyle Rittenhouse, presidential debates, election fraud, Jan 6th) and I see everything in a whole new perspective now. Even popular online conspiracy theory discourse all seem like orchestrated misinformation campaigns to me: Epstein, flight logs, Maxwell, Trump & Epstein, Biden sniffing kids, QAnon, Clintons, Plandemic, Bill Gates.

It's all fucking manipulated chaos and hysteria. We are living in an orchestrated sociopolitical theater, a clown circus, an amalgam of constant psyops and new world agendas. 

Why? I have absolutely no answer nor explanation. But I am seeing things that I have never seen before and I hoped to confide in this sub to share my truths.

The 61-year-old leader has not been seen in public for more than two weeks. Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said last week that Mr. Magufuli was ""healthy and working hard"". And [today](https://news.yahoo.com/tanzanias-president-john-magufuli-died-210554352.html) is reported that he died of a heart failure. 

To add some context, John Magufuli is one of the “Covid denier” heads of state from Africa.

He famously had his office submit five unlabelled samples for [testing](https://odysee.com/@TruthVault:0/Tanzanian-President-John-Magufuli---Papaya%2C-Goats-and-Cars-Oil-are-Corona-positive:a) – goat, motor oil, papaya, quail and jackfruit – and when four came back positive and one “inconclusive”, he banned the testing kits and called for an investigation into their origin and manufacture.

In the past, he has also questioned the safety and efficacy of the supposed “covid vaccines”, and has not permitted their use in Tanzania.

In the Western press Magufuli has been portrayed as “anti-science” and “populist”, but it is not fair to suggest that the health of the people of Tanzania is a low priority for the President. In fact it’s quite the opposite.

After winning his first election in 2015 he slashed government salaries (including his own) in order to increase funding for hospitals and buying AIDs medication. In 2015 he cancelled the Independence Day celebrations and used the money to launch an anti-Cholera campaign. Healthcare has been one of his administration’s top priorities, and Tanzanian life expectancy has increased every year while he has been in office.

The negative coverage of President Magufuli is a very recent phenomenon. Early in his Presidency he even received glowing write-ups from the Western press and Soros-backed think tanks, praising his reforms and calling him an “example” to other African nations.

All that changed when he spoke out about Covid being hoax.

When he was re-elected in October 2020 the standard Western accusations of “voter suppression” and “electoral fraud” appeared in the Western press which had previously reported his approval rating as high as 96%.

He is not the first African head of state to suffer such a fate in the age of Covid.

Last summer Pierre Nkurunziza, the President of Burundi, refused to play along with Covid and instructed the WHO delegation to leave his country…before dying suddenly of a “heart attack” or “suspected Covid19”. His successor immediately reversed every single one of his Covid policies, including inviting the WHO back to the country.

Does anyone else remember how this all started? Forgive me for any timeline errors about this but Trust me worth the read.   I'd love to hear others opinions and discussion on the topics below.

I would say I have been a life long conspiracy fan and could hold my own discussing any conspiracy from the moon landing, JFK, Illuminati, Bill Cooper, Atlantis, Flat earth, Hollow earth, Big foot, Aliens, Ancient aliens, Nephilim ,Giants, Niberu, Mayan calendar 2012 end of the world, Age of Aquarius, Theosophy, Maitra,  Manhattan project, Alex Jones, Area 51,  Mk ultra, Majestic 12, Project mocking bird, Gulf of Tokin, The Bushes all the way back to Prescot,  Holocaust didn’t happen, 911, Stanely Kubrick hidden messages, Obama is the antichrist,  Yes we can= thank you satan backwards, Georgia Guide stones, Denver airport, Clinton death count, Clinton Foundation, Haiti, Operation Northwoods, Satanic backmasking in music, Subliminal messages in media and Disney, Elite child abuse, Ritual sacrifice,  Skull and Bones,  Free masons, Cern, Chemtrails, Reptilian overlords from Zeta Reticuli, Moon Nazis, Pizza Gate,  I mean I literally went down every rabbit hole the internet had to offer. My Journey down started around 2003. Please forgive me if I left anything out and understand that I move forward with this with the assumption you have been down these rabbit holes as well.

Entertaining as they all were, obviously some I viewed with a healthy suspicion. Being a rational being there was only so far I was willing to go on believing without evidence which is “MY” hallmark of a conspiracy theory. (Lack of evidence) The one theme that always resonated with me the most was that the elites in one way or the other conspired to control us to a brave new world, 1984 style NWO society, with complete government control in all aspects of life.  Whether this was a result of the natural seduction of power from greedy elites or some satanic end times fulfilling prophecy Bohemian Grove shit is up to interpretation.  That just seemed obvious knowing human nature and observing the world. Whatever the motivation, anyone can see that elites conspire for control. It’s happened throughout history and hasn’t stopped to this day.

So fast forward to 2016. Head filled with all sorts of conspiracy theories, Trump enters the Presidential Race. Things in the conspiracy world heat up. Everyone hates him, Republicans, Democrats,  99% of anyone in a Governmental Position. Which if you’re conspiracy minded meant he might be onto something. To see everyone hating him while he yelled “Drain the Swamp and lock her up” encouraged, me at least, to think maybe this guy is different. People like Alex Jones were getting millions of viewers on YouTube everyday. 

Conservative outlets were being demonized by the main stream media, conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiannopoulous, Gavin McInnes, Steven Crowder and others are literally shut down from speaking at college campuses via violent protest by the antifa types. It became fashionable to label all conservatives as Fascist, Nazis and white nationalist like never before.   These tactics had the opposite desired effect (or did they?) and united conservatives through alternative media outlets.

Then came the Hillary email scandal and the wiki leaks drop of the Podesta, Clinton, and Democrat emails. Tons of pedophilia code words scattered throughout.   Pizza Gate erupts. This was all but confirmation of an elite conspiracy involving everything you’d expect.  Elites, Comet ping pong, Maria Abramovic, spirit cooking and absolute craziness. Trump gets on the Alex Jones show, while not confirming anything, solidifies the notion he was an outsider ready to expose the corruption of the elites. (To me at least but I’m sure others as well)

Pizza Gate gains more traction and youtube is filled with videos on the subject.  Supposed videos of Hillary and others involved. Main stream media could no longer ignore it and damage control kicked in.  All youtube conspiracy videos are banned, specifically Alex Jones, and the term fake news is coined and fact checking began by “official fact checkers”.  Trump is gaining in popularity and people seem to be waking up to the corruption. The screams of “lock her up” are an ever present call at his rallies. Seth Rich gets murdered and this only fuels the fire.  Ordinary people are waking up to the crazy conspiracy theories and I feel vindicated for my conspiracy minded sentiments. Trump rallies are packed and support seems to be overwhelming. The future is now and the most unexpected leader ready to confront this cabal was none other than Donald Trump.  Absolutely surreal.

No doubt in my mind that the popularity of conspiracy theories at the time and the Alex Jones appearance in particular, cemented a voting block that helped, if not single handedly put Trump in the White House. People were fed up, the manipulation of the news media was so blatantly biased and people were tired of the lies and being taxed to death to fund wars and political agendas of elites who didn’t care about them. Even if all the Pizza gate and conspiracy stuff were all lies, people were primed for a change and Trump offered it in spades.  

The Cubs win the World Series and Trump is soon after elected in an apparent landslide blindsiding all main stream media, bringing some liberal media personalities to literal tears. The draining of the swamp and exposure of the evil global cabal felt eminent. It felt like the majority of people finally saw the light and put politics aside and voted for an outsider who upset the establishment on both sides despite running as a Republican.  The NPC’s were crying in the streets, paid and unpaid, and there seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel.  

Then nothing happened. Hilary was not in jail, swamp was not drained. Given, I will admit it would take some tact and strategic maneuvering to accomplish this, with republicans and democrats against him, so I wait.  All the while democrats protesting the election results, not my President, Russian interference etc. The Main stream media behind the Democratic agenda the whole ride. Them emerges the Q-anon movement or at least this is when I came across it.  These cryptic 4chan or 8chan post fuel the faith in Trump and seem to make sense with the storm is coming because of course a storm of this magnitude could not just come out of the blue. The corruption was too embedded in our system for the election of one man to be able to end it. This was evidenced by the overwhelming mainstream media bias against Trump and his deplorable supporters. This would no doubt be a long row to hoe. 

Then came the Mueller Report and the targeting of Roger stone, Mike Flinn and other Trump supporters.  The Cabal is not going down without a fight. The left unleash their enforcers, doxing people involved with Trumps campaign, gathering at their homes, everyone who supported Trump was a Nazi white supremacist to be exposed and dealt with accordingly.  Trump rallies continue and come to a head at Charlottesville, giving the left everything they need to demonize Trump and his supporters. (false flag or not) That, along with the medias framing of Trumps immigration policies being biased against people of color and Muslims and anything else they can say to make Trump and his supporter seem like white supremacist radical backwards rednecks. 

Q-anon fanning the flames of the conspiracy minded folks with the promise of the fall of the cabal and trusting them to get the job done in due time. It all seemed to make sense at the time. As more and more time passed, the less and less Q-anon seemed creditable and nothing was happening other than the main stream Media’s relentless demonization of Trump and his supporters.

The mainstream media is at a fever pitch against Trump to the point it’s laughable. Then Harvey Weinstein happens and the #metoo movement and cancel culture explodes. Harvey Weinstein and his shenanigans encourage me that the crazy cult like elite control system was falling apart, even though it was framed as a left leaning agenda. Major censorship comes out of this taking down left and right wing people of prominence. Many actors and celebrities are accused of being involved and some of it seems to be completely justified. Not like it was surprising that Hollywood elites would “casting couch” people to give them access to opportunities for fame and financial rewards.  The Pizza gate stuff makes a resurgence with this and my conspiracy minded tendencies seem once again justified. 

Cue Jeffery Epstein. Holy shit, this is every conspiracy person's dream. Evidence of some weird sex cult shit implicating politicians, Hollywood, rich folks, royals, almost anyone who was in position to be of influence. Flight logs of pedophile island naming the who’s  who of the elites. Q-anon once again seems to be relevant. Jeffery Epstein then dies in custody of an apparent suicide. (Yeah right) And all coverage comes to a holt. Until Maxwell his girlfriend, conspirator or whatever which gave hope but quickly was swept under the rug of Trump bad, Trump supporters racist and BLM protest and riots.

At this time the whole world seemed to be rejecting the NWO with Hong Kong protesting mainland China’s rule, Brexit, Frances  yellow vest protests, all the cancel culture bs and multiculturalism was losing traction along with the exposure of Epstein and that rabbit hole. Despite what mainstream media was telling us the buzz around the world was in line with stopping the global elite agenda. Shit appeared to be hitting the fan with the common people in all countries and internet censorship grew to new heights and fact checking became the new norm for not just media figures but random twitter and facebook post. The desperate need to control the narrative was so painfully obvious there could be no mistaking what was going on. Trust in the mainstream media was at a universal all time low and there was no way they could stop it.

Then videos start coming out of China of people falling out in the streets and talk of some new virus being the cause. This was mostly speculation at the time with no one believing China’s coverage of it. Soon after Americas first case was reported in Seattle if I’m not mistaken.  Then the whole fucking world goes ape shit. It’s everywhere and it’s killing people and it's highly contagious. Hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed and the death count is rising. At least that is what they told us.  Conspiracies switch over to if this virus was man made. Did China release it on purpose or was it some type of lab accident in Wuhan, which coincidentally was also the proclaimed location of the wet market where the virus originated from.   And conveniently coverage of the global protest in Hong Kong, France, England, etc ended and lockdowns began.   15 days to stop the curve!  LOL!

Over the next couple of months people realize this virus that the mainstream media and the medical powers that be label as COVID\_19  was not what they were telling us despite rampant coverage to the contrary. This drives another wedge between Trump supporters and the left. Mask wearers and mask deniers. It also pumps up the anti---anti vaxers. Believe science! Scientist would never lie to us when it comes to something like this would they?  All I could think about was those old lucky strike cigarette ads saying Give your lungs a vacation with a fresh cigarette!  Great Flavor, 9 out of 10 Doctors agree!  Lucky Strikes are the Best!

Fast forward and BLM is burning down cities over police brutality in some cases where it seemed to have been justified. (I say that because I don’t trust media to tell me the truth and since I was not there I don’t know if it was or wasn’t) Whatever your opinion on the matter is, there is no doubt police have a dangerous job, with their life on the line and have to make decisions accordingly. Now, some of the stuff by all accounts appeared out of line and worth protesting while others were questionable if the police acted out of line. No doubt there are some bad police officers just like there are bad people everywhere. I would expect a normal distribution in the police force just as in society as a whole. Regardless of the validity of these protest being justified or not, it fueled the cancel culture mayhem and framed white folks, especially Trump supports as out right racist. The erasing of history began and historical statues all over the country were defaced and some started forcefully coming down.

After this BLM appears to have been weaponized by the left with a new protest exploding faster than you can count and cities burning, shops looted, people harassed in the streets. This progressed to whole cities rioting and police buildings were occupied and eventually sections of Seattle “roped off” into chaz or chop or whatever the fuck they were calling it. Cries of defund the police from protestors on the streets and pushed by mainstream media along with the Media pushing social distancing and mask wearing for everyone but the ""protestors"".

This is when I started to feel funny. No person in their right rational mind wants riots and chaos in their cities. No matter what the reason. Defunding the police was an asinine sentiment that I couldn’t believe anyone would get behind. The democrats and main stream media backing this was the most perplexing thing to me. Could they be this stupid? Did they not see they were pushing more and more people away from their agenda and towards Trump. Could they have really been that stupid or was this all part of the plan? I started to think maybe Trump wasn’t a political outsider but a controlled opposition player and this had all been theatrics. With Trump playing the heel. Could this be true? Of course anything is possible so I couldn’t rule it out but at the same time I wasn’t sold on the notion.

November 4th 2020 was fastly approaching, cities are burning, cries of defund the police are coming from the left and their supporting media affiliates along with social distancing orders, lockdowns, essential personnel only allowed to work. Bars and restaurants shut down along with sporting events, concerts etc. This is the new normal we are told. Get used to it. All the while people start to protest the lockdowns world wide and media coverage of this is lacking. Proving again the biased narrative of it all and the conspiratorial elite global cabal grasping for control. The only hope is another 4 years of Trump.  Biden has no enthusiasm behind him while Trump rallies are like fucking SEC tailgates. Mainstream media predicting a Biden win, a familiar feel from 2016 when everyone was saying Trump would lose. October surprise this time is Hunter Bidens laptop which is eerily similar to the pizza gate stuff from 2016 along with some foreign corruption and money. A lot of talk about it but nothing happens.   Business as usual.

Then came election day. Trump is ahead by all accounts early on the 4th. Then, mysteriously some states stop counting votes.  I watched all night long when Trump won in 2016 and no states stopped counting. WTF, this seems weird but whatever. Maybe it’s because of the covid-19 restrictions and some states are completely mail in with others expanding the rules to allow for people to vote from a distance to keep away the covid boogeyman. Ok, I get it, this is a different type of election. Then Georgia says a water main broke preventing the counting there and  halted the count until repairs are made. Ok, 2020 can’t get any weirder and I decide to go to sleep with Trump in the lead everywhere, expect the traditional blue states NY, CA Etc which were called right as the polls opened.

 I wake up and everything has changed. Trump is now trailing everywhere he had a lead. Time passes and Bidens lead is widening all over the country. Biden is under performing in Blue states and over performing in Red states. Controversy ensues and voter fraud claims arise seemingly from everywhere. No Blue wave as predicted and Republicans picking up seats but Biden is leading.  How can that be, were there really that many people who voted for Republican senators but also voted for Biden, in this hyper polarized political climate? Counting continues, claims of fraud continue and mainstream media declares Biden the winner and not only the winner but projected to win with the most votes in the history of American elections. More than Obama, more than Trump. From a candidate who avoided the media, performed poorly at the one debate and who couldn’t get 25 people to attend anywhere he campaigned.   To me this could be nothing but fraud, everyone new Biden was a Democratic sacrifice with no chance. The notion of election fraud against Trump gets me thinking maybe he isn’t in on it after all. Maybe he’s not the heel and this is the last ditch effort by the elites to end Trump.

Ten days or so later the mainstream media still has Biden as the winner and downplaying anything Trump or voter fraud. Nothing could ever happen to our country's electoral system which the Democrats said was hijacked by the Russia for 4 fucking years with major censorship and lies coming as a result.  Lawsuits are filed in swing states, mainstream media says they have no chance of winning. More and more claims of voter fraud come out and claims of whistleblowers from all sorts of places coming forward from the post office to Dominion voting machines. Still the mainstream media says there was no fraud, no cheating and it’s absolutely crazy to even consider the idea. Conspiracy theories of a voter fraud trap set by Trump fill forums with a Q-anon feel to it. Maybe this is what had to happen to expose everything on such a grand scale. Maybe…….Maybe not.

So here I am, Nov 15th and still wondering what the fuck is going on. I had lost hope Trump was an outsider and started to suspect he was in on the game all along as the heel and that nothing could be done to change the direction the world apparently was going. Then all this election nonsense comes up and I’m starting to think maybe Trump is the outsider again. Maybe he was going to drain the swamp. Maybe this will expose the greatest scandal of all time confirming an elite cabal with a  NWO/1984 type agenda. Maybe……..Maybe not.

Given the popularity of conspiracies back in 2016 and the piggy backing off that massive audience by Trump was a genius political move. Or maybe it was controlled opposition and a take over of the conspiracy narrative to pull the wool over all our eyes.  I truly do not know. Will this election go for Biden and push us ever closer to a brave new world or will this election expose publicly the corruption and lead to demands of draining the swamp, riots in the streets and general chaos across the country. 

I for one believe this was all prophesied in a book a long time ago and this is the beginning of the end.  Things are definitely at a fever pitch again, seemingly on both sides and people are primed for a change of the status quo. The current political climate is perfect for the rise of charismatic leader who promises change, peace and justice. I think things are going to get absolutely bat shit crazy over the next 4 years either way this election goes and out of the ashes will rise a charismatic world leader who will promise us all peace, safety and justice. But will only deliver hate, death and damnation on a scale never seen before.

“Then, late last month, documents emerged in London concerning Russia's largest tax fraud, an alleged $US230 million heist that led to the untimely deaths of four people and threatens to damage the Russian government.”

''Would you like to add stature and credibility to your company by appointing someone with both an English title and substantial qualifications to your board? Lord Stubbington is available,'' reads a letter circulated by Taylor's wife, Priscila Lustre Taylor.

“The global arms-smuggling network feeds on this frailty, just as it feeds on the cast-off planes and pilots of the former Soviet Union. Adding to the intrigue over the seized flight 4L-AWA in Bangkok was that the Ilyushin-76 transport plane once belonged to a number of notorious international weapons dealers, including Viktor Bout - the so-called ''merchant of death'' and inspiration for the 2005 Hollywood movie Lord of War. The plane's current owner was an entity with headquarters in the United Arab Emirates but operated by Air West Ltd, based in Georgia. Air West had leased the aircraft to a New Zealand firm called SP Trading through a series of bank accounts in Estonia and New York.”

Yes, the timing is obviously politically motivated, yet that doesnt make the contents any less significant or any less damning to me.
The narrative that I was lead to believe was incredibly far from the whole truth.. Only sharing for anyone else like me who was believing a wildly inaccurate narrative.. Some of this was just for context, but a lot of it are things I've only recently learned.

Sorry if its a bit scattered, there was a lot of things I didn't know. Maybe everyone else already knows all the details, if so, I apologize for wasting your time.

It turns out, they're all crooks.

Burisma is a Ukrainian natural gas company that was founded and ran by a man named Mykola Zlochevsky, who was basically the poster-child for corruption.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykola_Zlochevsky

The SFO investigator Richard Gould claimed in the April 2014 court hearing that Zlochevsky’s dual position in Ukraine as both a politician and a businessman gave “rise to a clear - wilful and dishonest exploitation of a direct conflict of interest by a man holding an important public office - to an abuse of the public’s trust in him”.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/12/the-money-machine-how-a-high-profile-corruption-investigation-fell-apart

“May 13, 2014: Burisma Group announced that Hunter Biden [and Devon Archer] would be joining its board. Around that time, Burisma’s founder, a former government official named Mykola Zlochevsky, was under investigation for alleged money laundering by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office.”

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-timeline-idUSKBN1W82HK

Zlochevsky is still suspected of bribery and other crimes by several different countries. (His whereabouts are currently unknown.)

https://www.nationalreview.com/news/senate-probe-finds-john-kerry-falsely-claimed-he-had-no-knowledge-of-hunter-bidens-role-in-burisma/


Viktor Shokin was the Prosecutor General of Ukraine in 2015-2016. He was leading an investigation into Zlochevsky and Burisma.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Shokin

According to him, ""On several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of [Burisma], but I refused to close this investigation.”

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/documents-heighten-scrutiny-on-biden-ukraine-dealings-indicate-hunter-may-have-made-millions


So Burisma.. The same company that sent Hunter Biden $83k every month to do nothing?

https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HSGAC_Finance_Report_FINAL.pdf

“Hunter Biden sat on the Burisma board from April 2014 (while the company was already under investigation) until April 2019.”

https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/13/20912336/hunter-biden-resigns-chinese-firm-impeachment-inquiry-joe-trump


So we know Hunter Biden was on the Board of Directors at Burisma while they were being investigated by Viktor Shokin.. Well here’s where it got interesting to me..

Testimony from sworn affidavit of former Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Viktor Shokin:

“6. ...[President] Poroshenko asked me to resign due to pressure from the US Presidential administration, in particular from Joe Biden, who was the US Vice-President. Biden was threatening to withhold USD$ 1 billion in subsidies to Ukraine until I was removed from office…""

“7. The official reason put forward for my dismissal was that I had allegedly failed to secure the public's trust. Poroshenko and other state officials, including representatives of the US presidential administration, had never previously had any complaints about my work, however. There were no grievances against me or any allegations that had I committed any corruption-related (or, indeed any other) criminal offenses. Biden never stated anything of the kind either…”

“8. The Truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings (""Burisma""), a natural gas firm active in Ukraine, and Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the Board of Directors. I assume Burisma...had the support of the US Vice-President Joe Biden because his son was on the Board of Directors.”

“9. On several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to have a look at the criminal case against Burisma and consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of this company, but I refused to close this investigation. Therefore, I was forced to leave office, under direct and intense pressure from Joe Biden and the US administration. In my conversations with Poroshenko at the time, he was emphatic that I should cease my investigations regarding Burisma. When I did not, he said that the US (via Biden) were refusing to release the USD$ 1 billion promised to Ukraine. He said that he had no choice, therefore, but to ask me to resign.”

- December 8, 2019, former Secretary of State John Kerry was asked by a reporter whether he knew of Hunter Biden’s activities during his tenure as secretary of state in the Obama administration

“I had no knowledge about any of that. None. No,” Kerry told the reporter regarding Biden’s position on the Burisma board. “What would I know about any—no. Why would I know about any company or any individual? No.”

However, Kerry’s former chief of staff David Wade testified to the Senate Homeland Security Committee that he informed Kerry personally of Biden’s role at Burisma. Wade received an email on May 13, 2014, from Kerry’s stepson, Chris Heinz, telling him that Hunter Biden and associate Devon Archer had joined Burisma.

- On 27 February 2020, a Ukraine court forced a probe into Biden's role in firing of prosecutor Viktor Shokin.

John Kerry and Devon Archer are the ones who made me realize this isn't just about Joe and Hunter Biden..

When I looked at John Kerry is when I started to get pissed.. This wasn't just your run of the mill ""pops looking out for his boy"" type of corruption.. This is definitely something bigger than just Hunter and his father..

Archer was definitely the redpill for me..
Who is Devon Archer?

Devon Archer: John Kerry’s fund-raising superstar and close associate of Hunter Biden.

And then I learned about the company BHR Partners... SUPER SKETCHY!!

Founded by Devon Archer, Hunter Biden, John Kerry's son Chris Heinz, and Whitey Bulger's nephew James Bulger. lol

""BHR Partners...is a private investment fund founded in 2013 by Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management Co., Ltd., which is controlled by BANK OF CHINA LIMITED""

""BHR was founded in 2013, by two Chinese-registered asset managers, Bohai Industrial Investment Fund and Harvest Fund Management, and two U.S. organisations, Thornton Group LLC and Rosemont Seneca Partners.""

""According to the Wall Street Journal, ""Bohai is China's oldest private equity firm, having launched the country's first yuan-denominated fund in 2006....Thornton Group is a Boston-based cross-border investment advisory firm founded by Michael Lin and James Bulger, son of former Massachusetts state Senate President William Bulger.[3] Rosemont Seneca is a Washington, D.C.-based investment and advisory firm, founded by Devon Archer, Christopher Heinz, and Hunter Biden""

Nancy Pelosi
(This part seems unrelated, but they are odd coincidences.. Pelosi's companies have also had several questionable land deals and gov't contracts)
Coincidentally, like Hunter Biden, Paul Pelosi Jr also has a way of receiving overpaid positions that he is wildly underqualified for.. and also had a cushy position at companies working in Ukrainian energy..


“The firm InfoUSA, headed by major Clinton backer Vinod Gupta, has placed Pelosi's son, Paul Pelosi Jr., on its payroll – even though he has no experience in the company's main business activities, NewsMax has learned.”

“Just four weeks after Nancy Pelosi became speaker of the House this past January, Gupta and InfoUSA hired her son as a senior vice president. He told NewsMax InfoUsa pays him $180,000 a year.

Even though his job with InfoUSA is considered full-time, Paul Pelosi continues another full-time job, as a home loan officer at Countrywide Home Loans, part of Countrywide Financial, in San Mateo, a suburb of San Francisco.”

**THE DAY ITSELF – EVIDENCE OF COMPLICITY**
______

 
**1. AWOL Chain of Command**

**a.** It is well documented that the officials topping the chain of command for response to a domestic attack – George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Myers, Montague Winfield – all found reason to do something else during the actual attacks, other than assuming their duties as decision-makers.

**b.** Who was actually in charge? Dick Cheney, Richard Clarke, Norman Mineta and the 9/11 Commission directly conflict in their accounts of top-level response to the unfolding events, such that several (or all) of them must be lying.

**2. Air Defense Failures**

**a.** The US air defense system failed to follow standard procedures for responding to diverted passenger flights.

**b.** Timelines: The various responsible agencies – NORAD, FAA, Pentagon, USAF, as well as the 9/11 Commission – gave radically different explanations for the failure (in some cases upheld for years), such that several officials must have lied; but none were held accountable.

**c.** Was there an air defense stand down?

**3. Pentagon Strike**

How was it possible the Pentagon was hit 1 hour and 20 minutes after the attacks began? Why was there no response from Andrews Air Force Base, just 10 miles away and home to Air National Guard units charged with defending the skies above the nation’s capital? How did Hani Hanjour, a man who failed as a Cessna pilot, on his first flight in a Boeing, execute a difficult aerobatic maneuver to strike the Pentagon? Why did the attack strike the just-renovated side, which was largely empty and opposite from the high command?

**4. Wargames**

**a.** US military and other authorities planned or actually rehearsed defensive response to all elements of the 9/11 scenario during the year prior to the attack – including multiple hijackings, suicide crash bombings, and a strike on the Pentagon.

**b.** The multiple military war games planned long in advance and held on the morning of September 11th included scenarios of a domestic air crisis, a plane crashing into a government building, and a large-scale emergency in New York. If this was only an incredible series of coincidences, why did the official investigations avoid the issue? There is evidence that the war games created confusion as to whether the unfolding events were “real world or exercise.” Did war games serve as the cover for air defense sabotage, and/or the execution of an “inside job”?

**5. Flight 93**

Did the Shanksville crash occur at 10:06 (according to a seismic report) or 10:03 (according to the 9/11 Commission)? Does the Commission wish to hide what happened in the last three minutes of the flight, and if so, why? Was Flight 93 shot down, as indicated by the scattering of debris over a trail of several miles?

 _____
**POSSIBLE SMOKING GUNS**
_____

**6. Cell Phones**

Did cell phones work at 30,000 feet in 2001? How many hijackings were attempted? How many flights were diverted?

**7. Demolition Hypothesis**

What caused the collapse of a third skyscraper, WTC 7, which was not hit by a plane? Were the Twin Towers and WTC 7 brought down by explosives? 

How is it physically possible (outside of controlled demolition) for WTC7 to go achieve actual gravitational acceleration, if not for controlled demolition this is a clear violation of basic physical principles. 

______
**FOREKNOWLEDGE & THE ALLEGED HIJACKERS**
______

**8. What did officials know? How did they know it?**

**a.** Multiple allied foreign agencies informed the US government of a coming attack in detail, including the manner and likely targets of the attack, the name of the operation (the “Big Wedding”), and the names of certain men later identified as being among the perpetrators.

**b.** Various individuals came into possession of specific advance knowledge, and some of them tried to warn the US prior to September 11th.

**c.** Certain prominent persons received warnings not to fly on the week or on the day of September 11th.

**9. Able Danger, Plus – Surveillance of Alleged Hijackers**

**a.** The men identified as the 9/11 ringleaders were under surveillance for years beforehand, on the suspicion they were terrorists, by a variety of US and allied authorities – including the CIA, the US military’s “Able Danger” program, the German authorities, Israeli intelligence and others.

**b.** Two of the alleged ringleaders who were known to be under surveillance by the CIA also lived with an FBI asset in San Diego, but this is supposed to be yet another coincidence.

**c** Is A and B just a massive intelligence fictional story? That seems likely

**10. Obstruction of FBI Investigations prior to 9/11**

A group of FBI officials in New York systematically suppressed field investigations of potential terrorists that might have uncovered the alleged hijackers – as the Moussaoui case once again showed. The stories of Sibel Edmonds, Robert Wright, Coleen Rowley and Harry Samit, the “Phoenix Memo,” David Schippers, the 199 orders restricting investigations, the Bush administration’s order to back off the Bin Ladin family, the reaction to the “Bojinka” plot, and John O”Neil do not, when considered in sum, indicate mere incompetence, but high-level corruption and protection of criminal networks, including the network of the alleged 9/11 conspirators. (Nearly all of these examples were omitted from or relegated to fleeting footnotes in the 9/11 Commission Report.

**11. Insider Trading**

**a.** Unknown speculators allegedly used foreknowledge of the Sept. 11th events to profiteer on many markets internationally – including individuals who placed “put options” to short-sell the two airlines, WTC tenants, and WTC re-insurance companies in Chicago and London.

**b.** In addition, suspicious monetary transactions worth hundreds of millions were conducted through offices at the Twin Towers during the actual attacks.

**c.** Initial reports on these trades were suppressed and forgotten, and only years later did the 9/11 Commission and SEC provide a partial, but untenable explanation for only a small number of transactions (covering only the airline put options through the Chicago Board of Exchange).

**12 Who were the perpetrators?**

**a.** Much of the evidence establishing who did the crime is dubious and miraculous: bags full of incriminating material that happened to miss the flight or were left in a van; the “magic passport” of an alleged hijacker, found at Ground Zero; documents found at motels where the alleged perpetrators had stayed days and weeks before 9/11.

**b.** The identities of the alleged hijackers remain unresolved, there are contradictions in official accounts of their actions and travels, and there is evidence several of them had “doubles,” all of which is omitted from official investigations.

**c.** What happened to initial claims by the government that 50 people involved in the attacks had been identified, including the 19 alleged hijackers, with 10 still at large (suggesting that 20 had been apprehended)?

 _____
**THE 9/11 COVER-UP, 2001-2006**
_____

**13. Who Is Osama Bin Ladin?**

**a.** Who judges which of the many conflicting and dubious statements and videos attributed to Osama Bin Ladin are genuine, and which are fake? The most important Osama Bin Ladin video (Nov. 2001), in which he supposedly confesses to masterminding 9/11, appears to be a fake. In any event, the State Department”s translation of it is fraudulent.

**b.** Did Osama Bin Ladin visit Dubai and meet a CIA agent in July 2001 (Le Figaro)? Was he receiving dialysis in a Pakistani military hospital on the night of September 10, 2001 (CBS)?

**c.** Whether by Bush or Clinton: Why is Osama always allowed to escape?

**d.** The terror network associated with Osama, known as the “base” (al-Qaeda), originated in the CIA-sponsored 1980s anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan. When did this network stop serving as an asset to covert operations by US intelligence and allied agencies? What were its operatives doing in Kosovo, Bosnia and Chechnya in the years prior to 9/11?

**e** There is a substantial body of evidence Bin Laden died in 2001

**14. All the Signs of a Systematic 9/11 Cover-up**

**a.** Airplane black boxes were found at Ground Zero, according to two first responders and an unnamed NTSB official, but they were “disappeared” and their existence is denied in the 9/11 Commission Report.

**b.** US officials consistently suppressed and destroyed evidence (like the tapes recorded by air traffic controllers who handled the New York flights).

**c.** Whistleblowers (like Sibel Edmonds and Anthony Shaffer) were intimidated, gagged and sanctioned, sending a clear signal to others who might be thinking about speaking out.

**d.** Officials who “failed” (like Myers and Eberhard, as well as Frasca, Maltbie and Bowman of the FBI) were given promotions.

**15. Poisoning New York**

The White House deliberately pressured the EPA into giving false public assurances that the toxic air at Ground Zero was safe to breathe. This knowingly contributed to an as yet unknown number of health cases and fatalities, and demonstrates that the administration does consider the lives of American citizens to be expendable on behalf of certain interests.

**16. Disposing of the Crime Scene**

The rapid and illegal scrapping of the WTC ruins at Ground Zero disposed of almost all of the structural steel which was indispensable to any investigation of the collapse mechanics. (See also item no. 23, below.)

**17. Anthrax**

Mailings of weapons-grade anthrax – which caused a practical suspension of the 9/11 investigations – were traced back to US military stock. Soon after the attacks began in October 2001, the FBI approved the destruction of the original samples of the Ames strain, disposing of perhaps the most important evidence in identifying the source of the pathogens used in the mailings. Were the anthrax attacks timed to coincide with the Afghanistan invasion? Why were the letters sent only to media figures and to the leaders of the opposition in the Senate (who had just raised objections to the USA PATRIOT Act)?

**18. The Stonewall**

**a.** Colin Powell promised a “white paper” from the State Department to establish the authorship of the attacks by al-Qaeda. This was never forthcoming, and was instead replaced by a paper from Tony Blair, which presented only circumstantial evidence, with very few points actually relating to September 11th.

**b.** Bush and Cheney pressured the (freshly-anthraxed) leadership of the Congressional opposition into delaying the 9/11 investigation for months. The administration fought against the creation of an independent investigation for more than a year.

**c.** The White House thereupon attempted to appoint Henry Kissinger as the chief investigator, and acted to underfund and obstruct the 9/11 Commission.

**19. A Record of Official Lies**

**a.** “No one could have imagined flying planes into buildings” – a transparent falsehood upheld repeatedly by Rice, Rumsfeld and Bush.

**b.** “Iraq was connected to 9/11″ – The most “outrageous conspiracy theory” of all, with the most disastrous impact.

**20. Pakistani Connection – Congressional Connection**

**a.** The Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, creator of the Taliban and close ally to both the CIA and “al-Qaeda,” allegedly wired $100,000 to Mohamed Atta just prior to September 11th, reportedly through the ISI asset Omar Saeed Sheikh (later arrested for the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, who was investigating ISI connections to “al-Qaeda.”)

**b.** This was ignored by the congressional 9/11 investigation, although the senator and congressman who ran the probe (Bob Graham and Porter Goss) were meeting with the ISI chief, Mahmud Ahmed, on Capitol Hill on the morning of September 11th.

**c.** About 25 percent of the report of the Congressional Joint Inquiry was redacted, including long passages regarding how the attack (or the network allegedly behind it) was financed. Graham later said foreign allies were involved in financing the alleged terror network, but that this would only come out in 30 years.

**21. 9/11 Commission**

**a.** The September 11th families who fought for and gained an independent investigation (the 9/11 Commission) posed 400-plus questions, which the 9/11 Commission adopted as its roadmap. The vast majority of these questions were completely ignored in the Commission hearings and the final report.

**b.** The membership and staff of the 9/11 Commission displayed awesome conflicts of interest. The families called for the resignation of Executive Director Philip Zelikow, a Bush administration member and close associate of “star witness” Condoleezza Rice, and were snubbed. Commission member Max Cleland resigned, condemning the entire exercise as a “scam” and “whitewash.”

**c.** The 9/11 Commission Report is notable mainly for its obvious omissions, distortions and outright falsehoods – ignoring anything incompatible with the official story, banishing the issues to footnotes, and even dismissing the still-unresolved question of who financed 9/11 as being “of little practical significance.”

**22. Crown Witnesses Held at Undisclosed Locations**

The alleged masterminds of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohamed (KSM) and Ramzi Binalshibh, are reported to have been captured in 2002 and 2003, although one Pakistani newspaper said KSM was killed in an attempted capture. They have been held at undisclosed locations and their supposed testimonies, as provided in transcript form by the government, form much of the basis for /11 Commission Report (although the Commission’s request to see them in person was denied). After holding them for years, why doesn’t the government produce these men and put them to trial?

**23. Spitzer Redux**

**a.** Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York State, snubbed pleas by New York citizens to open 9/11 as a criminal case.

**b.** Spitzer also refused to allow his employee, former 9/11 Commission staff member Dietrich Snell, to testify to the Congress about his (Snell”s) role in keeping “Able Danger” entirely out of the 9/11 Commission Report.

**24. NIST Omissions**

After the destruction of the WTC structural steel, the official Twin Towers collapse investigation was left with almost no forensic evidence, and thus could only provide dubious computer models of ultimately improvable hypotheses. It failed to even test for the possibility of explosives. 

**25. Radio Silence**

The 9/11 Commission and NIST both allowed the continuing cover-up of how Motorola’s faulty radios, purchased by the Giuliani administration, caused firefighter deaths at the WTC – once again showing the expendability, even of the first responders.

**26. The Legal Catch-22**

**a.** Hush Money – Accepting victims’ compensation barred most September 11th families from pursuing discovery through litigation.

**b.** Judge Hellerstein – Those who refused compensation to pursue litigation and discovery had their cases consolidated under the same judge (and as a rule dismissed).

**27. Saudi Connections**

**a.** The 9/11 investigations made light of the “Bin Ladin Airlift” during the no-fly period, and ignored the long-standing Bush family business ties to the Bin Ladin family fortune. (A company in which both families held interests, the Carlyle Group, was holding its annual meeting on September 11th, with George Bush Sr., James Baker, and two brothers of Osama Bin Ladin in attendance.)

**b.** The issue of Ptech.

**28. Media Blackout of Prominent Doubters**

The official story has been questioned and many of the above points were raised by members of the US Congress, retired high-ranking officers of the US military, the three leading third-party candidates for President in the 2004 election, a member of the 9/11 Commission who resigned in protest, a former high-ranking adviser to the George W. Bush administration, former ministers to the German, British and Canadian governments, the commander-in-chief of the Russian air force, 100 luminaries who signed the “9/11 Truth Statement,” and the presidents of Iran and Venezuela. Not all of these people agree fully with each other, but all would normally be considered newsworthy. Why has the corporate-owned US mass media remained silent about these statements, granting due coverage only to the comments of actor Charlie Sheen?
____
**GEOPOLITICS, TIMING AND POSSIBLE MOTIVES**
_____

**29. “The Great Game”**

The Afghanistan invasion was ready for Bush’s go-ahead on September 9, 2001, with US and UK force deployments to the region already in place or underway. This followed the failure earlier that year of backdoor diplomacy with the Taliban (including payments of $125 million in US government aid to Afghanistan), in an attempt to secure a unity government for that country as a prerequisite to a Central Asian pipeline deal.

**30. The Need for a “New Pearl Harbor”**

Principals in US foreign policy under the current Bush administration (including Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Perle and others) have been instrumental in developing long-running plans for worldwide military hegemony, including an invasion of the Middle East, dating back to the Ford, Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations. They reiterated these plans in the late 1990s as members of the “Project for a New American Century,” and stated a clear intent to invade Iraq for the purpose of “regime change.” After 9/11, they lost no time in their attempt to tie Iraq to the attacks.

**31. Perpetual “War on Terror”**

9/11 is supposed to provide carte-blanche for an open-ended, global and perpetual “War on Terror,” against any enemy, foreign or domestic, that the executive branch chooses to designate, and regardless of whether evidence exists to actually connect these enemies to 9/11.

**32. Attacking the Constitution**

**a.** The USA PATRIOT Act was written before 9/11, Homeland Security and the “Shadow Government” were developed long before 9/11, and plans for rounding up dissidents as a means for suppressing civil disturbance have been in the works for decades.

**b.** 9/11 was used as the pretext to create a new, extra-constitutional executive authority to declare anyone an “enemy combatant” (including American citizens), to detain persons indefinitely without habeas corpus, and to “render” such persons to secret prisons where torture is practiced.

**33. Legal Trillions**

9/11 triggers a predictable shift of public spending to war, and boosts public and private spending in the “new” New Economy of “Homeland Security,” biometrics, universal surveillance, prisons, civil defense, secured enclaves, security, etc.

**34. Plundered Trillions?**

On September 10, 2001, Donald Rumsfeld announced a “war on waste” after an internal audit found that the Pentagon was “missing” 2.3 trillion dollars in unaccounted assets. On September 11th, this was as good as forgotten.

**35. Did 9/11 prevent a stock market crash?**

Did anyone benefit from the destruction of the Securities and Exchange Commission offices at WTC 7, and the resultant crippling of hundreds of fraud investigations?

**36. Resource Wars**

**a.** What was discussed in the Energy Task Force meetings under Dick Cheney in 2001? Why is the documentation of these meetings still being suppressed?

**b.** Is Peak Oil a motive for 9/11 as inside job?

**37. The “Little Game”**

**b.** Was 9/11 an update of the Pentagon-approved “Project Northwoods” plan for conducting self-inflicted, false-flag terror attacks in the United States, and blaming them on a foreign enemy?

97,Gates divorcing possibly cause of this? Had to go back and dig this up. Thing is he owns stock and would have to sell right?,896.0,n48fnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/n48fnt/gates_divorcing_possibly_cause_of_this_had_to_go/,197.0,1620078740.0,"The real reason for Bezos divorce.

Keep a close eye on Jeff Bezos in the near. I have a theory about his recent divorce. As many of you may know, the economy will be having a major correction soon. Stocks could easily go down 50% or more. Bezos, being close with the CIA and the richest man in the world, probably knows this. He knows that he will lose tens of billions of dollars. So what does he want to do? Sell as much Amazon stock as possible. Because his entire net worth is in Amazon stock. But imagine if Bezos suddenly started offloading billions in Amazon shares? The stock price would crash. The entire market could crash from something that big. He could also get charged with securities fraud if he sells because he knows something will go down soon.

So what is old Jeff to do?

Follow the lead of the only executive to get away scot free after Enron collapsed. When Enron was about to collapse, all the executives sold millions of dollars of their shares. They ended up getting charged for this fraud. Except for one man. He just so happened to divorce his wife for some random stripper. Right before the collapse. A judge ordered him to sell his shares and split the proceeds with his now ex wife. So he was able to get away will it all.

My theory is that Bezos know that the stock market will soon collapse. He wants to have a way to sell off his shares without getting in trouble or alerting the public that something is wrong. So he orchestrates some high profile affair and his wife leaving him. He makes sure there is a ton of drama to keep it in the news. Then during the divorce proceedings, he is ""ordered"" to sell his stock. So nobody thinks twice.

It turns out that the person who leaked the affair story to the press was none other than the brother of the mistress. He also just happened to come out an publicly say that Bezos and his wife are't telling the truth about the divorce and that they have other reasons.

&#x200B;

So keep an eye out on this. When he starts to offload his Amazon shares, you know the collapse is imminent.

The 30K Troops were a show of force to keep D.C. at peace for a virtual inauguration. 74 million voters realize they have been lied to, and watch in silence as Justin Timberlake performs songs from 15 years ago while Biden is sworn in.

2) There has been merit to ALL of the bullshit. Q, in some capacity, was not a psy-op, and Thor’s fucking hammer is dropped. Emergency Broadcast System reveals the true nature of the election interference, and our military doesn’t stand by idle, as they work for The Commander in Chief. Mass arrests start as all the proof comes tumbling down. Anarchy begins as half the country’s collective reality is shattered, that perhaps they weren’t the good guys all along. Republicans. Democrats. House Representatives. Senators. Left. Right. A total purge of officials who have betrayed their sacred duties to the Constitution.

When it’s (IF) revealed, there will be bad actors on a global scale. Insurrection Act. Martial Law. Full cyber warfare against countries who dare tried to interfere with the worlds last beacon of hope, The United States of America.

Full disclosure of myself. I have never believed in Q stuff, I didn’t even know it was still a thing until a couple weeks ago when this all really ramped up. Nor was I a Trump supporter. I think he cares deeply about our country, but I also think largely he’s a buffoon who was in way over his head throughout his presidency. However, I never believed him to be malicious or complicit in furthering the new global economic agenda.


I hate most Republicans. I hate most Democrats. I hate Nancy Pelosi, and I hate Mitch McConnell. These people have sold us out since long ago, and it baffles me how these corrupt officials are voted in as long as they have been. In closing statements, we have been leading up to this moment for 4 years. It’s not just a Trump or Biden argument. This has future implications that will forever alter our economic and geopolitical landscape. We are at a tipping point in Society. We’ve been hearing it forever. Deep State. Corruption. We see it everyday, and this is the closest we’ll ever get to exposing it if such a thing exists. All the Q bullshit will be proven false or humanity will have a reckoning. There are no other outcomes. 

I only hope, if there was large scale interference that altered our election, the American people are informed and whomever the next president is, they are legitimate and rightfully voted in by We The People.

100,How being a video editor for pro wrestling has changed how I view the world.,882.0,8qgh0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8qgh0x/how_being_a_video_editor_for_pro_wrestling_has/,158.0,1528781757.0,"Silly title I know, but follow me hear, there's a lesson to be learned...

So for going on three years now, I have been working for a well known independent wrestling orginization (essentially the minor leagues) doing their video editing. I won't reveal the name in effort to hide my identity, but the only clue I'll give is I am currently working on footage from this past saturdays show.

Now, onto how this all relates to conspiracy stuff. Well, it all falls on selective editing, or manipulating footage to get teh emotional reaction you are looking for. Fan or not, it's pretty well known that pro wrestling is heavily storyline based, there's good guys, and bad guys, and tweeners. One issue every company has, including WWE, is maintaining the popularity of the good guys, while keeping the heat on the bad guys. Very often a bad guy becomes so good at portraying his character that the fans start to support them. They'll cheer your villain, and boo your stories hero, and now  your left with footage that gives off the opposite emotion of what you had intended. That's where I come in. Very often I have to manipulate the footage to put out a final result that tells the story we wanted it to. That means cutting out crowd reactions, or replacing it with boos from a seperate segment, cutting out the lines that made the bad guys get cheered, or editing out the parts that make the good guy look weak. This is something that WWE has been known to do frequently. Antoher outlet I have noticed using similar techniques...MSM news outlets.

Being a video editor it has become impossible to watch anything without noticing the editing within it, it makes it difficult to actually enjoy the story sometimes. I give major credit to a show that can actually grasp my attention to the story and not the editing (Game of Thrones is an example of one that keeps me in viewer mode more often than not) But when I am watching the news, I am in full editors mind set. Every video clip shown, every opinion room an average Joe,  every breaking story explained has me asking a long list of questions. ""Why did you start the clip there and not earlier"" ""why did you cut out sentences from what this person was saying?"" ""Why did avoid showing certain material relating to the story."" It all goes back to what my goal is in editing wrestling. Make your heroes look strong, and your villains look evil.

A few examples of this from recent events. There's a Project Veritas video (often criticized for using the same editing techniques I'm reffering to) about CNN. Within it they show a segment on voter fraud, and ask a pannel of average people about their opinions on it. When they ask the right wing voter his opinion of it, he gives some nonsensical, all over the place response, which capped off with the line ""it's all over the place, just look on the internet."" At first glance you would think this guy was a nut job, but the Project Veritas video goes on to show the leaked raw/un\-edited audio from that interview. In the audio, the guys full response is actually coherent, he mentions that he was a poll worker, and when he says check the internet, he lists specific sources to do more research on the topic. All of that was cut from the interview, and each clip creates 2 very different ""characters"" of the same person. Another example was the whole Trump Koy Pond thing, where the internet blasted him for dumping an entire cup of fish food into a Koy Pond, but shortly after, the full video was released which actually showed the Japanese Prime Minister doing the exact same thing seconds before, and Trump followed suit. (allow me to just clear the air, I am not a Trump supporter, didn't vote for him, but I don't jump blindly into this Trump hate without research)

The moment that really opened my eyes for me, was the Democratic Convention's second day, after the massive Bernie Walk Out. There were reports and photos coming in of empty seats, paid seat fillers and plants, as well as use of camera angles, sound manipulation, crowd placement to create the illusion of a packed house. These are all things that WWE is known to do, and that I have had to work with my self. To the average viewer, this stuff is unknown, and they may never even think of any of these things when viewing the news, taking in the information they're being fed without question. Their hero looks strong, their enemy looks evil, and they continue about their day...never realizing that the real world is just as fake and scripted as pro wrestling. ",conspiracy,fraud

[Read Part I first if you haven't already](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cvdw60/wanna_go_down_an_interdimensional_rabbit_hole/)

[INTRODUCTION:](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d4c3lg/wanna_go_down_an_interdimensional_rabbit_hole/)

**The ultimate goal of this project was to obtain a better understanding specifically of the spiritual/metaphysical aspects of the pedophilia which is so inexplicably rampant amongst the highest echelon's of every society in the world.  In the last post we explored the idea of this secret ancient occult knowledge and how it has been passed down amongst the rich and powerful in secrecy since the beginning of civilization. We found out in Part I that this ""secret ancient occult knowledge"" is actually just a Hermetic view of the world that is basically an understanding that the spiritual/metaphysical aspects of reality are not only real, but far more important than the simple material experience which we live everyday. It is no mistake that the term ""occult"" (which literally means secret or hidden) has been so heavily weaponized especially in the US, it is immediately associated with pseudo-scientific lunacy by almost everyone mainly thanks to Hollywood. This is what originally motivated me to begin this project, the mainstream's overt insistency that anything spiritual or metaphysical is to be laughed at was becoming a bit too obvious for me. This, paired with the obvious spiritual obsessions ie (symbolism, rituals etc) of the most powerful people in the world was really bothering me and inspired me to make these posts.**

**SECTION I:** That which is apparent to our five senses is only a fraction of the human experience

.

* ***Before we uncover the ancient roots of this malevolent immaterial force we have to solidify the fact that there is truly a metaphysical aspect to this reality. This is my expanded research on my claims in Part I.***

First we must do a recap on the ancient origins of esoteric and spiritual knowledge. In Part I, we showed that an extremely diluted form of Gnosticism (a strictly metaphysical belief system) influenced each and every one of the mainstream religions practiced today. But what I failed to mention in the last post was the fact that Gnosticism was specifically derived from the Hermetic school of thought which gained popularity in ancient Egypt and is said to have originated far before the earliest of our known history. Hermeticism is said to be passed down from the ancients of the “lost land” and has been regarded as the oldest form of knowledge even amongst the ancient Egyptians who taught it and popularized it. The Hermetic Teachings are to be found in all lands, among all religions;  this knowledge has been very carefully disseminated amongst the elites of various secret societies for generations upon generations. I recommend reading the first chapter of the Kybalion if you want a full picture of its origins.

\-**So why should we take Hermeticism seriously?**

Here I will show that these unimaginably-ancient Hermetic Principles are constantly being proven in modern science through quantum mechanics

**--Mentalism:** The first Hermetic principle tells us that *“All is mind, the universe is mental.”*

This is now being explained by breakthroughs in quantum gravity, the field devoted to uniting Einstein’s relativity with quantum theory, as due to quantum information processing, which tells us that our spacetime is [an emergent simulation](https://www.academia.edu/456203/Simulating_Space_and_Time). Elsewhere, experiments into the foundations of quantum mechanics, such as tests of the [Leggett inequality,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leggett_inequality) have actually falsified material realism.  Recent discoveries tell us that spacetime emerges specifically from entangled information, the i[nformation generating quantum entanglement](https://www.nature.com/news/the-quantum-source-of-space-time-1.18797), the phenomenon wherein two or more particles affect each other at vast distances at speeds faster than light (Previously regarded as impossible by the Laws of Physics) .

Meanwhile the[Integrated Information Theory](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03633-1_14) of consciousness, or IIT, identifies entangled information as integrated information or consciousness:

*”Quantum entanglement and integrated information, to the extent that one cannot perturb two elements independently,* ***they are informationally one***”

**Putting these two together we see therefore that spacetime emerges from consciousness.**[The universe is after all a mental information construct](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03633-1_14) **inside of some greater consciousness, which is of course the same thing as the Hermetic Principle of Mentalism.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**--Vibration**: The next Hermetic principle ill cover, the Principle of Vibration tells us that: “Nothing rests; Everything moves; Everything vibrates.”

Modern physics exactly parallels this with the wavefunction. According to the Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics, everything can be defined by a wavefunction that describes a quantum probability wave, which vibrates at a specific frequency.

\--Interestingly, the parallels do not stop there. Other direct parallels specific to both quantum mechanics, as well as even more advanced physics exist. *The Kybalion* states that:

*“if the vibrations be continually increased the object would mount up the successive states of manifestation… until it would finally re-enter The All,”*

**As it turns out, the frequency of an object’s wavefunction is directly proportional to the energy content of the object being described. So the higher the vibration of the object the greater the degree of its mass or energy content, just as described in the quote.**

A discovery regarding the relationship between space and quantum entanglement demonstrated that spacetime behaves as a holistic pattern of entanglement known as a string-net, and that subatomic particles emerge from this string-net. This network of entanglements is of course a field of vibrating quantum waves.

String theory meanwhile tells us something similar. According to string theory matter and space are actually two descriptions of the same thing. This is shown by the fact that spacetime created by matter due to relativity shares the same vibratory frequency as the matter that generated it. The spacetime is merely matter at a different degree of vibration and vice-versa, exactly as explained in the quote.

* ***I will stop these draining and complex examples here but this can be done with almost every one of the main Hermetic principles (check for yourself). How is this possible? How can the most ancient human ideas be explaining quantum theories we are just finding out today? In the next part I will show how the most complicated scientific theories in history have struggled with this problem.***

**--Continuing with Modern scientists struggles with the relation between ancient knowledge and modern quantum theories we have learned in the last century**

&#x200B;

**Werner Heisenberg**:

Quote from [Tao of Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Physics-Exploration-Parallels-Mysticism/dp/1590308352)

“I had several discussions with Heisenberg. I lived in England then \[circa 1972\], and I visited him several times in Munich and showed him the whole manuscript chapter by chapter. He was very interested and very open, and **he told me something that I think is not known publicly because he never published it. He said that he was well aware of these parallels. While he was working on quantum theory he went to India to lecture and was a guest of** **Tagore**\*\*. He talked a lot with Tagore about Indian philosophy. Heisenberg told me that these talks had helped him a lot with his work in physics, because they showed him that all these new ideas in quantum physics were in fact not all that crazy. He realized there was, in fact, a whole culture that subscribed to very similar ideas. Heisenberg said that this was a great help for him.\*\* **Niels Bohr** **had a similar experience when he went to China.”**

# 

**Erwin Schrödinger**:

“Nirvana is a state of pure blissful knowledge… It has nothing to do with the individual. The ego or its separation is an illusion. Indeed in a certain sense two ‘I”s are identical namely when one disregards all special contents — their Karma. The goal of man is to preserve his Karma and to develop it further… when man dies his Karma lives and creates for itself another carrier.

**“In itself, the insight is not new. The earliest records, to my** **knowledge**\*\*, date back some 2500 years or more... the recognition\*\* [**ATMAN**](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Atman) **=** [**BRAHMAN**](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brahman) **(the personal** **self** **equals the omnipresent,** [**all-comprehending eternal self**](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_All)**) was in Indian thought considered, far from being blasphemous, to represent the quintessence of deepest insight into the happenings of the world.**

&#x200B;

**Niels Bohr:**

“For a parallel regarding to the lesson regarding the limited applicability of such customary idealizations, w**e must in fact turn to quite other branches of science, such as psychology, or even to that kind of epistemological problems with which already thinkers like Buddha and Lao Tse have been confronted, when trying to harmonize our position as spectators and actors in the great drama of existence**.”

**“** In the psychophysical parallelism, as envisaged by Leibniz and Spinoza, has obtained a wider scope through the development o**f atomic physics, which forces us to an attitude towards the problem of explanation recalling ancient wisdom, that when searching for harmony in life one must never forget that in the drama of existence we are ourselves both actors and spectators.**

**Bohr adopted the yin yang symbol as part of his family coat of arms when he was knighted in 1947.**

**Wolfganf Pauli**\*: He viewed that the acquisition of knowledge in mathematics or quantum physics “gives rise, however, to a situation transcending natural science” that can even acquire a “religious function” in human experience. This is not a belief in the religions of old, but as Pauli states “I do not believe in the possible future of mysticism in the old form.\* ***However, I do believe that the natural sciences will out of themselves bring forth a counter pole in their adherents, which connects to the old mystic elements.”***

**Alber Einstein**: This \[the theories connecting ancient mysticism with modern quantum mechanics\] led to Einstein’s famous attempt at “breaking” quantum physics, the [EPR paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox). At first a thought experiment which appeared to demonstrate quantum physics violating the seemingly well established principle of [locality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality), later experiments showed that quantum physics instead proved locality to be false, therefore collapsing the laws of physics.

Violations of locality and determinism seemed to bother Einstein greatly, and this can be seen in his famous quote objecting to the randomness involved in wave function collapse under Bohr’s interpretation, that “God does not play dice”.

Einstein wrote in his autobiography:

*“All my attempts to adapt the theoretical foundation of physics to this new type of knowledge (quantum mechanics) have failed completely. It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under one, with no firm foundation to be seen anywhere, upon which one could have built.”*

**Keynote**: I am by no means claiming that these scientists have “cracked the code” of ancient mysticism or have indefinitely solidified a scientifically proven connection between these ancient ideologies and modern physics. I am not even saying that these scientists fully believed the point im trying to prove her at all.  But let's just assume for a second that what I am arguing is true, these ancient Hermetic texts have divine origins and are a correct philosophical interpretation of the intertwined physical and metaphysical reality of the universe. If this was the case wouldn't it be safe to predict that the most intelligent minds, attempting to understand the laws of the universe, in modern history would be in a constant intellectual struggle with these ideas throughout their career? Well, know we know that they have been.

**Now let’s look at the physicists behind the CIA and KGB during the Cold War**:

\-- Because of the Cold War, accounts of alleged psychic abilities (extrasensory perception, as in telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, a.k.a. telekinesis, and psychometry) could no longer be ignored by the US and USSR intelligence agencies out of fear of losing a competitive edge. Experiments and tests on people with these abilities were abundant at this time,  thankfully coming along with an overwhelming amount of scientific literature trying to figure out how the hell this was even possible. It soon became obvious that well.. it wasn’t, well at least not within our current laws of physics, we obviously needed to reevaluate our current understanding of physics just like Einstein in that quote. This called for scientists to start taking the theories of quantum mechanics seriously. Quantum mechanics ended up being the first field of study which could offer natural explanations for these phenomena.

\--The significant results of the findings in the document [ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF GATEWAY PROCESS,](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) showed that **the only way to naturally explain this kind of paranormal/esoteric phenomena, scientists view the universe through the Holographic Universe Theory.**

***We know from the last post that there is as much evidence behind the holographic universe theory as*** [there is behind the current big bang theory,](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170130083231.htm) ***I elaborated on this in Part 1.***

\--There becomes a point where, both physicists and us a society, have to be either all in on this holographic theory of the universe or just discredit it altogether. There simply is no other way to explain the paranormal phenomena which people around the world are conducting. The problem with going “all in” with this theory is that it tears down everything that we know, again just like we saw Einstein stressing in his quote.

This is best exemplified in [a CIA document](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP82-00039R000100230012-3.pdf) showing a Soviet Scientist, tasked with constructing a quantum theory of reality. He states:

*“The repeated attempt to construct a quantum theory of field..* ***that would not be purley illusory and in which it would not be necessary to physically absurd consequences***\*, have not been met with success”\*

Read [The Paraphysics Warsaw Pact](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/NSA-RDP96X00790R000100020010-5.pdf) to see how real paranormal abilities are

&#x200B;

**SECTION II:** What exactly am I looking for?

&#x200B;

* ***Now that I have laid out my expanded argument for the reality of the metaphysical/spiritual nature of the universe, It is time to tie back in to the ultimate goal of this project.***

To tie back into Part I, we must understand that all of those in power have a complete and total understanding of the Hermetic spiritual nature of the universe which they have actively and purposely hidden from the masses over generations. Those in power have used this spiritual/metaphysical knowledge to their advantage in order to maintain ultimate and total dominance over the world and its inhabitants.

**So where does the evil that embodies these elite tie in?**:

Going back to Robert Bernard; [here he explains](https://youtu.be/VA3BDYpkDbo?t=2818) how spirituality came into play during his time as a top player in this international crime syndicate:

“Then you start to discover that there is much more than what I call the 4 dimensions, you have length, width, height, and time… but then you start to discover that we are the cross point of multi-dimensions and frequencies.. You start to sense that there is really something going on in the other frequencies and dimensions and then **you start also to know that there are low frequency beings, what we call now the fallen angels or the Djinn, who are really serving a sort of master… a dark manifestation entity known as Lucifer… We really have to face the fact that besides the 4 dimensions we have this interaction with other intellects, other beings.. And the ones I was serving (negative manifestation Lucifer) was real- it was not a joke, including the sacrifice of children everything was real.**

**I also came across a reference to these evil entities in the book** [*The Vatican Exposed*](https://archive.org/details/vaticanexposed00paul/page/6)

*“The scoundrels we study remain even to this day some of the most accomplished* ***matter deceivers*** *in western history. The fraud and masquerade we encounter in these pages is not only a product of a particular conspiracy or cabal it is older than the pyramids and of institutional character.* ***They are two-faced operators, for whom double-thinking and double-dealing are second nature..to an immensity greater than we can imagine. We are in the presence of the servants of an intelligence almost without limit; and second only to God”***

&#x200B;

**Once again an immaterial evil force was mentioned by the Vatican’s top exorcist** [Father Gabriel Amorth:](https://www.theregister.co.uk/Print/2010/03/11/vatican_exorcist/)

According to The Times, Amorth blames ""cardinals who do not believe in Jesus, **and bishops who are linked to the Demon"".**

Father Gabriele Amorth, who according to The Times is president of honour of the Association of Exorcists, said the Vatican's current problems - including **recurrent child abuse allegations and a brewing gay prostitution scandal - can be largely attributed to Lucifer's visitation at the Vatican.**

&#x200B;

**Main Point:** What the fuck are all these different sources talking about? I was so goddamn lost at this point in my research but at the same time absolutely positive(my opinion) that these consistent allusions to this immaterial force, couldn't just all be bullshit, there is an active evil presence playing out malevolent events in our world to serve a higher spiritual being and I was not going to stop until I found out what it was.

&#x200B;

**Section III**: The ancient descriptions of this immaterial force

* ***My search for information regarding these malevolent beings started with the ancient accounts of these forces in various ancient cultures. Here is what I came up with:***

Like with most of this project I will start with the most ancient description I can find which, again, is the Gnostics, this is how they describe these malevolent spiritual forces which they call Archons:

**Archons:**

\-They are ***cyborgs*** inhabiting the planetary system (exclusive of the earth, sun and moon), which is \*\*described as a virtual world (\*\**stereoma*) they construct by imitating the geometric forms emanated from the *Pleroma*, the realm of the Generators, the Cosmic Gods.

\-Archons are said to feel **intense envy toward humanity** because we possess the intentionality they lack

\-Have no empathy, **feed off of negative emotions, have no creative ability**

\-Archons are an alien force that **intrudes subliminally upon the human mind and deviates our intelligence** away from its proper and sane applications.

\-Archons are ***psycho-spiritual parasites***\*\*.\*\*

\-The risk they pose by invading our mental software is far greater than any physical risk they might pose by erratically breaching the biosphere.

\-Because the **Archons need human complicity to gain power** **over humankind, any one who assists them can be considered a kind of Archon, an accessory.**

\-Working through **telepathy and suggestion**, the Archons attempt to **deviate us from our proper course of evolution.** Their most successful technique is to use religious ideology to insinuate their way of thinking and, in effect, substitute their mind-set for ours.

**Keynote**: to quickly summarize here, an Archon is a **parasitic,** **cyborg, alien/foreign intruder.** They are **envious** of certain human traits, attach to hosts, and have **telepathic** powers at their dispense. Really think about the meaning of these ideas, especially the bold terms, before moving on to the next section.

&#x200B;

* ***Now we are going to take a look at various ancient religions from different time periods and cultures and read their descriptions of this immaterial evil force. Keep your eyes out for the similarities!***

\--**Quran-Djinn**(specifically referenced by Ronald Bernard): Djinn are capable of possessing human beings. They are said to enter the bloodstream and circulate rapidly through the body. They cause mental and physical problems, and also disrupt marriages and relationships. Asking a Djinn to leave, or bargaining with it, may not be enough to get it to go, and someone who is trained may be needed to perform an exorcism to get it out of the body.

According to Islamic writings, Djinn live alongside other creatures but form a world other than that of mankind. Though they see us they cannot be seen. Characteristics they share with human beings are intellect and freedom to choose between right and wrong and between good and bad, but according to the Qur'an their origin is different from that of man

&#x200B;

\-- ***Mesopotamian Toltec-The Allies***: . The Allies lack a brain, **which means they have no factory to create emotions**, but they need the **ethereal energy of emotions to sustain their life. Allies push humans to create traumas in order to create fear, which they feed upon.”**

The Allies must then **convert emotion into the negative emotion on which they feed**. He explained that the Allies had no mechanism to produce the negative emotional energy themselves. They had to turn human emotional energy into negative energy before they could harvest it. In order to turn human emotion negative, the Allies are **capable of putting fearful thoughts into the minds of humans which in turn generates the negative emotion on which they feed.** *These entities are attracted to negative emotional energy much as sharks are to blood.*

&#x200B;

***--Wetiko-Native Americans***:  Wetiko is an Algonquin word for a **cannibalistic spirit that is driven by greed, excess, and selfish consumption** (in Ojibwa it is *windigo, wintiko* in Powhatan). It deludes its host into **believing that cannibalizing the life-force of others (others in the broad sense, including animals and other forms of life) is a logical and morally upright way to live**.

*-Wetiko* **short-circuits the individual’s ability to see itself** as an enmeshed and interdependent part of a balanced environment and **raises the self-serving ego to supremacy.** It is this false separation of self from nature that makes this cannibalism, rather than simple murder.

*-Wetiko* can **describe both the infection and the body infected;** a person can be infected by *wetiko* or, in cases where the infection is very advanced, can personify the disease: ‘*a wetiko*.’ This holds true for cultures and systems; all can be described as being *wetiko* if they routinely manifest these traits.

&#x200B;

***--Chitauri - Ancient African:*** \-The **Chitauri** are an evil extraterrestrial race of shape-shifting humanoids

\- We are told the **Chitauri feed on the energy that we give them**. They **make us fight against each other, and when the whole world is drowning in death, fear, and terror,** the Chitauri get f**ed by the dark power which is brought out when humans destroy the planet on which they live**. **They are fed when human minds think at certain levels. We are told they want us to think at certain levels and they reward us with long lives.**

\-**-E’epa-Hawai**i: The e'epa are mental forces that have the ability to **intrude into the human mind.** They operate through subterfuge and psychic stealth.

T**hey are adversaries who are drawn to humans because they wish to acquire our human capacity for creative imagination**. Humans are creators, and they are not. Because of this, the deceivers will always be thwarted by the superiority of our human species.""

&#x200B;

***--Bible-Demons:*** *Demons have the* ***ability to possess people***\*. These fallen angels are what the Bible refers to as demons.\* ***Demons are able to take shape, form and be visible to humans*** *(Job 4:15). Demons may be exercised, or driven out, from a possessed person. However, this may be dangerous if not followed by stringent cleaning and discipleship. Without proper spiritual care, the person might then be open for a seven-fold infestation (Matthew 12:45).*

***Demons confuse the truth by utilizing demonic lies and half-truths*** *(1 John 4:4).Those who* ***worship idols and pagan gods are really worshipping and sacrificing to demons.*** *D****emons live to deceive people into worshipping themselves*** *(1 Corinthians 10:20-21). The Bible teaches that demons can inhabit animals and people (Matthew 8:31)*

\--**Zuswazi Africa-Zulu**:

And, it is further said that these Zuswazi, these Imbulu, or whatever you choose to call them, are not capable of eating solid food. T**hey either eat human blood, or they eat that power, the energy that is generated when human beings, on the surface of the Earth, are fighting and killing each other in large numbers.**

**Main point**: How is it possible that all of these cultures from all over the world from entirely different time periods are describing the same force with the same characteristics? There has got to be some reality to this, something more than simply primitive fairytale like we are taught. So I researched…

&#x200B;

**Section IV**: Modern Descriptions of this evil inter-dimensional force

* \---By this point I knew I was on to something, I used these descriptions to search for other accounts of these forces. The first similar and reliable I came across was the work of gifted Austrian Philosopher [Rudolph Steiner(1861-1925)](https://exonews.org/rudolf-steiner-describes-the-hostile-spiritual-beings-who-feed-off-of-your-fear-and-anxiety/)who was a stand philosopher and academic of his time. Steiner states:

“ *There are beings in the spiritual realms for* ***whom anxiety and fear emanating from human beings offer welcome food. When humans have no anxiety and fear, then these creatures starve.****” declared Steiner. “****These beings are hostile towards humanity …and they become more and more powerful (from this negative human energy nutrition) …launching cruel attacks on human beings.****”*

*“Therefore,” says Steiner, “it is above all necessary… that the person who enters the spiritual world overcomes fear, feelings of helplessness, despair and anxiety.* ***These are exactly the feelings that belong to contemporary culture and materialism because it estranges people from the spiritual world… to evoke hopelessness and fear of the unknown in people,*** *thereby calling up the above mentioned hostile forces against them.***”**

&#x200B;

This wasn't enough for me, I needed some scientific backing, after seaching long and hard I came across [this psychology study in the CIA FOIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000700760002-6.pdf)vault by clinical psychologist Juilka Kiskos and Andree Samuel

&#x200B;

**The Abstract Reads**:

*“Clinical Psychology has not taken into account evidence provided by other areas of research that point to the* ***existence of other levels of reality.*** *Therefore, that which is not perceived  through physical senses is often considered as being of a paranormal nature.* ***The authors have observed that in some psychological disorders sometimes there is an ESP factor mingled with the symptoms, and which are only taken into account as a proof of  ""insanity***"".

\-The entire study is dedicated to drawing a distinction between what doctors deem as “insanity” from actual clairvoyance experiences. The specific type of “insanity” we are going to cover for our purpose is the schizophrenia/”voices in your head” part of the study. These psychologists would employ “sensitives” or people with ESP to try and interact with these “voices” in some way. They turned out to be extremely successful and seemingly were performing ground breaking science that, unsurprisingly, we never heard about...

**Here are some direct quotes from the study**:

“*During the treatment of certain patients,* ***we came across extraneous personalities***\*. These were named “Theta Agents” because the circumstances in which they manifest themselves led us to conclude they were deceased persons.”\*

*“As a working hypothesis,* ***we consider that these entities exist in another level of reality or structure of their personality***\*, enabling us to understand and(page cuts off)”

**-There are 4 different groups of Theta Agents that they categorized. Only one of them matched up to the description consistently allotted to us by these ancient cultures previously mentioned.**

Category 3: “**Theta Agents induced to harm patients by means of black magic”**

[https://i.redd.it/g7zekqa6tmm31.png](https://i.redd.it/g7zekqa6tmm31.png)

***Now we are starting to get somewhere, The next place I looked for evidence turned out to be the more obvious one, with a lot more first hand accounts and expert testimonies… demonic possessions, which I previously believed were fiction.***

\-What many religions have called “demon/djinn/e’epa/etc. possessions” actually turns out to be a very similar if not identical condition as the malevolent “theta agent” described above.

**There is undoubtedly a demand for the services of Exorcists which has been legitimized by the Vatican**:

“In 1990, Father Amorth and five other officially appointed exorcists founded the International Association of Exorcists.By 2010, the organization numbered around 300 members from around the world, and although it was founded as an informal organization, the **Roman Catholic Church officially approved its statute in 2014**.”

\--**Father Gabriel Amorth did an** [exclusive interview on this topic](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/interview-with-an-exorcist--the-devil-and-father-amorth-69777) **which he required to be released only after he died, here are the highlights**:

**Q**: Can you contact these entities, what do they say?

**A**: ""Yes, through the patient, but in a strange, unnatural voice. If it is the Devil himself, he says 'I am Satan, or Lucifer, or Beelzebub. We ask if he is alone or if there are others with him. We ask when and how they entered that particular body. **We find out whether their presence is due to a spell and the specifics of that spell.**

**Q:** How do people come to be possessed by demons in the first place?

**A:** ""I believe God sometimes singles out certain souls for a special test of spiritual endurance, **but more often people lay themselves open to possession by dabbling with black magic. Some are entrapped by a satanic cult. Others are the victims of a curse.""**

\--If you do not want to take the word of someone with religious presuppositions and biases I completely understand, neither did I. So here are the highlights from a [Washington Post interview with Richard Gallagher](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/01/as-a-psychiatrist-i-diagnose-mental-illness-and-sometimes-demonic-possession/), a board-certified psychiatrist and a professor of clinical psychiatry at New York Medical College (studied psychology at Princeton, Yale, and Columbia) Here is what he had to say:

&#x200B;

""*As a man of reason, I’ve had to rationalize the seemingly irrational. Questions about how a scientifically trained physician can believe “such outdated and unscientific nonsense,” as I’ve been asked, have a simple answer*\*\*\*. I honestly weigh the evidence. I have been told simplistically that levitation defies the laws of gravity, and, well, of course it does! We are not dealing here with purely material reality, but with the spiritual realm. One cannot force these creatures to undergo lab studies or submit to scientific manipulation; they will also hardly allow themselves to be easily recorded by video equipment, as skeptics sometimes demand. *(The official Catholic Catechism* [*holds*](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm) *t****hat demons are sentient and possess their own wills***\*; as\* ***they are fallen angels, they are also craftier than humans. That’s how they sow confusion and seed doubt, after all.****)""*

""*But I believe I’ve seen the real thing. Assaults upon individuals are classified either as “demonic possessions” or as the slightly more common but less intense attacks usually called “oppressions.”* ***A possessed individual may suddenly, in a type of trance, voice statements of astonishing venom and contempt for religion, while understanding and speaking various foreign languages previously unknown to them. The subject might also exhibit enormous strength or even the extraordinarily rare phenomenon of levitation***\*. (I have not witnessed a levitation myself, but half a dozen people I work with vow that they’ve seen it in the course of their exorcisms.)\* ***He or she might demonstrate “hidden knowledge” of all sorts of things*** *— like how a stranger’s loved ones died, what secret sins she has committed, even where people are at a given moment. These are skills that cannot be explained except by special psychic or preternatural ability.*“

&#x200B;

* **While these expert accounts are extremely significant in their entirety, In order to keep this project moving forward in the direction I wanted, I focused on a specific aspect of these pieces of evidence: dark magic, spells, and devil worship.**

\---These mentions of dark occult practices seemed to be exactly the connection I was looking for to explain the evil nature of this international-mafia. They purposely create wars, disease, child killings/raping, because these are the greatest sources of the dark and negative emotions/energy that they feed off of. I will list the mentions of dark magic and occults below from the previous three sources:

&#x200B;

**CIA Psychology study**: “Theta Agents induced to harm patients by **means of black magic”**

**Father Gabriel Amorth:** “ people lay themselves open to possession by dabbling with **black magic**. Some are entrapped by a **satanic cult**. Others are the **victims of a curse**.""

**Richard Gallaghe**r: “In the late 1980s, I was introduced to a self-styled **Satanic high priestess**.. In our many discussions, she acknowledged worshipping Satan as her “queen.” **She could tell some people their secret weaknesses, such as undue pride. She knew how individuals she’d never known had died, including my mother and her fatal case of ovarian cancer. Six people later vouched to me that, during her exorcisms, they heard her speaking multiple languages, including Latin, completely unfamiliar to her outside of her trances.**

**Keynote**: The simple yet significant conclusion that can be drawn from these excerpts is the fact that these malevolent spiritual entities are not entirely random and out of control, **there exists people and groups with the spiritual capabilities/knowledge to wield these negative forces for personal gain.**

* ***What other motivation could there be for all of this unnecessary suffering created by these people? Like of course you could say 9/11 and military conflicts were created for the financial and power gains, you could say that the globally organized and universally protected sex trafficking of children is just because these people simply enjoy the thrill of abusing and molesting children, or the suppression of  world changing technology( e.g.Tesla free-energy) and cures for diseases is to prop up a future of their continual reign over the earth, etc. but thats not a good enough explanation for me at this point.  There are plenty of other ways for these people to go about their business while continue to control the world but there is a direct link between the agenda of these people and maximum suffering and pain. What else can explain these people’s obsession with symbolism and ritualistic behavior? What else can explain the Luciferian churches and celebrations that Ronald Bernard alluded to and I talked about in part I?***

\--Take this quote from life-long clairvoyant [Anton Steiger](https://www.antonstyger.ch/index.php/en/about-myself) an outspoken advocate for the metaphysical realm and esoteric nature of our existence:

*“When I see people in business or politics who are particularly trapped by the material world, for example, I notice that they no longer have any light bodies at all. In many of these people, the point of light at the heart chakra, which is otherwise always present, is no longer visible to me. Instead, I see something like a layer of ‘shiny tar’ around them in which a monstrous being in the shape of a lizard can be distinguished. When such people speak on television, for example, I see a crocodile shape manifesting itself around the person like in a concave mirror; I don’t see the light of their throat and forehead chakra.”*

&#x200B;

There is something different about these people, something inhuman, something immaterial. It’s time to wake up and realize that the material world is just a fraction of what we are meant to experience as humans. These elite fully understand this but use/hide this knowledge to serve the dark manifestations of spirituality through material control over every aspect of this world

But the results of PCR tests in Italy now clearly state  that since April, ""in agreement with the regional coordinating center, the detection of even a single SARS-CoV-2 target gene is interpreted as a POSITIVE test"" (see image below).

The analysis performed on the WTC steel by Professor Jonathan Barnett proves that it was attacked by some form of munition, since it was riddled with holes and had been severely eroded/melted by something containing high concentrations of sulfur.

**""The severe corrosion and subsequent erosion of samples 1 and 2 are a very unusual event. No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified.""**

http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf

**A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges--which are curled like a paper scroll--have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes--some larger than a silver dollar--let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending--but not holes.**

2) The hijackers’  VISA applications.

Investigating the attacks, political journal National Review obtained copies of the VISA applications for 15 of the 19 named hijackers, and in the process found that all 15 should have been refused entry to the country.

**""A new report accuses the State Department of staggering lapses in its visa program that gave Sept. 11 hijackers entry into the United States.**

**The political journal National Review obtained the visa applications for 15 of the 19 hijackers — and evidence that all of them should have been denied entry to the country.""**

3) Clairvoyance.

The former Pakistani foreign secretary claims he was told by top-level American officials at a UN meeting in July 2001, that military action would be taken against Afghanistan by October.

**""Niaz Naik, a former Pakistani Foreign Secretary, was told by senior American officials in mid-July that military action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of October.""**

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1550366.stm


4) Military grade munitions.

Professor Niels Harrit published a peer-reviewed paper in 2009 proving the existence of high-energy thermite residue in four out of four WTC samples.

5) The bin Laden ""confession tape"" is a demonstrable fraud.

**Professor Bruce Lawrence, head of Duke University's religious studies' department and the foremost Bin Laden expert, argues that the increasingly secular language in the video and audio tapes of Osama (his earliest ones are littered with references to God and the Prophet Mohammed) are inconsistent with his strict Islamic religion, Wahhabism.**
 
**He notes that, on one video, Bin Laden wears golden rings on his fingers, an adornment banned among Wahhabi followers.**

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1212851/Has-Osama-Bin-Laden-dead-seven-years--U-S-Britain-covering-continue-war-terror.html

**Urban dictionary: Magic Video Tape.**

**This is the VHS tape that was miraculously found by US troops in Afghanistan which contained an alleged confession by Osama bin Laden to be the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. He previously denied involvement so it was fortuitous that this tape was found in a country the size of Texas. The man in the video tape does not really look like bin Laden but the media has failed to point this out.**

6) Israeli intelligence were literally caught  “dancing in celebration”.

Amazing, but provable, and not quite as amazing as being caught and then let go.

**THERE was ruin and terror in Manhattan, but, over the Hudson River in New Jersey, a handful of men were dancing.**

**As the World Trade Centre burned and crumpled, the five men celebrated and filmed the worst atrocity ever committed on American soil as it played out before their eyes.**

**Who do you think they were? Palestinians? Saudis? Iraqis, even? Al-Qaeda, surely? Wrong on all counts. They were Israelis - and at least two of them were Israeli intelligence agents, working for Mossad, the equivalent of MI6 or the CIA.**

7) British university study confirms that 9/11 ""Conspiracy Theorists"" are the sane ones.

We all knew this anyway, but for what it's worth:-

**Recent studies by psychologists and social scientists in the US and UK suggest that contrary to mainstream media stereotypes, those labeled “conspiracy theorists” appear to be saner than those who accept the official versions of contested events.**

**The most recent study was published on July 8th by psychologists Michael J. Wood and Karen M. Douglas of the University of Kent (UK). Entitled “What about Building 7? A social psychological study of online discussion of 9/11 conspiracy theories,” the study compared “conspiracist” (pro-conspiracy theory) and “conventionalist” (anti-conspiracy) comments at news websites.**

**The authors were surprised to discover that it is now more conventional to leave so-called conspiracist comments than conventionalist ones: “Of the 2174 comments collected, 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalist.” In other words, among people who comment on news articles, those who disbelieve government accounts of such events as 9/11 and the JFK assassination outnumber believers by more than two to one. That means it is the pro-conspiracy commenters who are expressing what is now the conventional wisdom, while the anti-conspiracy commenters are becoming a small, beleaguered minority.**

8) Cheney likely gave a direct order not to shoot down flight 77.

The testimony of Norman Mineta before the 9/11 commission seems to suggest Cheney was kept aware of the path of flight 77 as it approached the Pentagon, and that he repeated an order not to shoot it down.

**MR. HAMILTON: We thank you for that. I wanted to focus just a moment on the Presidential Emergency Operating Center. You were there for a good part of the day. I think you were there with the vice president. And when you had that order given, I think it was by the president, that authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists, were you there when that order was given?**

**MR. MINETA: No, I was not. I was made aware of it during the time that the airplane coming into the Pentagon. There was a young man who had come in and said to the vice president, ""The plane is 50 miles out. The plane is 30 miles out."" And when it got down to, ""The plane is 10 miles out,"" the young man also said to the vice president, ""Do the orders still stand?"" And the vice president turned and whipped his neck around and said, ""Of course the orders still stand. Have you heard anything to the contrary?**

9) Who really gained?

Massive corporate contracts in a region which for the last 60 years had been pretty much off-limits to America because of the Cold War and the counter influence of the Soviet Union?

Most of Israel's enemies taken out of action and replaced with pro-US governments?

Come on. 

10) This.

Read both parts.

**A pilot who wrote a conspiracy theory book about 9/11 is dead after he shot his two teenage children and family dog before turning the gun on himself.**

**Micalia Phillips, 14, and her 17-year-old brother Alex, were also found dead at the home inside the gated Forrest Meadows community.**

**The former airline pilot's controversial conspiracy book The Big Bamboozle: 9/11 and the War on Terror was released last year.**

**While he was writing it, Marshall believed that his life was in danger because of the allegations involved.**

**According to Santa Barbara View, during the editing and pre-marketing process of Marshall’s book, he expressed some degree of paranoia because the nonfiction work accused the George W. Bush administration of being in cahoots with the Saudi intelligence community in training the hijackers who died in the planes used in the attacks.**

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2275258/Phillip-Marshall-Former-airline-pilot-conspiracy-theorist-shot-dead-teenage-children-dog-turning-gun-himself.html

**Investigative Reporter Finds Holes In Official Finding Of Murder-Suicide In California Death of 9/11 Author.**

**The 9/11 author who was found dead in his California home earlier this month was right-handed, but authorities determined that he shot himself in the left side of the head, a prominent investigative journalist reports.**

**The bodies of Phillip Marshall, his two children, and the family dog were found on February 2, and officials quickly determined it was a murder-suicide. But the Washington, D.C.-based Wayne Madsen Report (WMR) has found evidence that contradicts the official finding. WMR reports that Marshall might have possessed something in his Murphys, California, home that prompted someone to commit murder. Also, the community in Calaveras County is pushing for the sheriff's office to conduct a more thorough investigation.**

http://legalschnauzer.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/investigative-reporter-finds-holes-in.html

There are of course, probably 100 or more clues that this was a false flag attack, but I have focused on a few simply for brevity. Please feel free to add your own. For me, it begins and ends with the method used to bring down WTC 1 and 2. It is a scientific fact that the steel columns were attacked by some form of military thermite munition, which almost certainly eradicates al Qaeda from further inquiry into their collapses.

Please feel free to leave your opinions.

I'd even go as far to say the content posted on this sub daily is way more of ""dangerous information"" then a video (uploaded to YouTube and twitter) of a guy taping cardboard to window.

But it wasn't just me, the following week saw a flood of posts from people who's bans had just ended, complaining about being banned for talking about the election. There was a coordinated effort to sweep this sub of any wrong think while the ballots were still being counted.

I don't care what your politics are (I didn't vote) or whether you thought the election was legit or not, this should worry everyone. For starters the fact that they were seemingly prepared with a plan to remove anything questioning the narrative raises huge red flags. Theres also the issues of how much power and influence these forums have on the distribution of information.

Throughout the election (along with Covid and the riots) social media was weaponized to persuade/pressure you into believing that this is all normal, and simply questioning that makes you an evil person.

117,There was a massive amount of election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Primary. We've witnessed the coordinated installation of a nominee against the will of the people.,753.0,6f3t7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6f3t7n/there_was_a_massive_amount_of_election_fraud/,177.0,1496527455.0,"Whether you're a fan of Debbie Lusignan's commentary or not, she put together a very in-depth blog in real-time, state-by-state, chronicling massive amounts of election fraud. Everything's covered;

-Voter Roll Purging (State by state... see Brooklyn alone, where over 125,000 people were seemingly kicked off the rolls. This nationwide phenomenon was almost entirely exclusive to potential Sanders voters.)

-Unsolicited Party Affiliation Switching (Lifelong Dems being switched to Lib, Repub, or Independent in closed primaries by the thousands. In one of the more eggregious primaries, AZ, their SOS even testified under oath that this had occured in unprecedented numbers. As above, this phenomenon was almost entirely exclusive to Sanders voters.)

-Caucus Rigging (The shenanigans in Iowa and especially NV should have caused more outrage than they did.)

-Absentee Ballot Stuffing (See Wyoming and Montanta for extreme examples of this.)

-Unparalleled Precinct Slashing (This occurred in many states with once again AZ being a prime example. Polling locations were cut to record lows. Lines stretched into the thousands and wait times were documented to be upwards of 4-6 hours in certain counties.)

-Auditing Anomolies (See the results and testimony before the Election Board following the Chicago micro-audit.)

Historic Exit Poll Discrepancies (In 12 states, the discrepancies were well outside of the margin of error and in some cases in the double-digits. These discrepancies were almost entirely exclusive to the Sanders/Clinton race, with everything else matching up within the margin of error as expected. Look at the difference between the exit polls in the Republican Primary versus the Democratic... it's night and day. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that after the exit poll anamolies started to gain serious traction, they were eliminated in each state for the remainder of the primary. Independent exit polls were conducted in the states where official ones were cancelled and often showed massive discrepancies in regards to the official outcome... see CA.)

-Voter Database Breaches (This happened during a few key points pre-primary and during; the AZ breach being the most significant. Though unproven, many election integrity activists theorize that this is the means in which probable Sanders voters were unmasked and targeted for roll purges and affiliation switches.)

-Electronic Voting Machines (Ever since HBO's Hacking Democracy expose aired and bolstered recently by the work of Bev Harris at blackboxvoting dot org, the continued use of electronic voting machines, many of which have been banned in Europe at this point, is highly irresponsible. These machines have proven to be susceptible to remote hacking and provide no paper trail. In fact, there is proprietary software built into the machines themselves with the sole purpose of fractionally weighting the votes to meet a predetermined outcome. See Bev Harris' Fraction Magic mini-doc on youtube to see this exposed in real time. Whether or not this exploitiation was employed is up for debate, but by design this software leaves no evidentiary paper trail, making confirmation one way or the other next to impossible.

Then there is the outright underhandedness. While not necessarily fraud, ethics and fairness do come into serious question.

-Everything in the Wikileaks DNC and Podesta dumps. (This has all been thoroughly covered here.)

-Historically Minimal Debate Schedule (DNC originally only sanctioned 6 debates. Sanders/Clinton ended up having 9, but compare that to 08' when Clinton/Obama faced off 26 times.)

-Near Media Blackout for Sanders during 2015 and into 2016. (In terms of minutes of pre-primary MSN news coverage an estimated 327 minutes went to Trump, 121 minutes to Clinton, and a mere 20 minutes for Sanders despite his surging momentum.)

-Media Bias (To say that the MSM wasn't in the tank for Clinton would be the understatement of the year. See The Washington Compost's 16 hit pieces they ran in one day leading up to Super Tuesday II. Not to mention the media and pundit collusion well documented in the Wikileaks dumps.)

-Closed Primaries (Despite 42% of the nation being registered Indies, the duopoly remains king. Many of the state caucuses and primaries excluded participation from the largest voting block in America. Coincidentally, left and even some right leaning Independents were far more likely to support Sanders than Clinton... go figure. In many states, first time registrants and those who wished to switch party affilation were required to do so months before voting took place. Naive first time voter were often victim to these regulations; again a youth block that would have overwhelmingly voted for Sanders. In NY for example, this was required months and months before voting took place, even before the first televised debates during which Sanders was experiencing a near media blackout. States that held ""open"" primaries were riddled with provisional ballot fuckery; see CA.

-Super Delegates (The fact that we willfully accept the notion that the vote of indivduals in positions of power count for much more than ours is baffling to me. It's this entirely undemocratic process that saw Clinton walk away with the same amount of pledged delegates as Sanders in a state like Wyoming that healthily won; with SD's included, Clinton walked away from that state, in a losing effort, with an 11 to 7 delegate advantage. Though this ties into media bias, it's worth mentioning that in nearly all MSM coverage, SD's were lumped in with pledged delegates whenever totals were presented to the public, even though SD's didn't cast their votes until the convention. To new and low-information constituents, this deceptive reporting gave the impression that Clinton's lead was always more significant than it actually was; this was done for the seemingly sole purpose of demoralizing the Sanders voting block and stifle upward momentum. As Al Franken pointed out, he felt that due to his political experience he knew what was best for his constituents and would cast his SD vote for Clinton despite his state going for Sanders. Franken was just one of many Reps and Senators that gave the middle finger to the will of their constituency.

-Rallies (Though this is more of a speculative side topic, it can't be ignored. From August 15' through June of 16', even when Sanders had no delegate path to victory, his rallies were attended by hundreds of thousands of indivuals, often filling stadiums to maximum capacity. In contrast, HRC could barely fill a broom closet, let alone a high school gymnasium. Sure, she had a handful of decent turnouts early on, but those number dwindled as the primary carried on, while Sanders' numbers surged in every conceivable way. In one her final rallies in L.A., there were more people protesting outside than HRC supporters inside. Looking at the gross disparity here, something just doesn't pass the smell test.

TL;DR - There was election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Primary, likely massive, if not an outright coup.

 Stocked up before everyone panicked and many family members thought I was crazy when I warned them way before March 2020. Then I saw what was coming to the virus, the lockdowns, and the riots were meant to divide and take down America, the symbol of freedom to this world. I poured my heart and soul for the 2020 campaign then volunteered for the election integrity team...was it enough fraud to change the election, I don't think so here in Nevada but I uncovered multiple ballots being sent to many people and spoke to so many people that experienced voter irregularity.

 Then the push for the vaccine and the new normal from the government and celebrities, I just want to wake up from this nightmare. The vaccine talk and also the media shoving fear to older people, including my parents, its been nonstop I don't want to hear about it anymore. I haven't seen my parents in over a year and a half because they are living in fear....meanwhile me and my husband we didn't stop living in fear this whole time. 

I just don't get it anymore, why are we all awake and called crazy as critical thinkers, who read into conspiracies when we know there's something darker and sinister trying to control and depopulate the world. This feeling of being overwhelmed and depressed that the world is in chaos.

I even talked to my father-in-law today about the grand solar minimum how it's a natural cycle of the sun and the strange extreme weather is all connected to the sun cycle. 

  
Who else is struggling with their mental health knowing the truth of what's going on? If you asked me a year ago prior to March 2020, I had so much hope for the future outlook now I don't...I turned off the news but the propaganda of listening to either my parents or other friends mentioning the virus and vaccine...I am just so over this.",conspiracy,fraud

What happened? I was banned by the admins last Monday for 7 days (the day before the election). [I made a thread on voat](https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/4105790) about the situation a few days ago, but it likely went unnoticed here due to the lack of cross-pollination between these communities.

In the future, if anything happens to my account, I’ll communicate to you on [v/conspiracy](https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy) as soon as I can. Also, *get on alternative social media immediately*. Big Tech has shown its true colors in unbelievably diabolical fashion, and we *must* wrest control of the internet back from these forces.

As detailed in that voat thread, I'm *guessing* the ban was related to my use of archive.org to share links of certain urls, specifically zerohedge and gatewaypundit, which were added to reddit’s site-wide domain ban just before the election.

Since I had seen multiple instances of users submitting *archived* links of these specific domains, and with no repercussions from the admins, I assumed that this was condoned (as long as no TOS violations were included in the archived link, obviously).

Interestingly, *none* of my links (or comments!) were actually removed by the admins, which is why I’m only speculating about the purported reason for the ban.

I *do* know that certain factions habitually mass-report everything I do or say, hoping to trigger admin action.

Here’s how I see it: *reddit effectively neutered the head moderator of arguably the largest “controversial” community left standing on reddit (and one of the largest ""conspiracy"" forums on the internet), on the eve of what is turning out to be the most contentious election in US history.* 

In addition, I received no warning, and was given zero opportunity to contact my fellow mods (I've never been banned in over a decade on reddit).

Here’s the reality: I was elected by the community many years ago to be a moderator due to a vast array of OC that I routinely churned out for the sole benefit of /r/conspiracy. 

I was *also* unanimously elected by the r/conspiracy mod team to take over the top spot, to which the admins obliged. We frequently discuss and vote before making major decisions on the sub, and I’m there to break the tie and make other important calls. 

The admins should have afforded me an explanation for the 7-day ban, and at the *very* least allowed me to contact my fellow moderators. 

On the plus side, I *was* given an unexpected opportunity to step away from reddit for a bit so I could *really* take in the unprecedented events of the last week.

As mentioned in my voat thread, the following isn’t meant as a slight to the mods here, who are literally indefatigable and all do their part. But one of my most important roles as /r/conspiracy mod is to combat what we call the “bad actors” who aim to discredit, mock, and silence us completely. From what I’ve observed over the last week, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to suggest that my presence here has been greatly missed.

Over time, when I realized these bad actors were spending considerable effort hounding me, I decided I would respond in kind (and then some). tbh I’d rather spend my time researching the occult/esoteric, but this seems to be my role for the moment, so whatever.

Where does that leave us? ...certainly at a crossroads for humanity, and that should be glaringly apparent by now. The writing has been on the wall for a long while, but it was a fucking Jackson Pollock painting in the weeks leading up to the election. 

The veil of the legacy media has finally been lifted. A line has been drawn, and even world leaders are picking sides. 

*Now* we know why alternative media channels and voices were systematically purged before the election. 

*Now* we know why Big Tech firmly cemented its ability to “fact check” at its whim before the election.

...and *now* we know why “COVID” was used to upend the fabric of society for the ""Great Reset"" and then ridiculously morphed into a partisan issue and used as a framework to fundamentally alter the US electoral process.

IF the US election was compromised, we MUST be able to investigate and *yes, speculate*. And that INCLUDES suggesting things that *don't have a source and that we might actually be wrong about*. 

If we’re wrong, then great, but we MUST be afforded the opportunity to DISCUSS these possibilities in the modern public square, aka social media.

The fact that they are **systematically eliminating our ability to do so** should be setting off HUGE red flags for even those who are barely paying attention (at least one can only hope). 

The *entire* point of this place (and conspiracy theories in general!) is to talk about stuff that **might not be true**. That’s the fun of it. Despite the biased mainstream narrative, the ""conspiracy theorists"" are usually the *first* to spot the disinfo, because *we're* the ones who spend our time studying this stuff in the first place!

And yet, there are these institutions and individuals whose sole intent appears to be to mock and prevent us from mere speculation. Is this organic? Is it genuine? Not even close. 

IF systematic fraud during this election is uncovered and confirmed, it would be treasonous. **And those preventing us from discussing and exposing this information would be in direct support of outright criminal activity.**

They don’t want us to stop talking because sometimes we’re wrong, **they want us to stop talking because sometimes we’re right.**

Things are different now. The world has changed forever, and everybody feels it. They’ve upped their game, and so will we. 

I’m not going to post as much anymore, lest some spurious technicality gets mass reported and they decide to neuter my account again. However, I refuse to allow r/conspiracy to succumb to the propaganda that appears to quite literally be engulfing all of Western Civilization as we know it, and that's not even hyperbole. 

This is a call to action--digital action--but also action in our own personal lives. Humanity’s timeline appears to be branching into two directions, one that cherishes freedom, creativity and the individual, and one that seeks absolute conformity, compliance and control. 

These are the times that try men’s souls.

Presumed President-elect Joe Biden celebrated as the victor  of the election on Saturday and said he will work to unite the country.  

“I’m humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I  pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify. Who  doesn’t see red states or blue states, but only the United States,” he  said.

Ted Cruz, however, joined Fox’s Maria Bartiromo on Sunday](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/count-every-single-legal-vote-that-was-cast-ted-cruz-says-trump-still-has-a-path-to-victory)  and said that President Trump could still win the 2020 election amid  his legal battles in states such as Georgia and Pennsylvania. 

“Historically, mail-in votes are much more likely to be  disqualified in a recount than in-person votes. Generally, in-person  votes — they’re conducted at the polling place, and they usually stand.  That means what we’re likely to see in the next few weeks as the  recounts go forward is that Joe Biden’s very, very narrow majorities in  some of these states, those totals are likely to drop if we see mail-in  votes when they’re examined being invalidated as contrary to the law,”  Cruz said.

He  added that he believes Trump “still has a path to victory, and that  path is to count every single legal vote that was cast, but also not to  count any votes that were fraudulently cast or illegally cast.”",conspiracy,fraud

The HPV vaccine Gardasil was granted European license in February 2006,1 followed by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval that same year in June.2  Gardasil was controversial in the U.S. from the beginning, with vaccine  safety activists questioning the quality of the clinical trials used to  fast track the vaccine to licensure.3

Lauded as a silver bullet against cervical cancer, there have been multiple continuing reports since it was licensed that [Gardasil vaccine](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/05/05/hpv-vaccine-gardasil.aspx)  has wrought havoc on the lives of young girls (and young boys) in the  U.S. and in countries across the world. Serious adverse reactions  reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in  relation to Gardasil include but are not limited to:4

 

* Anaphylaxis
* Guillain-Barre Syndrome
* [Transverse myelitis](https://articles.mercola.com/shingles.aspx) (inflammation of the spinal cord)
* [Pancreatitis](https://articles.mercola.com/pancreatitis.aspx)
* Venous thromboembolic events (blood clots)
* Autoimmune initiated motor neuron disease (a neurodegenerative disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness)
* [Multiple sclerosis](https://articles.mercola.com/multiple-sclerosis.aspx)
* Sudden death

 

Postmarketing experiences and adverse events reported during post-approval use listed on the Gardasil vaccine insert5  include blood and lymphatic system disorders such as autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and  lymphadenopathy; pulmonary embolus; pancreatitis; autoimmune diseases;  anaphylactic reactions; arthralgia and myalgia (musculoskeletal and  connective tissue disorders); nervous system disorders such as acute  disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, motor neuron  disease, paralysis, seizures and transverse myelitis; and deep venous  thrombosis, a vascular disorder.

According to ""Manufactured Crisis — HPV, Hype and Horror,"" a film6  by The Alliance for Natural Health, there have also been cases of  16-year-old girls developing ovarian dysfunction, meaning they're going  into menopause, which in turn means they will not be able to have  children.

Despite such serious effects, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) and FDA allege the vast majority, or even all, of  these tragic cases are unrelated to the vaccine, and that Gardasil is  safe.

The Plaintiff's Science Day Presentation on Gardasil video features  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children's  Health Defense,7  an organization originally founded in 2016 as World Mercury Project and  renamed in 2018 to focus on exposing and eliminating multiple harmful  exposures contributing to the epidemic of chronic ill health among  children. The video details the many safety problems associated with  Merck's HPV vaccine, Gardasil.

The information presented is based on publicly available government documents. Kennedy notes that, if what he says about [Merck](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/05/14/mercks-adhd-drugs-unsafe.aspx) in this video presentation were untrue, they would be considered slanderous.

However, Kennedy says he is not concerned about being sued for  slander. He says he knows Merck won't sue, ""because in the U.S., truth  is an absolute defense against slander"" and Merck knows that, were the  company to sue for slander, Kennedy would file discovery requests that  would unearth even more documents detailing Merck's fraudulent  activities.

Kennedy's presentation does not go into the biological mechanisms by  which Gardasil causes harm. He directs parents and pediatricians to the  Children's Health Defense website8 to read peer reviewed medical literature sources for that information.

Instead, Kennedy's presentation focuses on what he describes as  Merck's fraudulent clinical trials of Gardasil vaccine, which were used  to gain FDA approval. While this article provides you with a summary of  the key points, I urge you to watch Kennedy's presentation in in its  entirety, as this information may well save you or your child a lifetime  of heartache and exorbitant medical expenses.

 

## How Merck committed fraud in its Gardasil safety testing 

Kennedy says the fraud Merck committed in its safety testing is (a)  testing Gardasil against a toxic placebo, and (b) hiding a 2.3%  incidence of autoimmune disease occurring within seven months of  vaccination.

In his presentation, Kennedy shows Table 1 from the package insert9  for Gardasil, which looks at vaccine injuries at the site of injection.  It shows that Gardasil was administered to 5,088 girls; another 3,470  received the control, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (AAAH)  — a neurotoxic aluminum vaccine adjuvant that has been associated with  many serious vaccine injuries in the medical literature.

A third group, consisting of 320 individuals, received a proper [placebo](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/02/20/placebo-effect.aspx)  (saline). In the Gardasil and AAAH control groups, the number of  injuries were fairly close; 83.9% in the Gardasil group and 75.4% in the  AAAH control group. Meanwhile, the rate of injury (again, relating to  injuries at the injection site only), was significantly lower at 48.6%.

Next, he shows Table 9 from the vaccine insert, which is the ""Summary  of girls and women 9 through 26 years of age who reported an incident  condition potentially indicative of a systemic autoimmune disorder after  enrollment in clinical trials of Gardasil, regardless of causality.""  These conditions include serious systemic reactions, chronic and  debilitating disorders and autoimmune diseases.

Now all of a sudden, there are only two columns, not three as shown  for the injection site injuries. The column left out is that of the  saline placebo group. Kennedy points out that Merck cleverly hides the  hazards of Gardasil by combining the saline group with the aluminum  control, thereby watering down the side effects reported in the  controls. ""They hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your  pediatrician and the regulatory agency,"" Kennedy says.

Looking at the effects reported in the two groups, 2.3% of those  receiving Gardasil reported an effect of this nature, as did 2.3% of  those receiving the AAAH (aluminum) control or saline placebo. The same  exact ratio of harm is reported in both groups, which makes it appear as  though Gardasil is harmless.

In reality, we know very little about Gardasil vaccine safety from  the data as presented, since the vast majority of the controls were  given a toxic substance, and they don't tell us how many of those  receiving a truly inert substance developed these systemic injuries.  Still, we can draw some educated guesses, seeing how the injection site  injury ratios between Gardasil and the aluminum group were similar.

Merck's use of AAAH, a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a  biologically inactive placebo, effectively nullifies its prelicensure  Gardasil safety testing.

As noted by Peter Gotzche with the Cochrane Center in 2016, when he  co-filed an unofficial complaint against the European Medical Agency for  bias in its assessment of the HPV vaccine, ""The use of active  comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms in the comparator  group, thereby masking harms caused by the HPV vaccine.""

## Risk evaluation

When making an informed decision, you need to know both sides of the  equation — the risk you're trying to avoid, and the risk you're taking  on. Recall that, on average, 1 in 43,478 women will die from cervical  cancer.

If 2.3% of girls develop an autoimmune disease from Gardasil, then  that translates into 1,000 per 43,500. Even if a 1 in 43,478 chance of  dying from cancer is gone, does it makes sense to trade that for a 1 in  43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease?

And how many parents are comfortable giving a child a substance  knowing there's a 1 in 43 chance that this substance will cause a  lifelong disability? Yet that's the choice parents have been fooled into  making.

## Protocol 18

Merck has not disclosed how many clinical safety trials (also called  protocols) it conducted for Gardasil. A slide in Kennedy's presentation  shows a listing of several of the ones known, including protocol 18.  Kennedy says this clinical trial is critical because that was the one  that FDA used as its basis for giving Merck a license to market the  vaccine for use in children as young as 9 years old.

Protocol 18 is the only trial in which the target audience, 9-  through 15-year-old girls and boys, was tested prelicensure. The other  trials looked at the vaccine's safety in 16- through 26-year-olds.  Protocol 18 included just 939 children — ""a very, very tiny group of  people,"" Kennedy says, ""for a product that is going to be marketed to  millions of children around the world.""

Aside from its small cohort size, protocol 18 is also filled with  ""fraud and flimflam,"" according to Kennedy. Merck presented protocol 18  to the FDA and HHS as the only safety trial that used a true  nonbioactive inert placebo. This, however, was a misrepresentation.

Instead of pure saline, the placebo used in protocol 18 contained a carrier solution composed of [polysorbate 80](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/02/07/processed-food-emulsifiers-health-risks.aspx),  sodium borate (borax, which is banned for food products in the U.S. and  Europe), genetically modified yeast, L-histidine and DNA fragments. In  essence, the ""placebo"" was all of the vaccine components with the  exception of the aluminum adjuvant and the antigen (viral portion).

Very little if any safety testing has been done on these ingredients,  so their biological effects in the body are largely unknown. What we  can say for sure is that these are not inert substances like saline.  Still, the 596 children given the carrier solution control ""fared much  better than any other cohort in the study,"" Kennedy says.

None of them had any serious adverse events in the first 15 days.  Now, here's where Merck committed fraud yet again. As Kennedy points  out, Table 20 in protocol 18 shows that Merck cut the amount of aluminum  used in the Gardasil vaccine by half.

>*""They tested a completely different formulation,""* he says*.  ""And, obviously, they took the amount of aluminum out to reduce the  amount of injuries and mask the really bad safety profile of this  vaccine …*  
>  
>*Since Merck deceptively cut the amount of aluminum — Gardasil's  most toxic component — in half, the data from that study does not  support the safety of the standard Gardasil formulation. Since protocol  18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial  constitutes scientific fraud.""*  
 

## Exclusion criteria — Another bag of tricks

Kennedy also describes another trick used by Merck to skew results:  exclusion criteria. By selecting trial participants that do not reflect  the general population, they mask potentially injurious effects on  vulnerable subgroups.

For example, individuals with severe allergies and prior genital  infections were excluded, as were those who'd had more than four sex  partners, those with a history of immunological or nervous system  disorders, chronic illnesses, seizure disorders, other medical  conditions, reactions to vaccine ingredients such as aluminum, yeast and  benzonase, and anyone with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.

Yet Merck recommends Gardasil for all of these unstudied groups.  Merck's investigators also had unlimited discretion to exclude anyone  with ""any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might  interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.""

Merck also used ""sloppy protocols to suppress reports of vaccine  injury,"" Kennedy says. For example, only 10% of participants were given  daily report cards to fill out, and they were only to be filled out for  14 days post-vaccination. What's more, these report cards only collected  information about vaccination site effects, such as redness, itching  and bruising.

Also ignored were autoimmune problems, seizures and menstrual cycle  disruptions experienced by many of the girls. They also did not follow  up with those who reported serious side effects. Merck also granted  broad discretionary powers to its paid investigators to determine what  they thought constituted a reportable adverse event and to dismiss  potential vaccine reactions.

The researchers did not systematically collect adverse event data,  which is the whole point of doing a safety study in the first place, and  by not paying for the additional time required by investigators to fill  out time-consuming adverse event reports, Merck effectively  incentivized the dismissal of side effects.

Many of the illnesses and injuries reported were also classified as  ""new medical conditions"" rather than adverse events, and no rigorous  investigation of these new conditions were performed.

According to Kennedy, at the time of the vaccine's approval, 49.5% of  the Gardasil group and 52% of the controls (who received either the  aluminum adjuvant or the vaccine carrier solution) had ""new medical  history"" after the seventh month (Table 303, which included protocols 7,  13, 15 and 18), many of which were serious, chronic diseases.

## Risk evaluation, take 2

**Taking all of this into account, here's how the risk-benefit equation  looks now: The 1 in 43,478 chance of dying from cervical cancer may  have been removed (assuming the vaccine actually works), but by taking  the vaccine there is now a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune  disease, and a 1 in 2 chance of developing some form of serious medical  condition.**

## More lies 

According to Kennedy, Merck also submitted fraudulent information to its Worldwide Adverse Experience System and the federal Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) about the death of Christina Tarsell, one of its study participants.

>*""Merck claimed that Chris' gynecologist had told the company that her death was due to viral infection. Chris' gynecologist denies that she ever gave this information to Merck. To this day, Merck has refused to change its false entry on its own reporting system,""* Kennedy says.  
>  
>*""Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls participating in these studies, telling them that the placebo was saline and contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe …*   
>  
>*They made it so that the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine, because they believed the vaccine they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries did experience, maybe a month, two months or three months after the vaccine must just be coincidental and had nothing to do with the  vaccine.""*

 

But it gets worse, because there's a possibility Gardasil could cause cancer. The Gardasil insert13  admits it has never been evaluated for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity,  yet its ingredients ""include potential carcinogens and mutagens,  including aluminum and human DNA,"" Kennedy says.

He goes on to show the results of Merck's study protocol 13 (Table  17: Applicant's analysis of efficacy against vaccine-relevant HPV types  CIN 2/3 or worse among subjects who were PCR positive and seropositive  for relevant HPV types at day 1.)

What this protocol showed is that women who had previous exposure to  the HPV strains used in the vaccine had a 44.6% increased risk of  developing CIN2 and CIN3 lesions after vaccination. Taking the dubious  efficacy of Gardasil into account, and the fact that it may only impact  one-third of cervical cancer cases, the risk-benefit lineup when taking  the vaccine now looks like this:

&#x200B;

* There is still a chance of dying from cervical cancer unrelated to HPV 
* There is a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease
* There is a 1 in 2 chance of developing a serious medical condition
* If someone has ever been exposed to any of the nine HPV strains  included in the vaccine prior to getting Gardasil the risk of developing  CIN2 and CIN3 cervical lesions is raised by 44.6%, which may raise the  risk of cervical cancer

## Widespread Gardasil use may trigger more virulent HPV infections 

""To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that  suggest a phenomenon known as type replacement,"" Kennedy says. ""Type  replacement"" refers to when the elimination or suppression of one viral  strain allows a more virulent strain to colonize. 

The study,14  ""Shift in Prevalence of HPV Types in Cervical Cytology Specimens in the  Era of HPV Vaccination,"" published in the journal Oncology Letters in  2016 — which analyzed the association between the prevalence of 32 types  of HPV virus in 615 women who had abnormal cervical cytopathology —  reported that:

>*""… HPV16, which is recognized as the main HR-HPV type responsible  for the development of cervical cancer, was observed in 32.98% of HPV  participants, followed by HPV42 (18.09%), HPV31 (17.66%), HPV51  (13.83%), HPV56 (10.00%), HPV53 (8.72%) and HPV66 (8.72%).*   
>  
>*The prevalence of HR-HPV types, which may be suppressed directly  (in the case of HPV16 and 18), or possibly via cross-protection (in the  case of HPV31) following vaccination, was considerably lower in  participants ≤22 years of age (HPV16, 28.57%; HPV18, 2.04%; HPV31,  6.12%), compared with participants 23–29 years of age (HPV16, 45.71%;  HPV18, 7.86%; HPV31, 22.86%), who were less likely to be vaccinated.*   
>  
>*Consequently, the present study hypothesizes that there may be a  continuous shift in the prevalence of HPV types as a result of  vaccination. Furthermore, the percentage of non-vaccine HR-HPV types was  higher than expected, considering that eight HPV types formerly  classified as 'low-risk' or 'probably high-risk' are in fact HR-HPV  types.*   
>  
>*Therefore, it may be important to monitor non-vaccine HPV types  in future studies, and an investigation concerning several HR-HPV types  as risk factors for the development of cervical cancer is required.""*

GoldenUndergroundTV recently released an interview I did with them late last year. I got a bit animated at the end. Only so many interviews in a row I could handle being asked about Chief Keef.

My tirade wasn’t really about Chief Keef. It wasn’t about Gucci Mane or Wocka Flocka or any of the acts spontaneously catapulted into stardom by synchronized mass media coverage despite seemingly universal indifference (at the very best) regarding their talent. Whose arrests, involvement in underaged pregnancies, concert shootouts, and facial tattoos, dominate conversation for weeks at a time, with their actual music a mere afterthought, if thought of at all.

My tirade was about marketing. It was about media powers seeking out the biggest pretend criminal kingpins they can find, (many of whom who shamelessly adopt the names of actual real life criminal kingpins like 50 Cent and Rick Ross), and exalting them as the poster children for a culture. It was about an art form reduced to product placement, the selling of a lifestyle, and ultimately, a huge ad for imprisonment.

This is not my opinion.

Last year Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), the biggest name in the private prison industry, contacted 48 states offering to buy their prisons. One stipulation of eligibility for the deal was particularly bizarre: “an assurance by the agency partner that the agency has sufficient inmate population to maintain a minimum 90% occupancy rate over the term of the contract.

What kind of legitimate and ethical measures could possibly be taken to ensure the maintenance of a 90% prison occupancy rate?

Two months later an anonymous email was sent out to various members of the music and publishing industries giving an account of a meeting where it was determined that hip-hop music would be manipulated to drive up privatized prison profits. Its author, despite claiming to be a former industry insider, did not provide the names of anyone involved in the plot, nor did he specify by which company he himself was employed. As such, the letter was largely regarded as a fraud for lack of facts.

Ninety percent of what Americans read, watch and listen to is controlled by only six media companies. PBS’s Frontline has described the conglomerates that determine what information is disseminated to the public as a “web of business relationships that now defines America’s media and culture.” Business relationships. Last year a mere 232 media executives were responsible for the intake of 277 million Americans, controlling all the avenues necessary to manufacture any celebrity and incite any trend. Time Warner, as owner of Warner Bros Records (among many other record labels), can not only sign an artist to a recording contract but, as the owner ofEntertainment Weekly, can see to it that they get next week’s cover. Also the owner of New Line Cinemas, HBO and TNT, they can have their artist cast in a leading role in a film that, when pulled from theaters, will be put into rotation first on premium, then on basic, cable. Without any consideration to the music whatsoever, the artist will already be a star, though such monopolies also extend into radio stations and networks that air music videos. For consumers, choice is often illusory. Both BET and MTV belong to Viacom. While Hot 97, NYC’s top hip hop station, is owned by Emmis Communications, online streaming is controlled by Clear Channel, who also owns rival station Power 105.

None of this is exactly breaking news, but when ownership of these media conglomerates is cross checked with ownership of the biggest names in prison privatization, interesting new facts emerge.

According to public analysis from Bloomberg, the largest holder in Corrections Corporation of America is Vanguard Group Incorporated. Interestingly enough, Vanguard also holds considerable stake in the media giants determining this country’s culture. In fact, Vanguard is the third largest holder in both Viacom and Time Warner. Vanguard is also the third largest holder in the GEO Group, whose correctional, detention and community reentry services boast 101 facilities, approximately 73,000 beds and 18,000 employees. Second nationally only to Corrections Corporation of America, GEO’s facilities are located not only in the United States but in the United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa.

You may be thinking, “Well, Vanguard is only the third largest holder in those media conglomerates, which is no guarantee that they’re calling any shots.” Well, the number-one holder of both Viacom and Time Warner is a company called Blackrock. Blackrock is the second largest holder in Corrections Corporation of America, second only to Vanguard, and the sixth largest holder in the GEO Group.

There are many other startling overlaps in private-prison/mass-media ownership, but two underlying facts become clear very quickly: The people who own the media are the same people who own private prisons, the EXACT same people, and using one to promote the other is (or “would be,” depending on your analysis) very lucrative.

Such a scheme would mean some very greedy, very racist people.

There are facts to back that up, too.

Prison industry lobbyists developing and encouraging criminal justice policies to advance financial interests has been well-documented. The most notorious example is the Washington-based American Legislative Council, a policy organization funded by CCA and GEO, which successfully championed the incarceration promoting “truth in sentencing” and “three-strikes” sentencing laws. If the motive of the private prison industry were the goodhearted desire to get hold of inmates as quickly as possible for the purpose of sooner successfully rehabilitating them, maintenance of a 90% occupancy rate would be considered a huge failure, not a functioning prerequisite.

Likewise, the largest rise in incarceration that this country has ever seen correlates precisely with early-80’s prison privatization. This despite the fact that crime rates actually declined since this time. This decreasing crime rate was pointed out enthusiastically by skeptics eager to debunk last year’s anonymous industry insider, who painted a picture of popularized hip-hop as a tool for imprisoning masses. What wasn’t pointed out was that despite crime rates going down, incarceration rates have skyrocketed. While the size of the prison population changed dramatically, so did its complexion. In “‘All Eyez on Me’: America’s War on Drugs and the Prison-Industrial Complex,” Andre Douglas Pond Cummings documents the obvious truth that “the vast majority of the prisoner increase in the United States has come from African-American and Latino citizen drug arrests.”

Add to this well-documented statistics proving that the so-called “war on drugs” has been waged almost entirely on low-income communities of color, where up until just two years ago, cocaine sold in crack form fetched sentences 100 times as lengthy as the exact same amount of cocaine sold in powdered form, which is much more common in cocaine arrests in affluent communities. (In July 2010 the oddly named Fair Sentencing Act was adopted, which, rather than reducing the crack/powder disparity from 100-to-1 to 1-to-1, reduced it to 18-to-1, which is still grossly unfair.) This is not to suggest that the crack/powder disparity represents the extent of the racism rampant within the incarceration industry. The U.S. Sentencing Commission reported in March 2010 that in the federal prison system, even where convicted for the exact same crimes, people of color received prison sentences 10% longer . Where convictions are identical, mandatory minimum sentences are also 21% more likely for people of color.

Finally, let us not forget the wealth of evidence to support the notion that crime-, drug- and prison-glorifying hip-hop only outsells other hip-hop because it receives so much more exposure and financial backing, and that when given equal exposure, talent is a much more reliable indicator of success than content.

Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def) put it best; “‘hip-hop” is just shorthand for ‘black people.'” Before our eyes and ears, a “web of business relationships that now defines America’s media and culture” has one particular business raking in billions of dollars while another defines the culture of a specific demographic as criminal. Both business are owned by the same people. Mainstream media continue to endorse hip-hop that glorifies criminality (most notably drug trafficking and violence), and private prison interests, long since proven to value profits over human rights, usher in inmates of color to meet capacity quotas. The same people disproportionately incarcerated when exposed to the criminal justice system are at every turn inundated with media normalizing incarceration to the point that wherever there is mainstream hip-hop music, reference to imprisonment as an ordinary, even expected, component of life is sure to follow.

Conspiracy theorists get a lot of flak for daring entertain the notion that people will do evil things for money. Historical atrocities like slavery and the Holocaust are universally acknowledged, yet simultaneously adopted is the contradictory position that there can’t possibly be any human beings around intelligent enough and immoral enough to perpetrate such things. Even in the midst of the Europe-wide beef that was actually horse-meat fiasco, and the release of real-life nightmare documenting films like “Sunshine and Oranges,” there is an abundance of people content to believe that the only conspiracies that ever exist are those that have successfully been exposed.

The link between mass media and the prison industrial complex, however, is part of a very different type of conversation.

Be aware that doctors believe that less than 1% of vaccine damage is ever reported:

“The doctors emphasize how “fewer than 1% percent of vaccine adverse events are even reported. So, theoretically, that 1/39 number \[2.6% vaccine damage previously estimated\] discovered from the data mentioned above is actually a lot greater given the fact that many adverse events aren’t even reported.

Of all the threats we’re facing right now, I consider the mRNA “vaccine” to be the most pressing and immediate.

Where in all of the MSM is any semblance of informed consent? This wilful ignorance like a spell over it and the people who consume it is sickening and most probably criminal.

While, disappointingly, most still believe in the COVID psyop, I believe there is an instinctual revulsion and mistrust surrounding vaccines in general and the mRNA treatments specifically. Rather like the U.K. and its initial implicit belief that the royal family had a hand in Princess Diana’s death, we KNOW something is wrong with this picture. Most would prefer to wait, despite being told vaccines are the only possible ransom/ parole for their current captivity. Calling this mad scramble “Operation Warp Speed” in the US and “Operation Moonshot” in the U.K., does little to dispel such fears. The former connotes an intense, irresponsible rush, the latter an ”enterprise” with an unlikely and uncertain outcome.

Here are my edited top 24 reasons to avoid the current rollouts:

24) **US safety testing and data collection are in a shambles -** “More than 35 million Americans have received Covid vaccines, but the much-touted system the government designed to monitor any dangerous reactions won’t be capable of analyzing safety data for weeks or months, according to numerous federal health officials.

For now, federal regulators are counting on a patchwork of existing programs that they acknowledge are inadequate because of small sample size, missing critical data or other problems.”

What worries me about these symptoms and the Bell’s Palsy etc is that we hear they are temporary side effects, but this never gets followed up, if reported at all by MSM. Jim Ross of WWE suffered from BP for decades.

Not knowing how many of us us have already had mild or asymptomatic COVID, this is a real concern.

“Threlkeld said one way to avoid MIS-A would be to get vaccinated.

19) ""**Doctors Link Pfizer, Moderna Vaccines to Life-Threatening Blood Disorder**: ""A second New York Times article quotes doctors who say the mRNA technology used in COVID vaccines may cause immune thrombocytopenia, a blood disorder that last month led to the death of a Florida doctor after his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine"":

It is designed so that it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs. In our case, the ""program” or “app” is our mRNA drug - the unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein.

[https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/mrna-platform-enabling-drug-discovery-development](https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/mrna-platform-enabling-drug-discovery-development)

I have yet to read a creepier paragraph. I know Pharma has recently redefined vaccine to incorporate mRNA treatments (much like they have for the words ‘pandemic‘ and the phrase ‘herd immunity‘ to suit their purposes, but this should only highlight their subterfuge.

Is this mRNA gene therapeutic called a vaccine so it can be fraudulently covered under the vaccine liability shield? (see point 11))

17) **The fact that they have to bribe us to take this trustworthy, perfectly safe solution to all our troubles:**

16) **AI needed to help reporting of expected high volume of ADR due to ‘vaccine’:**

“The MHRA urgently seeks an Artificial Intelligence (AI) software tool to process the expected high volume of Covid-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRs) and ensure that no details from the ADRs’ reaction text are missed”.

[https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4258/rr](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4258/rr)

15) **Threats to fertility via spike protein effects on the placenta**. Pharma can’t allay these fears, and are open (in their documentation, at least) about their ignorance on this matter. They’ve recently back-pedalled on discouraging pregnant women and women hoping to become pregnant from taking it though. Below you will see the discrepancy between information given to patients and doctors on this issue:

&#x200B;

14) **Antibody-dependent enhancement or pathogenic priming** \- another still-unproven yet undebunked threat. Does the “vaccine” create a greater threat to the immune system from contact with the wild virus? In the FDA documents, “vaccine enhanced disease” is listed as a possible outcome. (See below). The skipped animal trials might have highlighted this issue.

There’s also this from the U.K.  Column, looking specifically at Israel:

[Seems to suggest the vaccine increased the infection rate. Is this ADE or pathogenic priming?](https://preview.redd.it/rmgmtxke6ti61.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=66714c3051a3b4152191f9fdf2de910566470afc)

13) **The worrying outcomes in Australia, whereby guinea pigs/ cannon fodder somehow tested positive for HIV.** MSM claims these are false positives, but it does play into fears of autoimmune disasters predicted in FDA’s/ Pfizer’s own documents (see photo below).

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-55269381](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-55269381)

12) **Bell’s Palsy** \- cases of this appearing globally. Reported initially by the MSM as temporary (worrying enough) but predictably never followed up by the MSM. How do we know?

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9030943/Four-volunteers-got-Pfizers-vaccine-developed-Bells-palsy.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9030943/Four-volunteers-got-Pfizers-vaccine-developed-Bells-palsy.html)

11) **Pharma has no financial liability for any damage or fatality resultant from their mRNA treatment**. Why should they care about safety, let alone efficacy? No wonder most sensible people are baulking.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html)

10) **The trials skipped crucial steps, such as animal trials, and were only unleashed on the public as a result of governmental fiat emergency powers**. None of these treatments has been officially approved, and experimental substances were permitted to be injected into subjects only via emergency powers acts. Crucial stages have been skipped. Every original SARS vaccine trial fifteen years ago ended in animal fatality, especially when confronted by the wild virus.

9) **The “authorities” have been very clear that it is only designed to reduce symptoms and not infection transmission**. Masks, social distancing and lockdowns will continue nonetheless, so why bother for a virus with an over 99% recovery rate?

[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-infectious/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-infectious/)

from fakesoicansayshit:

“**Covid-19 mRNA vaccine is leaky and can accelerate deaths.**

Vaccines are 'perfect' (stops you from getting sick and getting others sick) or 'imperfect/leaky' (reduces symptoms, doesn't stop you from getting others sick). Imperfect vaccines can make viruses spread farther (host doesn't die) and become much deadlier (stronger versions survive).

Don't hang out around vaccinated people, unless you are.”

8) **The fact that we’ll need 2 doses and the cavalier recommendation (in the U.K. at least) that you can mix and match the treatments from different companies to ensure you get both does not promote confidence.** My father was given the first dose from Pfizer and the second from AstraZeneca a month later, one mRNA and one attenuated and apparently still safe and effective, despite zero trials to back up that claim.

7) Before unleashing the treatments, the FDA published this:

&#x200B;

[And this was BEFORE the public field trials\/ rollouts.](https://preview.redd.it/al19oesfrei61.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1257085fdda30014c228906c918114be89e66458)

Not exclusively related to mRNA treatments (don’t call them “vaccines”) but if they appear in the lists for adverse effects they have already occurred in the trials.

[https://www.fda.gov/media/143557/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/143557/download)

6) **Possible permanent, unresearched and unpredictable modifications on human DNA**. However much we hear in the MSM that it doesn’t and can’t affect DNA, many doctors claim otherwise. Changes to RNA messaging for DNA sounds to me like it will have a definite effect.

Dr Carrie Madej’s  work and research on the nano-program/ AI/ Transhumanist Agenda can be found here:

**5) The allergic reactions that started immediately**. Aren’t all adverse reactions considered “allergic”? Aren’t all adverse reactions “significant”? Subjects with allergies were being told to hold off from having the “vaccine”. Think those proposed delays have now been removed.

[https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/breaking-people-who-suffer-significant-23139049](https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/breaking-people-who-suffer-significant-23139049)

4) **It’s meagre weeks of trial testing (sometimes lasting 5 days) on predominantly youngish and healthy subjects can tell us little about their safety and efficacy on the elderly and the vulnerable** (yet they’re the first to receive it)

Be cognisant of the fact that the public rollout IS the continuation of the Phase 3 trial. We are the guinea pigs and cannon fodder.

UK authorities explicitly say that under-16s, pregnant women, those with history of allergies (and the elderly) should NOT take the vaccine. Still pushing it on all three though, despite no specific testing at all on these demographics.

""It's not safe for these 3 groups of people to get a COVID-19 vaccine"":

[https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2124562485533/its-not-safe-for-these-3-groups-of-people-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2124562485533/its-not-safe-for-these-3-groups-of-people-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine)

""We don't know anything about groups they didn't study, like children, pregnant women, highly immunocompromised people and the eldest of the elderly,"" Dr. Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota, said.

2) **The medium to long term effects which NOONE can predict** or debunk, due to the insane, headlong rush to “save us” from this “pandemic”. “No time to test, just get it out there“ is apparently the mantra (though I suspect they have been testing these experimental treatments privately for decades...)

See no.22 above:

""In a new [research article](https://scivisionpub.com/pdfs/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf) published in Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, veteran immunologist J. Bart Classen expresses similar concerns and writes that “RNA-based COVID vaccines have the potential to cause more disease than the epidemic of COVID-19.”

For decades, Classen has published papers exploring how vaccination can give rise to chronic conditions such as [Type 1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12482192/) and [Type 2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22934546/) diabetes — not right away, but three or four years down the road.

1. **The deaths** throughout the world already. Hundreds already reported but, with the reticence of patients and doctors to report the findings, it’s highly likely to already be significantly higher. That number will of course only rise (over 500 in the US alone as of 18th Feb 2021 - guarantee we never get a single proper investigation and the stories of individual cases quietly slip down the memory hole...)

Here is one of the many examples of the agency's coverup of 9-11-2001.*

_____________

**Technical Statement:**
NIST maintains that WTC 7 collapsed due to fire acting upon the 13th floor A2001 girder between columns 79 and 44 and the beams framing into it from the east.
They said that the beams expanded by 5.5” (revised in
June 2012 to 6.25”), broke the girder
erection bolts, and pushed this girder off its column 79 seat. This girder fell to floor 12, which then precipitated a cascade of floor failures from floor 12 down to floor 5,and
column 79 then became unsupported laterally causing it to buckle. It is then said that
column 79's buckling caused the upper floors to cascade down, which started a chain reaction
— a north - to - south then east - to - west horizontal, progressive collapse — with a global exterior collapse that was captured on the videos. The first omission concerns flange
- to - web stiffeners on the south end of the girder (A2001).
See drawing 9114. 

*These omitted stiffeners would prevent the girder flange from folding
when the girder web moved beyond the seat, requiring twice the possible expansion of the
beams framing into the girder from the east to move the girder far enough to the west for it
to fall off its seat.*

145,This is a big deal. Actual election Fraud.,631.0,jzqjd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jzqjd5/this_is_a_big_deal_actual_election_fraud/,168.0,1606165684.0,"Alex Rodriguez, an “Independent” candidate who ran in the Florida Senate race has been accused of being a shadow candidate who ran solely to syphon votes away from the democratic candidate Jose Rodriguez.

Alex Rodriguez entered the race in an apparently successful attempt to confuse voters by having the same name as the democratic candidate. Managing to get 2600 votes despite being completely unknown to anyone.  

Those votes likely would have gone to Jose Rodriguez, but without them he lost to republican opponent  Latinas for Trump co-founder Ileana Garcia, who won by a razor-thin margin of .02 percent, just 34 votes.

Alex Rodriguez, 55 year old mechanic was a registered republican before suddenly decided to run for senate as an Independent. Alex did not have any campaign website or do any fundraising at all.


The only money recorded for the candidate is a $2,000 loan from himself and an undisclosed amount from a PAC called Our Florida. This PAC has be linked to 2 other possible shadow candidates in the Senate race. 

https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/526915-florida-investigating-third-party-candidate-who-ran-for-florida-state

When news stations tried to track down the mysterious Alex Rodriguez he initially tried to pretend to be somebody else. The following short video shows this interaction plus reports of a criminal history and evidence that this is part of a wider effort to subvert fair elections.

Alex doesnt even live in the county he ran for despite signing documents under oath that he did.

https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article247288694.html


Another accused shill shadow candidate shares a lot in common with Alex Rodriguez. 


Celso Alfonso, an 81-year-old retiree running as a no-party candidate in District 39, brought up several similarities.


Both had until recently been registered as Republicans. Both paid a qualifying free to be candidates on 12 June. Both listed Gmail addresses in the same format — first initial, last name, district number, and 2020. And both list just one contribution to their campaign — a $2,000 self-loan.

Support for each candidate also comes from the same Political Action Committee, ‘Our Florida’, which lists no previous political contributions or expenditures.

The PAC paid for fliers for each candidate from the same printing firm, Advance Impressions — its only expenditure, dated 5 October for $370,000 — using funds contributed two days earlier by a firm called Proclivity.

Proclivity’s address is a mailbox at a UPS Store in Atlanta, Georgia.

To me,it sounds like powerful people swayed the media to be bias and changed the information that people received.

""That’s why the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told, even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream–a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election; they were fortifying it. And they believe the public needs to understand the system’s fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures.""

That would be okay if it was moving everything back to a neutral playing field for both candidates. But it wasn't. These things were moving to shut Trump down. It's not much of a democracy if the political party that's so scared of losing, has to push a biased story and handpick information for the population, don't you think? For me it seems a little strange that SO MUCH effort was used to push a single narrative. Is more than 50% of America just so brain dead that they want Trump again and we need powerful people to brainwash them to think otherwise? I don't think so. Journalism is supposed to be neutral to allow people to make their own decisions, not spoon fed opinions.

There is only one story in the media. Trump bad. You don't hear anything else besides Trump bad and Biden good. Whether you see it or not, it is VERY biased and doesn't allow for neutral debate and for people to make their own decisions. Please feel free to go over to r/politics if you do not believe me, to see the single narrative. Once you see it, it is kind of hard to unsee it.


Their work touched every aspect of the election. They got states to change voting systems and laws and helped secure hundreds of millions in public and private funding. They fended off voter-suppression lawsuits, recruited armies of poll workers and got millions of people to vote by mail for the first time. They successfully pressured social media companies to take a harder line against disinformation and used data-driven strategies to fight viral smears. They executed national public-awareness campaigns that helped Americans understand how the vote count would unfold over days or weeks, preventing Trump’s conspiracy theories and false claims of victory from getting more traction. After Election Day, they monitored every pressure point to ensure that Trump could not overturn the result. “The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation,” says Norm Eisen, a prominent lawyer and former Obama Administration official who recruited Republicans and Democrats to the board of the Voter Protection Program.

149,"Remember that time in the 80s when contaminated Polio vaccines caused the HIV pandemic which was treated with a cure worse than the disease while the CIA blamed deaths caused by a dewormer in the cocaine they sold on AIDS to sweep the death toll under the rug?

First, the vaccines were contaminated by Simian Immunodeficiency Virus which eventually mutated into Human Immunodeficiency Virus.

The two viruses are only slightly genetically different.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2831797/

But that being said, there is still a chance that there were actually 2 causes of AIDS deaths. HIV as well as the cocaine the CIA was selling to finance their operations.

But cocaine doesn’t cause AIDS rah rah rah. No, it does not. But an ingredient being used to cut cocaine in the 80s did. Levamisole.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levamisole

“Levamisole was originally used as an anthelmintic to treat worm infestations in both humans and animals. Levamisole works as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist that causes continued stimulation of the parasitic worm muscles, leading to paralysis.”

However, repeated exposure to Levamisole is documented to cause symptoms which are basically AIDS symptoms.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3498128/

In case you didn’t know, the CIA sold massive amounts of cocaine in the US to fund their operations (not a theory it’s totally proven).

Because the CIA wanted to cover their tracks, they networked with health services to make sure that patients who were HIV negative suffering from immune system issues caused by Levamisole were still given an HIV diagnosis based on symptoms alone and not on a positive PCR test. Sound familiar lately?

To further compound things, there is a chance that HIV might not even be lethal in human populations.

https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/hiv-aids-fact-or-fraud/

So there you have it. Vaccines caused HIV. There’s a chance the cures for HIV were worse than the virus (AZT) and even that the virus didn’t cause any deaths at all. Again, a dewormer had something to do with it. 

Welcome back to the rabbit hole.

Also, Fauci was heading the HIV response back in the day and just like this time around made millions on a cure which may have been worse than the disease.

Maybe it’s time to stop putting up with any of this and just go back to farming our own food. I’d rather just take my chances than be a pawn in any of these types of games!

Edit: Someone in the comments pointed out that the Hep B vaccines given to gay men in the USA were also tainted with the same virus so there’s that too. Fact checked and it pans out as well.

150,My research on glyphosate (roundup). Brain Dump. Calling all biologists and neuroscientists.,625.0,55kvcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/55kvcx/my_research_on_glyphosate_roundup_brain_dump/,166.0,1475450558.0,"So after watching the VAXXED documentary that was posted here earlier, I decided to do some personal research into glyphosate. What I found revealed a DEEP rabbit hole that I have only begun to explore. Great thanks go out to [Dr. Stephanie Seneff](https://www.csail.mit.edu/user/1389) who is single-handedly leading the frontier on glyphosate research. Her background in artificial intelligence allows her to scan thousands of research articles and make connections that few others are able to make. I truly believe this is the future of scholarship as an interdisciplinary approach to knowledge is the next step for human progress. I have a bachelor's degree in neuroscience, which has helped me to understand the studies I have read, but I do not claim to be an expert. I would love to collaborate with anyone who has an interest in the issue of glyphosate.

TL;DR version: Glyphosate causes deficiencies of things we need and accumulation of things we don't like.

**Intro:**

[Glyphosate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate) is the active chemical used in the herbicide Roundup, created by Monsanto in [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Franz). Glyphosate works by inhibiting the [shikimate pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikimate_pathway) which produces the essential [aromatic amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_amino_acids) tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and histidine. Without these, plants die. [About 90%](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us/recent-trends-in-ge-adoption.aspx#.U6fueajjn5I) of GMO crops are modified to be resistant to glyphosate, so that the entire field can be sprayed without affecting the crops. [Surfactants are used](http://www.monsanto.com/glyphosate/pages/what-is-a-surfactant.aspx) to increase glyphosate's ability to penetrate plant's cell wall, meaning that washing your produce will not remove glyphosate.

**How glyphosate might harm you:**

**Inhibition of Shikimate Pathway:**

Humans also need tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and histidine, but because we don't have the Shikimate Pathway, we must get them from our diet. Our gut microbes have the Shikimate Pathway, and are once source for these amino acids. It is unclear from my research how much of these amino acids come directly from the diet and how much comes from our gut microbes. Any help here would be great. In any case, glyphosate can inhibit the shikimate pathway in gut microbes, lowering our amount of aromatic amino acids, particularly tryptophan. Tryptophan is very important because it is the precursor to serotonin and melatonin. [Gut microbes have been shown to be affected](http://library.au.dk/fileadmin/www.bibliotek.au.dk/fagsider/jordbrug/Specialer/Master_Thesis_final.pdf) at concentrations of .001 mg/ml while [glyphosate has been been detected in humans](http://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/detection-of-glyphosate-residues-in-animals-and-humans-2161-0525.1000210.pdf) at levels up to .071 mg/ml. 

**Inhibition of CYPs:**

[Cytochrome P450 enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450#P450s_in_humans) (CYPs) are crucial for a number of reasons. They synthesize and metabolize hormones, maintaining homeostasis. They synthesize cholesterol. They metabolize vitamin D. And most importantly, they also metabolize potentially toxic compounds. [Glyphosate has been shown to inhibit CYPs.](http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/4/1416) Without CYPs the many toxic compounds we encounter on a daily basis can not be broken down and will accumulate.

**Inhibition of serum sulfate transport:**

Sulfate is critical to the body for several reasons. Sulfate is needed for bile acid synthesis, lysosome function, and joint tissue function. Both sulfate and glyphosate are [kosmotropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmotropic), with glyphosate having stronger kosmotropic properties. Kosmotropes promote water-water interactions, making water more viscous as well as making other compounds, such as proteins, less soluble. This is called ""salting out"" and it is not something you want too much of because when compounds are insoluble in the blood, they are not available to the body.  Fortunately sulfate alone is not too bad. However, in the presence of glyphosate, a strong kosmotrope, the gut does not want to put sulfate into the blood because it will aggravate the problem that glyphosate is causing. Instead one thing it can do is to oxidize aromatic amino acids, such as tryptophan, into various phenolic compounds that can bind to sulfate and take it into the blood in a non-kosmotropic form (this is another potential cause of tryptophan depletion). Once the sulfate has been transported to its destination it detaches from the phenol. These phenols are toxic as they can breakdown phospholipid bilayers and DNA.  

**Accidental insertion into proteins in place of glycine (this one is only theoretical):**

Glyphosate is a synthetic form of glycine. Its chemical name is actually N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine. The only difference is that glyphosate has a phosphonomethyl group attached to it. Because of this it is possible that during the process of protein synthesis glyphosate is mistaken for glycine and inserted into the polypeptide chain. Glycine is one of the most important amino acids. It serves roles in active sites and it also provides flexibility in proteins as occurs in ligament tissue. The phosphonomethyl group would prevent both of those activities. When faulty proteins are created, they must be broken down by the cell causing oxidative stress. In addition, glyphosate's inhibition of CYPs reduces the cells ability to break down these faulty proteins causing accumulation which can cause cell death. While this accidental insertion has not been proven, Monsanto's own long term studies showed that animals were [exhaling the radioactive C-14](https://people.csail.mit.edu/seneff/DC2016/AnthonySamsel_DC2016.pdf) (pg. 9) that they put into the glyphosate that was given to animals, suggesting that it is being metabolized and utilized in vivo.

**Transport of heavy metals, such as aluminium, across the blood brain barrier (BBB):**

The structure of [glyphosate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glyphosate#section=Top) and [citrate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Aluminum_citrate#section=Top) are similar in that they both have 3 OH groups (citrate has 3 carbonyl groups, while glyphosate has 1 carbonyl group and 1 phosphonyl group). These OH groups allow citrate to [chelate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation) aluminium and [carry it across the blood brain barrier.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1987654) Al citrate is the most prominent form of Al in the brain. [Aluminium chloride has been shown to inactivate glyphosate](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.1978.tb01162.x/abstract), indicating that Al is also chelated by glyphosate. Because glyphosate is so similar to glycine, it can cross the BBB carrying the aluminium with it. [Glyphosate also opens up the gut barrier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678255), allowing more of the heavy metals we encounter to enter the bloodstream, along with many other toxins. Although the brain gets rid of Al citrate faster than it takes it up (I assume the same is true for Al glyphosate) a fraction of the aluminium separates from the citrate and is retained, leading to accumulation([source1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10612065) [source2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12426115)). 


**Additional things to consider:**

The problems described above are associated with:

* diabetes 
* obesity 
* asthma
* autism
* chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* pulmonary edema
* adrenal insufficiency
* hypothyroidism
* Alzheimer’s disease
* amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
* Parkinson’s disease
* prion diseases
* lupus
* mitochondrial disease
* nonHodgkin’s lymphoma
* neural tube defects
* infertility
* hypertension
* glaucoma
* osteoporosis
* fatty liver disease
* kidney failure

Among others

[Glyphosate has been detected in vaccines.](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yesmaam/pages/1707/attachments/original/1473092174/312_Honeycutt__Zen_Glyphosate_10_Samples_Version_1.2.pdf?1473092174) The highest bioaccumulation of glyphosate occurs in bone and bone marrow which is the source of gelatin. Gelatin is used to create vaccines, so this is likely the way glyphosate gets into vaccines.

**Possible fraud in current and future glyphosate studies:**

Typically the government does not accept studies that use the ELISA method of detecting glyphosate, so liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) is preferred. When researching this method I came across [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4743594/) which claims to have developed the best method for detecting glyphosate with LC-MS. Two out of four researchers are Monsanto employees. Also in the acknowledgments the authors thank Monsanto and [Covance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covance) for method development and validation. So Monsanto told them how to do the study AND used its own labs to determine that the results were valid. This seemed pretty fishy to me. Unsurprisingly, three months later the same scientists (plus one more Monsanto employee) did [another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27030536) using this detection method to determine that glyphosate was NOT detected in breast milk. These studies were done earlier this year and I would not be surprised if this method is used more to show that glyphosate does not get into humans.

With the recent acquisition of Monsanto by Bayer there is [concern that glyphosate could start showing up in our drinking water](http://www.activistpost.com/2016/09/bayer-buys-monsanto-merger-more-than-meets-the-eye.html).",conspiracy,fraud

# People are often curious about which conspiracy documents

or accounts most reveal the plan for a New World Order of worldwide totalitarian control. “*Where’s the proof,”* some people ask, *“of this supposed plot to dominate the Earth?”* These 3 conspiracy documents or accounts which I am about to present, are, in my opinion, the 3 most chilling conspiracy documents or accounts ever concocted in the mind of man. All of them lay out the groundwork for the implementation of an incredibly evil agenda of a small group of manipulators to rule the world. Indeed, if you have never come across them before, the scale of their evil can quite defy belief and imagination. It is hard for the average person to believe that such a plot could be possible, let alone being carried out so actively.

The situation is well summed up by a quote attributed to former FBI head Edgar Hoover: *“The individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists.”*

However, although these conspiracy documents and accounts may appear as myths, stories or a work of fiction, their content is so compelling and so deadly accurate, it is very difficult to ignore them or sweep them under the mental carpet. It is impossible to see the world in quite the same way after reading them. They describe in minute detail a world of rulers and slaves, where the actions, attitudes, beliefs, thoughts, preferences, ideas and reproduction of the masses are controlled by the elite with the utmost precision. For anyone with a conscience, whose heart yearns for truth, freedom or dignity, the implications of these documents and accounts cannot be overstated. If they are real – which I completely believe they are – everyone of us needs to do whatever we can to ensure we never let them become a reality, if we care even a little about the future of the human race. Combined with books like Orwell’s 1984 and Huxley’s Brave New World, anyone who is curious about the New World Order can glean a very good understanding by reading these.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 

### Conspiracy Document #1: The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion

The oldest of the 3 conspiracy documents I am presenting here is entitled [*The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion*](http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/przion1.htm). It was written sometime around 1895. Hitler read it, and it may well have escalated his hatred of the Jews; Henry Ford thought the document was so dangerous that he funded printing of 500,000 copies that were distributed throughout the US in the 1920s. It is written from the perspective of the “Elders of Zion” which literally means rich and wise Jewish rulers, and presents a plan for theses rulers to enslave the rest of humanity. Because of this, it has been accused of being an anti-semitic fraud.

However, if you read the text from the viewpoint of Controller vs. Controlled, it all makes sense. If you interpret it through the filter of “Jew=Ruler” vs. “Non-Jew=Goyim=Slave”, you realize that the message of it has nothing to do with Jews or Judaism per se. It is rather all about a small cabal of conceited people, thinking they are inherently superior and that they have the right to rule over all others. **The overtly Jewish language is mostly a smokescreen to cover the real (and deadly) intent of the Protocols**; I say mostly because there is, at the same time, a strong and undeniable Jewish element to the global conspiracy, centered around the [Rothschilds](https://thefreedomarticles.com/the-rothschilds-own-israel/) and their creation of [Zionism and Israel](https://thefreedomarticles.com/category/zionism/).

The Protocols promotes the way in which a small, power-hungry, cunning and intelligent group can stealthily take over society, by gaining control of banking, the media and Government. It pushes the idea of collectivism to fool people into giving up individual rights “for the greater good” when, in fact, this means allowing the gross centralization of power in Government, regardless of whether that government is “left” (Communist) or “right” (Fascist), which are just labels to confuse people. It shamelessly promotes the exploitation of the weak by the strong, and a society based on hierarchy. It boasts how the “elders” were the force behind the French and other revolutions. It idealizes a world where elite rulers have the right to decide who lives and who dies.

Mr. Henry Ford, in an interview published in the New York WORLD, February 17th, 1921, said:

> *“The only statement I care to make about the PROTOCOLS is that they fit in with what is going on. They are sixteen years old, and they have fitted the world situation up to this time. THEY FIT IT NOW.”* 

&#x200B;

 Here are some quotes from it so you can see what it advocates, see how the writers of this conspiracy document regard the rest of humanity, and see how the self-appointed “elders” think of themselves: 

 

>*“Our right lies in force … I find a new right – to attack by the right of the strong … to become the sovereign lord of those who have left to us the rights of their power by laying them down voluntarily…. The GOYIM are a flock of sheep, and we are their wolves.”*  
>  
>*“The result justifies the means … This evil is the one and only means to attain the end, the good. Therefore we must not stop at bribery, deceit and treachery when they should serve towards the attainment of our end. In politics one must know how to seize the property of others without hesitation if by it we secure submission and sovereignty.”*  
>  
>*“The administrators, whom we shall choose from among the public, with strict regard to their capacities for servile obedience, will not be persons trained in the arts of government, and will therefore easily become pawns in our game in the hands of men of learning and genius who will be their advisers, specialists bred and reared from early childhood to rule the affairs of the whole world.”*  
>  
>*“It is essential for all to know that OWING TO DIFFERENCE IN THE OBJECTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY THERE CANNOT BE ANY EQUALITY.”*  
>  
>*“IT IS INDISPENSABLE FOR US TO UNDERMINE ALL FAITH, TO TEAR OUT OF THE MIND OF THE “GOYIM” THE VERY PRINCIPLE OF GOD-HEAD AND THE SPIRIT, AND TO PUT IN ITS PLACE ARITHMETICAL CALCULATIONS AND MATERIAL NEEDS.”*  
>

### Conspiracy Account #2: The Secret 1969 Speech of Dr. Richard Day

The 2nd conspiracy document is actually a written account of a speech given by [Dr. Richard Day in 1969](http://rense.com/general94/nwoplans.htm) to a group of pediatric doctors. One of the members in the audience, Dr. Lawrence Dunegan, later recalled the speech. Dr. Day died in 1989 but at the time was a director of Planned Parenthood, a Rockefeller-funded organization that promotes population control through family planning, contraceptives and abortions. Planned Parenthood can be seen as a continuation of the eugenics agenda the elite have been pursuing for centuries, i.e. to reduce the population of “inferior” races.

Dr. Day began his speech by telling everyone to turn off any recording devices, and to not take notes. He then described the changes that would take place in society in the coming decades, from redirecting sex (encouraging promiscuity) to health (suppressing cancer cures and eliminating private doctors) to schools (changing education to indoctrination) to population control (setting up a system to force people to ask permission to have babies). He further declared that the Controllers running the global conspiracy would induce heart attacks as a form of assassination to kill political opponents (or any dissenters resisting their scheme), promote alcohol and drug abuse to weaken the will and mental clarity of the masses, consolidate their grip on the media and restrict the flow of information, obstruct the ability of the ordinary person to travel freely and combine all the world’s religions into a One World Religion. Scarily enough, all these plans and more have either become or are about to become a reality.

Here are some further points from his speech:

– People will have to get used to change; everything will change, constantly;

– Everything will have 2 goals: the stated goal and the real goal;

– Euthanasia will be encouraged via a “Demise Pill” (i.e. a suicide pill);

– New difficult-to-diagnose and untreatable diseases will emerge (released by elite-controlled BioWeapons Labs);

– Cancer cures will be suppressed as a means of population control;

– Food will be controlled by one giant industry;

– Weather modification will be used by the Government against foreign and domestic enemies.

### Conspiracy Document #3: Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars

The 3rd conspiracy document, like the other two above, was never meant to be seen or released to the public at large, but luckily the truth spilled out. [*Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars, An Introduction Programming Manual*](http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/sw4qw/index.shtml) was found by accident on July 7, 1986 when an employee of Boeing Aircraft Co. bought a surplus IBM copier for scrap parts. It details how society can be “energetically” controlled by the elite; it looks at people and money as units of electricity or energy that must obey certain laws of physics. It calls for the enslavement of humanity to be brought about quietly and stealthily by the elite using silent weapons, so that people will become gradually confused, distracted, weak and trapped, unable to put their finger on what is happening, why it is happening and who is doing it:

 

>*“It is patently impossible to discuss social engineering or the automation of a society, i.e., the engineering of social automation systems (silent weapons) on a national or worldwide scale without implying extensive objectives of social control and destruction of human life, i.e., slavery and genocide. This manual is in itself an analog declaration of intent. Such a writing must be secured from public scrutiny. Otherwise, it might be recognized as a technically formal declaration of domestic war. Furthermore, whenever any person or group of persons in a position of great power and without full knowledge and consent of the public, uses such knowledge and methodologies for economic conquest – it must be understood that a state of domestic warfare exists between said person or group of persons and the public. The solution of today’s problems requires an approach which is ruthlessly candid, with no agonizing over religious, moral or cultural values.”*  
>  
>*“All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end is control. Beyond this remains only one issue: Who will be the beneficiary?”*  
>  
>*“Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency or deposit loan accounts had the required appearance of power that could be used to induce people (inductance, with people corresponding to a magnetic field) into surrendering their real wealth in exchange for a promise of greater wealth (instead of real compensation) … Mr. Rothschild loaned his promissory notes to individual and to governments. These would create overconfidence. Then he would make money scarce, tighten control of the system, and collect the collateral through the obligation of contracts. The cycle was then repeated. These pressures could be used to ignite a war. Then he would control the availability of currency to determine who would win the war. That government which agreed to give him control of its economic system got his support. Collection of debts was guaranteed by economic aid to the enemy of the debtor. The profit derived from this economic methodology made Mr. Rothschild all the more able to expand his wealth.”*

&#x200B;

 Perhaps the most famous and oft-quoted passage from the document is this: 

 

>*“Everything that is expected from an ordinary weapon is expected from a silent weapon by its creators, but only in its own manner of functioning.*  
>  
>*It shoots situations, instead of bullets; propelled by data processing, instead of chemical reaction (explosion); originating from bits of data, instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operated by a computer programmer, instead of a marksman; under the orders of a banking magnate, instead of a military general.*  
>  
>*It makes no obvious explosive noises, causes no obvious physical or mental injuries, and does not obviously interfere with anyone’s daily social life.*  
>  
>*Yet it makes an unmistakable “noise,” causes unmistakable physical and mental damage, and unmistakably interferes with the daily social life, i.e., unmistakable to a trained observer, one who knows what to look for.*  
>  
>*The public cannot comprehend this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon.*  
>  
>*The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong, but that is because of the technical nature of the silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling in a rational way, or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do not know how to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to defend themselves against it.*  
>  
>*When a silent weapon is applied gradually, the public adjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on their lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great and they crack up.*  
>  
>*Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the vitality, options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by knowing, understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses.”*

&#x200B;

 Distraction of the public is also a key theme promoted: 

 

>*“Experience has prevent that the simplest method of securing a silent weapon and gaining control of the public is to keep the public undisciplined and ignorant of the basic system principles on the one hand, while keeping them confused, disorganized, and distracted with matters of no real importance on the other hand.*  
>  
>*This is achieved by:*  
>  
>*disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a low-quality program of public education in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics; and discouraging technical creativity.*  
>  
>*engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities, by:*  
>  
>*unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape) by way of constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media – especially the T.V. and the newspapers.*  
>  
>*giving them what they desire – in excess – “junk food for thought” – and depriving them of what they really need.*  
>  
>*rewriting history and law and subjecting the public to the deviant creation, thus being able to shift their thinking from personal needs to highly fabricated outside priorities.*  
>  
>*These preclude their interest in and discovery of the silent weapons of social automation technology.*  
>  
>*The general rule is that there is a profit in confusion; the more confusion, the more profit. Therefore, the best approach is to create problems and then offer solutions.”*

### Common Themes of These 3 Conspiracy Documents

The above 3 conspiracy documents or accounts have a lot in common. They all share the following themes, which many alternative investigators have come to know as hallmarks of the New World Order:

– Erection of a supra-national World Government based on the idea of **collectivism**

– Construction of a highly-segmented, **two-tier society of rulers and slaves**

– **Centralized control** of the key power centers of society: banking, police/military, media, education, industry and government itself

– Manipulation of the masses through coercion, but also through deception: **mind control** and **electronic influence**, such that its targets are unaware they are being attacked

Needless to say, these documents alert us to the grave danger faced by humanity. We have a big challenge in front of us to shine the light on this agenda. However, on a deeper level, that’s why the NWO agenda exists: to force us to wake up, speak up and stand up to create a better world.",conspiracy,fraud

157,BOOM! The Arizona election steal revealed …. The best is yet to come,600.0,pv94gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pv94gg/boom_the_arizona_election_steal_revealed_the_best/,367.0,1632584214.0,"First off, it is important to know that there are THREE angles to figuring out the election fraud in Arizona.

1. The AZ election audit, which is a count and verification of the ballots provided by Maricopa County. This was today's presentation.
2. A canvassing (walking door to door) of local residents of Maricopa County to attempt to verify voting anomalies (voters with resident addresses that don't exist or that have multiple people listed, etc.). This was NOT done by any government agency. Sen. Wendy Rogers said that they wanted to do this themselves, but the federal government made threats, so they let local residents do it on their own.
3. The machines. Dominion and Smartmatic for Arizona. This is the angle Lindell has been working.

So ... let's put the pieces of the puzzle together.

Lindell said that Trump won Arizona by 270,000 votes. Today's presentation does not support that. They say the original vote count was roughly correct -- Biden by 10,000. BUT ... that assumes the audit HAD ACCESS TO ALL THE REAL VOTES!

If, somehow, there was a shift of 280,000 votes away from Trump to Biden, then that would give a ""result"" of Biden by 10,000. The audit would ONLY be reviewing THE BALLOTS THAT MARICOPA COUNTY GAVE THE SENATE.

And ... THAT IS HOW IT HAPPENED.

* Trump won Arizona by 270,000 votes.
* The computers were used to SWITCH 280,000 votes.
* They ADDED votes for Biden AFTER 11/3/2020, but it was not enough.
* Then, they DELETED some Trump votes to get to the number they needed.
* Maricopa County then delayed as long as they could, so that the physical ballots would add up (roughly) to the machine numbers.

What is the evidence for this?

1. The physical canvass, led by Liz Harris, showed (a) 173,104 votes were DISCARDED (these were Trump votes, no doubt), and (b) 96,389 votes were cast by someone other than the actual voter (these were Biden votes, no doubt).

[https://americanfaith.com/173000-lost-votes-in-maricopa-county-2020-presidential-election/](https://americanfaith.com/173000-lost-votes-in-maricopa-county-2020-presidential-election/)

1. Still not quite enough, they added some duplicate votes where 95% did not have signatures -- this was presented by Dr. Shiva today.
2. Maricopa County had the highest adjudication rate in the country -- 11%. These are ballots that are REVIEWED BY SOMEONE, rather than just counted in the machine. 11% of 2,100,000 votes is 230,000. Serial numbers on these adjudicated ballots do NOT match! AZ Sen. Kelly Townsend just verified this.
3. Somebody DELETED files from the machines the DAY BEFORE the AZ audit started.
4. Remember: A member of the Maricopa County Board owns a huge chicken farm, where there was a massive fire right around the time the senate was trying to get physical custody of the ballots.

It did not necessarily need to be 280,000 votes. Could have been 140,000 votes flipped, but the point is what they did. After a night to sleep on it, I would summarize it this way:

1. On election night, the election machines changed votes to flip it for Biden. Some people (Murdock) knew ahead of time, which is why they were confident in ""calling it"" early. The machines changed the votes. Even then, they had to stop in the middle of the night, so that somebody (who?) could re-calcluate and re-set the algo to make it come out with the pre-determined result they wanted.
2. That created a problem. The actual physical ballots were not the same as what the machine count showed. That's why they delayed the ""official count"" so they could add Biden votes and trash Trump votes. That way, the physical ballots would match the computer count. Even then, they didn't have it right.
3. As pressure gathered to do a real audit, somebody at the Maricopa County Commision Board delayed to try and run out the clock. They filed multiple lawsuits to delay or stop it (lost them all).
4. The day before the audit was to begin, somebody got into the machines and deleted the records, evidenced by the CyberNinjas report yesterday.
5. Somewhere along the line, people destroyed some ballots and created fake ballots. This was done so that the physical ""evidence"" would match up with the official machine count. The presentation by the auditors was about the physical ballots given to the senate by Maricopa County, but that does not mean these ballots represent the actual ballots cast by the real voters of Maricopa county.",conspiracy,fraud

The [Robinson Jeffers Boxing Club](https://craignelsen.com/rjbc/index.php)  was a 13-week closed residency program of healthy eating, exercise,  academics (including math, philosophy, literature, music, history, and,  to help the men conceptualize a higher way of living, poetry), and daily  two-hour sessions of intensive boxing training.

The  program was an attempt to do something about the epidemic of suicides  and deaths of despair that is devastating white males in the US (while  white males are 30 percent of the population, we are 70 percent of the  suicides(!!!)). The program was open to men of any race, of course, but  tailored to address the particular challenges faced by white males.

By  ""tailored to address"" I mean that in our history component, for  example, we would read actual source materials from American history.  For young white men, who only know the poisonous and distorted history  they've learned from Hollywood and our corrupt educational  establishment, the impact of learning their ancestors were just  humans--not demons--can be really profound. (And it wouldn't hurt  black  guys, Latino guys, Jewish guys, or Asian guys to read actual historical  documents either.)

Unfortunately,  the Southern Poverty Law Center caught wind of our effort and published  a vicious hit piece comparing our program to ""Nazi atrocities"" and  leaving the people of Lexington with the false belief we were white  supremacists (my partner was black) opening a whites-only program.

The  day after the article appeared, the City of Lexington  served us with a  stop work order under threat of arrest. Also in the immediate aftermath  of the article's publication, Kickstarter pulled the plug on our  fundraising campaign without explanation, the owner of the building,  citing the SPLC article in a text message, withdrew use of the building,  funders we had been counting on got cold feet, and complete strangers  screamed ""Nazi"" and ""racist"" from their cars as they drove past.

The effort was destroyed and my partner and I were both financially ruined.

In  November, 2018, I filed suit, pro se, pleading  defamation. Even though I am not a lawyer, my suit survived the SPLC's  Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss on July 31, 2019--the first of something  like 60 defamation actions against the SPLC over the years to clear that  hurdle.  I have [a good case](https://craignelsen.com/nelsen_v_splc/index.php).

Four months after I filed the case, the SPLC announced it was ousting octogenarian co-founder, Morris Dees. The explanation, which all the main stream media dutifully repeated, was that Dees, years earlier, had fostered a racist and sexist atmosphere in the organization.  The very next week, SPLC president, Richard Cohen, SPLC chairman of the board of directors, Alan Howard, and SPLC director of litigation, Rhonda Brownstein, also resigned. Shortly after that, Heidi Beirich, the last of the old guard management, resigned, too. 

The Southern Poverty Law Center, whose mission statement in its incorporation documents --the basis on which it received its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status--reads ""TO EDUCATE THE EDUCATIONALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DEPRIVED"" has managed to stash away a half billion dollars in assets, half of which is in off-shore bank accounts out of the reach of US regulators. Even though this information is available to the public, the main stream media didn't think it was worth mentioning as, perhaps, an alternative explanation for the entire leadership of an organization that consistently brings in over a hundred million dollars per year suddenly heading for the exits.  Instead, the media went with the explanation given by Richard Cohen, that his resignation was to take responsibility for the racist and sexist climate Morris Dees had created decades earlier and to give the organization a chance to ""heal"". 

I would like to know:

1. How is it a tax-exempt charity, formed to help the underprivileged, can accumulate a half billion dollars in assets and hold money in off-shore bank accounts? For sure, a large number of the SPLC's donors--well-meaning, if tragically gullible--did not intend their donations to purchase real estate in Israel for the upper management. Isn't that fraud? Do we still have a Department of Justice?
2. The SPLC and the ADL both publish a laughably bogus ""hate map"", which, apparently, never fails to wow the rubes. And that's their grift. But isn't it rather ominous that powerful media organs and information gate-keepers like Amazon, Google, Facebook, et al., allow these frauds to determine who may or may not participate in our national debate and what they are allowed to say? Where is the Federal Trade Commission?

The  Robinson Jeffers Boxing Club business plan projected we would be able  take in 18 new men every week when at full capacity. It angers me that,  every week, now, thanks to the SPLC, another 18 names are added to the  list of men who, suffering the pain of utter despair, never had the  chance to try our new and innovative method of helping them reclaim  their lives--for themselves and for their families. It angers me that  the Robinson Jeffers Boxing Club isn't serving as an encouraging example  of what is possible, but, instead, thanks to the SPLC, stands as a  dispiriting warning not to try.

It  would be a real shame if this great case is wasted. Nothing would be  better than to win a large jury award and open ten Robinson Jeffers  Boxing Clubs with the SPLC's money--the biggest one across the street  from Morris Dees' house in Montgomery, Alabama.

According to Merriam-Webster:
Definition of vaccine
: a preparation of killed microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms that is administered to produce or artificially increase immunity to a particular disease
 

The mRNA ""vaccines"" doesn't contain ""killed microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, nor living fully virulent organisms"". They contain modified messenger RNA from a virus* that fools cells to produce proteins from assumed virus.  I don't know what is right name for that technique, but it is not vaccination in its established meaning. It is miss leading people. I have read many arguments like ""it is as save as other vaccines"" ""vaccines are proved to work, so this also works"" etc..

I think it is called vaccine for few reasons. Is much easier to convenience people to trust old proven medicine than say that they should inject them self some new experimental medicines. If they call it mRNA therapy, what it actually is, I assume even more people would be suspicious about it. 

Secondly, it is in common belief system that we should vaccine all the people ( or at least most). So as this new mRNA therapy type of medicine is vaccine, it follows that we have to give it for all.

Thirdly. Anti-Vaxcers.... If you oppose this new experimental mRNA Ther... exucse me, Vaccine, then you are Anti-Vaxer so you are anti-scientific lunatic and there is no need to listen what you are saying.    

Maybe we should start to point out that the mRNA Vaccines aren't actually vaccines. It would be also nice to how the vaccines are defined in law.

A few days ago, pewdiepie [posted this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PLgOaVXmGU) about his concerns over the questionable ""Better Help"" online therapy service.

Some of the major red flags concerning this service are the fact that despite claiming ""HIPAA"" certification and that their therapists are ""vetted"" thoroughly, if you *actually* read the terms of service, they offer *zero* guarantee regarding the credentials of these ""therapists"" and that the HIPAA ""certification"" is fraudulent and literally made up.

In addition, many major youtubers happened to experience ""psychological problems"" at around the same time...and then *just happened* to stumble upon BetterHelp and start promoting the service aggressively.

Another aspect of this fraud is that people with *genuine* mental health and depression problems are routinely turned away from the service, strongly suggesting that they are focusing their predatory sights on those who are only somewhat, or even ""superficially"", depressed.

While pewdiepie's video is a good place to start, and credit to him for using his platform in a positive way like this, *another* youtuber named Memology 101 has been doing the lion's share of work in exposing this incredibly deceptive and pernicious conspiracy.

His documentary series is called ""Why YouTubers Are Depressed"" and is worth watching in its entirety, so here are all the parts so far:

Fauci coordinated with the Chinese Communists to censor the Lab Attack FACTS. 

He deliberately lied on SAFETY. That fucker knew Masks were BULL SHIT and still pushed them onto American society. He said it right the 1st Time: Masks are a Feel Good Measure. Then said everyone needs to wear one, then two. While not wearing them himself.

Even after the Freedom of Information Requests the media is still getting butt raped by him. Going as far as to call it a “Leak”. The blatant not giving a fuck about truth and damming evidence is insane. It confirms my belief that this was a well coordinated effort between Fauci, his Chinese Communist allies, the media, and Democrats to release Fauci-Chinese Virus IN A ELECTION YEAR to get rid of Trump.

The conspiracy behind transgender medicine.,492.0,dchj9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dchj9k/dr_kenneth_zucker_counseled_560_patients_with_gid/,173.0,1570054532.0,"####**This is just one aspect of many, one piece to the puzzle in understanding the conspiracy of transgender medicine.**

**This is about is ethics, fairness, and quality in medicine and treatment. Those suffering with gender dysphoria deserve the most effective and lowest risk treatments.
But there are blatant injustices surrounding this issue.**

The issue of “gender identity”/transgender health is rapidly evolving and changing the way medicine is being practiced, including standards for children, many of them risky, and largely experimental due to lack of historical precedent.

**When children are essentially pushed in the direction of transition and consequently SRS, it calls into question the “do no harm” principle.** The new standards push transition, and allow for puberty blockers to be given as young as 11 and cross-sex hormones as young as 16 years old (and possibly SRS at 18), the combination of which often causes lifelong infertility and puts them at a number of other health risks.

**There is dissent on this issue within the medical community, and it includes hundreds of medical professionals and scientists.** Just because it is not publicly apparent doesn’t mean that there isn’t disagreement. While it is highly unethical to exclude research simply on the basis that the findings go against the current consensus, that’s exactly what is happening.

If you look at how the standards have shifted, WPATH is the group that first lobbied the APA to change Gender Identity Disorder to “gender dysphoria” essentially declassifying it as a mental illness of a delusional state game to a diagnosis of depression. This “professional” organization has no membership requirement other than an interest in transgenderism. 

The American Academy of Pediatricians (membership of 65,000) adopts new standards and guidelines through use of “special interest groups” (a fraction of the membership) who bring forward their opinions to an executive committee that makes decisions to represent the entire society.

Obviously we are all in favor of strong scientific research in medicine. But there is legitimate dissent within the community that is being ignored.  This is disconcerting, especially when there are children heavily involved and affected.

#**This is what makes it a “conspiracy”....**

The American Psychological Association’s Handbook of Sexuality and Psychology admits that **prior to the widespread promotion of transition affirmation, 75 to 95 percent of pre-pubertal children who were distressed by their biological sex eventually outgrew that distress.** The vast majority came to accept their biological sex by late adolescence after passing naturally through puberty.

Medical transition has now been widely accepted as the new standard for GID despite historical data that shows that psychiatric therapy can be largely effective in treating gender dysphoria. 

Dr. Kenneth Zucker, a psychologist in Toronto who over the course of 35-40 years had counseled 560+patients and had 98% success in males and over 80% success in females in returning to their natal sex. 

Zucker’s practice was shut down in December 2015. [But he sued for unfair dismissal & libel and won, including a public apology from Toronto’s Centre of Addition and Mental Health (CAMH).](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nationalreview.com/2018/10/transgender-orthodoxy-kenneth-zucker-vindicated/amp/)

>*Following three years of legal fees and media silence at the request of his ex-boss and the advice of his lawyers,* ***Dr. Kenneth J. Zucker has reached a public settlement with Toronto’s Centre of Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) for unfair dismissal and libel.*** *The Centre’s $586,000 payout was accompanied by its public apology for, among other things, publishing the false allegation on their website that Dr. Zucker had called a transgender patient “a hairy little vermin.”

>John Adair, Dr. Zucker’s lawyer, wrote by email:*
***The settlement includes a monetary payment that is very large by Canadian standards for a defamation case. We were proud to represent Dr. Zucker in achieving a resounding success that in our view affirms not only his treatment approach but his professional reputation as a world leader in his field.***

>*Dr. Zucker, editor-in-chief of the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, helped shape the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual’s current definition of “gender dysphoria.” Following complaints local activists made to CAMH in 2014, he was investigated by two independent assessors with little experience in childhood gender issues.* ***After his removal in December 2015, though, more than 500 clinicians and researchers within the field signed an open letter to CAMH’s board of trustees, expressing “dismay” at Dr. Zucker’s dismissal and defending his integrity and his “outstanding” contribution to the field.***

>*Though he will sometimes recommend social and medical transition for his patients, Dr. Zucker is guided by the general principle that congruence between a patient’s gender identity and birth sex is the ideal outcome. This approach is informed by decades of case-by-case clinical practice and a small but substantial body of research [...] suggesting that over two-thirds of children with gender dysphoria will realign with their birth sex by the end of adolescence if they have not been exposed to transition-based treatments.*

>***the American Academy of Pediatrics recently released a policy statement whose lead author is Dr. Jason Rafferty, who, according to the PubMed database, has no published papers on gender issues other than policy statements. Yet the statement — backed by activists and approved by a committee of 24 pediatricians and a maximum of twelve AAP board members (according to an AAP insider), and intended for use by the 67,000 member pediatricians — recommended a strikingly simplistic, one-size-fits-all gender-affirming approach for “transgender” youth.***

>*When Dr. James Cantor of Sexology Today! fact-checked the policy statement, however, he discovered that* ***many of the sources it cited directly contradicted claims made in the document itself. Dr. Zucker, whose work is not cited once despite his authority, also said that the AAP statement was “shockingly bad scholarship” and that it makes bold assertions where the research literature is weak or nonexistent.***

>***Zucker calls attention to Temple Newhook’s obfuscation of the effects of socially transitioning of pre-pubescent children.*** *He writes: 
“I would hypothesize that when more follow-up data of children who socially transition prior to puberty become available, the persistence rate will be extremely high. This is not a value judgment—it is simply an empirical prediction . . .* ***parents who support, implement, or encourage a gender social transition (and clinicians who recommend one) are implementing a psychosocial treatment that will increase the odds of long-term persistence.”***

>*Taking the “desistance myth” and inverting it perfectly, Zucker shows how the Temple Newhook commentary speaks against desistance by pushing social transition...*

***

>###**The “desistance myth” is no myth—**

>*[In 2016, transgender advocate Brynn Tannehill wrote in the Huffington Post about the “desistance myth,”](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2018/07/21972/) attempting to discredit a dozen studies that demonstrate that a majority of children identifying as transgender cease do to so as they enter adulthood. Tannehill believes that desistance is a fiction “built upon bad statistics, bad science, homophobia and transphobia.”* ***Yet Tannehill never defines these terms, nor does she validate these accusations with any proof. Even so, this false narrative—that desistance is a myth—has become part of the transgender lobby’s push to medicalize gender non-conforming children.***

>*The evidence is clear: the “desistance myth” is no myth. The consistent findings about gender-dysphoria desistance are real, to the chagrin of the more militant transgender advocates. When the evidence is studied, it is clear that the dissemination of the “desistance myth” is an attempt to render scientific truths fictional. It also works to de-emphasize the dangers of social transition that pushes the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.*

My goal is to report on underreported stories and angles; to fight censorship and narratives. Favored issues include: whistleblowers, national security, government and corporate corruption, waste/fraud/abuse of taxpayer money, media ethics, fraudulent charities, border issues. I try to bring to light facts and views that powerful interests want to cover up.

I've been accused of being liberal, and there's also been an orchestrated campaign by various interests to portray me as conservative and anti-vaccine. In fact, most of my stories don't involve political topics (though it seems, today, most everything can be made into one). I've been nominated for a dozen or so Emmy awards for nonpolitical work investigating topics such as the Red Cross, Firestone Tires, taxpayer waste and medicine and vaccine adverse events. I try to be fair, I open my mind and follow the facts, and I work hard to suspend m own personal opinions from the stories I do.

My goal isn't to try to convince you or tell you what to believe; I want to bring to light little known facts and information. What you do with them is your business.

>Last week, a Denver man was [arrested and charged with multiple felonies](http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28561686/denver-da-charges-man-tampering-handing-out-jury), but not for stealing, committing fraud, or engaging in violent crime. 

>He was targeted for attempting to educate jurors about their rights in the courtroom.

>Mark Ianicelli, 56, set up a table outside of Lindsay-Flanigan Courthouse in Denver in order to educate jurors about jury nullification. Jury nullification is the process by which [members of juries can nullify unjust laws](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/nullification.html) by finding defendants charged with them not guilty.

>Ianicelli is charged with tampering with a jury, a felony in Colorado that carries a minimum bond of $5,000. He was charged by the Denver District Attorney for *seven* counts of tampering, and has since bailed out of jail. 

>Ianicelli was in the second day of a planned three-day outreach to educate jurors entering the courtroom about the power of jury nullification. He was handing out fliers when he was arrested. His goal was to inform potential jurors about a vital, centuries-old function of juries.

>The practice was first used in America in 1735 to [exonerate a man of libel charges after he printed unflattering statements](http://www.personal.psu.edu/jph13/JuryNullification.html) about the Governor of New York (a British colony at the time). 

>Though he had undoubtedly printed them, the jury found him not guilty and set the precedent that members of juries could judge the morality and legitimacy of laws.

>The United States’ first Chief Justice, John Jay, once [told jurors](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/nullification.html), “You have a right to take upon yourselves to judge [both the facts and law].” Jurors would seize this right to nullify [anti-sedition laws](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/nullification.html) in the early 1800s that attempted to stifle free speech criticizing the newly formed United States government.

>Judges first began [cracking down on the right to nullify](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/nullification.html) in the late 1800s. 

>By that time, jurors had already used nullification to challenge the [Fugitive Slave Act](http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/fugitive-slave-acts), which imposed heavy punishment on Northerners who aided escaped slaves from the South. Though judges came to discourage nullification, the practice went on to be useful in nullifying Prohibition-era laws.

>Jury nullification still affects prohibition against outlawed drugs. In 2012, [a New Hampshire jury acquitted a Rastafarian man](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/17/doug-darrell-marijuana-jury-nullification_n_1890824.html), Doug Darrell, of growing marijuana—though he was technically guilty of the violation. 

>The jurors had been informed of their right to nullify and found the law and charges against Darrell to be unjust. They found him not guilty.

>However, this power of the people has not gone unchecked. Though [some states allow for the practice](http://www.personal.psu.edu/jph13/JuryNullification.html), judges often [fail to notify jurors](http://www.personal.psu.edu/jph13/JuryNullification.html) of their ability to nullify. 

>Activists have been [harassed and jailed](http://www.activistpost.com/2013/02/jury-nullification-activist-jailed-145.html) for attempting to inform jurors of their right to judge the morality of laws.

>The [Fully Informed Jury Association](http://fija.org/) (FIJA), a non-profit organization that educates jurors on their rights (and whose pamphlets Ianicelli was handing out when he was arrested), is one group that attempts to counter these suppressions by the justice system.

>Kirsten Tynan of FIJA [reported on Ianicelli’s case](http://fija.org/2015/07/28/man-sharing-jury-nullification-information-arrested-in-denver/), stating that officials in Denver claimed a juror had complained about Ianicelli’s presence near the courthouse, prompting his arrest. Tynan was told Ianicelli was arrested on charges of jury tampering, which according to Colorado law, consists of:

1. A person commits jury-tampering if, with intent to influence a juror’s vote, opinion, decision, or other action in a case, he attempts directly or indirectly to communicate with a juror other than as a part of the proceedings in the trial of the case.

2. A person commits jury-tampering if he knowingly participates in the fraudulent processing or selection of jurors or prospective jurors.

3. Jury-tampering is a class 5 felony; except that jury-tampering in any class 1 felony trial is a class 4 felony.”

>Though Tynan acknowledged that under some circumstances nullification activism is not legally permissible, it appears Ianicelli was within his rights. He is due back in court on August 11 to face his victimless felony charges.

>It is more than alarming that a man attempting to facilitate and strengthen the judicial process is punished with the full force of the law—the very thing Ianicelli sought to educate jurors about. 

>As Harlan F. Stone, the 12th Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court [said](http://www.personal.psu.edu/jph13/JuryNullification.html) in 1941, “The law itself is on trial quite as much as the cause which is to be decided.”

Know its a lot of text, but there's a lot to link together here to paint the full picture. After seeing a thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bong6/working_theory_according_to_rod_wheeler_pi/) that Amy Dacey might be a key person at DNC connected to Seth since she was his boss while he was working on the Voter App project, I searched back through the wiki podesta files to see if she came up and YES SHE DID. Im going to start here and connect it all back to Seth and how she might be a key player in all this.

Rewind back to 2007, Amy worked for SEIU and has a LONG history of working with Podesta. Here's an email about a meeting she set up with lots of names we will recognize (hint: Ballsack Eyes!) https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40160
(note: This email has Amy Dacey setting up a meeting between Soros and Co. Herb and Marion Sandler are listed in that meeting. Herb Sandler is the person who wrote the email to Podesta asking if he'd do better playing dominoes on cheese or on pasta.)

She moved to the Government Relations Dept with SEIU: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26012 And she also was Executive Director at Fund for America working with the same crowd: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/24363
She then went on to be CEO of the DNC and was leading the investigation into the voter database compromise that happened in December 15. Tl;dr for those that dont remember: the dnc voter database was compromised and Bernie campaign ended up w voter info from Hillarys campaign. They had NGA VAN do a few audits to find what was compromised and reported the results and who was responsible in the Bernie campaign for accessing info they weren't supposed to. The director of voter data for the Bernie campaign was fired as a result. This is the report she sent out after the initial audit: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15792 At the end of this report, she refers to continuing the audit which is when I think they might have initially discovered Seth as a leaker. The DNC has also instructed NGP VAN to conduct a review process of their internal procedures to identify how this mistake was allowed to happen and prevent further such mistakes. The DNC is currently beginning the process of securing an additional, independent audit by a data security firm of NGP VAN’s procedures.

As a result of this analysis, NGP VAN found that campaign staff on the Sanders campaign, including the campaign’s national data director, had accessed proprietary information about which voters were being targeted by the Clinton campaign — and in doing so violated their agreements with the DNC. After discovering, he accessed things he shouldn't have and suspected him, then that could have lead to the unmasking hunch everyone has for further surveillance. If that is the case then perhaps this NGP VAN is also a point of research as they would have played a part in uncovering this? Other important note: he was working on the voter app project for dnc when he discovered the fraudulent voting sites issue, which was reportedly one of his motivations to work with Wikileaks. If you read the emails exchanges during the Bernie/DNC Voter Compromise, the Hillary campaign wanted to know the ""ACTUAL DAMAGE"" of the compromise perhaps afraid the fraud would be discovered? https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35361

According to a few news articles Seth made the exchange to this ex MI6 agent that now works with Wikileaks in September. http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/14/craig-murray-says-source-of-hillary-clinton-campai/ Important because if we was exchanging info back in September and continuing through this ongoing audit/investigation which started in December then it could've been discovered during that.

So — I’ve been silent for some weeks. Forgive me.

The truth is: I’ve been rendered almost speechless — or the literary equivalent of that — because in the last little while I’ve had the unenviable task of trying to announce to the world that indeed, a genocide — or what I’ve called, clumsily but urgently, a “baby die-off” — is underway.

The WarRoom/DailyClout Pfizer Documents Research Volunteers, a group of 3000 highly credentialled doctors, RNs, biostatisticians, medical fraud investigators, lab clinicians and research scientists, have been turning out report after report, as you may know, to tell the world what is in the 55,000 internal Pfizer documents which the FDA had asked a court to keep under wraps for 75 years. By court order, these documents were forcibly disclosed. And our experts are serving humanity by reading through these documents and explaining them in lay terms. You can find all of the Volunteers’ reports on DailyClout.io.

The lies revealed are stunning.

The WarRoom/DailyClout Volunteers have confirmed: that Pfizer (and thus the FDA) knew by December 2020 that the MRNA vaccines did not work — that they “waned in efficacy” and presented “vaccine failure.” One side effect of getting vaccinated, as they knew by one month after the mass 2020 rollout, was “COVID.”

Pfizer knew in May of 2021 that 35 minors’ hearts had been damaged a week after MRNA injection — but the FDA rolled out the EUA for teens a month later anyway, and parents did not get a press release from the US government about heart harms til August of 2021, after thousands of teens were vaccinated. \[[https://dailyclout.io/pfizer-vaccine-fda-fails-to-mention-risk-of-heart-damage-in-teens/\]](https://dailyclout.io/pfizer-vaccine-fda-fails-to-mention-risk-of-heart-damage-in-teens/])

Pfizer (and thus the FDA; many of the documents say “FDA: CONFIDENTIAL” at the lower boundary) knew that, contrary to what the highly paid spokesmodels and bought-off physicians were assuring people, the MRNA, spike protein and lipid nanoparticles did not stay in the injection side in the deltoid, but rather went, within 48 hours into the bloodstream, from there to lodge in the liver, spleen, adrenals, lymph nodes, and, if you are a woman, in the ovaries. \[[https://dailyclout.io/internal-pfizer-documents-prove-knowledge-that-lipid-nanoparticles-in-mice-subjects-do-not-remain-in-muscle-but-were-shown-to-be-rapidly-distributed-in-the-blood-to-the-liver/\]](https://dailyclout.io/internal-pfizer-documents-prove-knowledge-that-lipid-nanoparticles-in-mice-subjects-do-not-remain-in-muscle-but-were-shown-to-be-rapidly-distributed-in-the-blood-to-the-liver/])

Pfizer (and thus the FDA) knew that the Moderna vaccine had 100 mcg of MRNA, lipid nanoparticles and spike protein, which amount was more than three times the 30 mcg of the adult Pfizer dose; the company’s internal documents show a higher rate of adverse events with the 100 mcg dose, so they stopped experimenting with that amount internally due to its “reactogenicity” — Pfizer’s words — but no one told all of the millions of Americans who all got the first and second 100 mcg Moderna dose, *and the boosters —* that the 100 mcg dose was proven to be damaging, so to maybe skip the booster, or slow it all down.

Pfizer skewed the trial subjects so that almost three quarters were female — a gender that is less prone to cardiac damage. Pfizer *lost* the records of what became of hundreds of their trial subjects.

In the internal trials, there were over 42,000 adverse events and more than 1200 people died. Four of the people who died, *died on the day they were injected.*

Adverse events tallied up in the internal Pfizer documents are completely different from those reported on the CDC website or announced by fully corrupted physicians and medical organizations and hospitals. They include vast columns of joint pain, muscle pain (myalgia), masses of neurological effects include MS, Guillaine Barre and Bell’s Palsy, encephaly, every iteration possible of blood clotting, thrombocytopenia at scale, strokes, hemorrhages, and many kinds of ruptures of membranes throughout the human body. The side effects about which Pfizer and the FDA knew but you did not, include blistering problems, rashes, shingles, and herpetic conditions (indeed, a range of blistering conditions oddly foreshadowing the symptoms of monkeypox).

The internal documents show that Pfizer (and thus the FDA) knew that angry red welts or hives were a common reaction to the PEG, a petroleum-derived allergen in the vaccine ingredients — one that you are certainly not supposed to ingest. Indeed, PEG is an allergen so severe that many people can go into anaphylactic shock if they are exposed to it. But people with a PEG allergy were not warned away from the vaccines or even carefully watched by their doctors, EpiPen in hand, post-vaccination. They were left to their shock.

Pfizer knew that “exposure” to the vaccine was defined — in their own words - as sexual contact (especially at time of conception), skin contact, inhalation or lactation. \[[https://dailyclout.io/vaccine-shedding-can-this-be-real-after-all/\]](https://dailyclout.io/vaccine-shedding-can-this-be-real-after-all/]). Fact-checkers can deny this all they want. The documents speak for themselves.

Of course, people who have tried to raise any of these issues have been deplatformed, scolded by the President, called insane, and roundly punished.

Athletes and college students and teenagers are collapsing on football and soccer fields. Doctors wring their hands and express mystification. But BioNTech’s SEC filing shows a fact about which the CDC and the AMA breathe not a word: fainting so violently that you may hurt yourself is one of the disclosed side effects important enough for BioNTech to highlight to the SEC.

But not to highlight to you and me.

I was able to process all of this and keep simply reporting. But in the last few weeks the horror has overcome me. Because in the last few weeks the Volunteers, under the excellent leadership of Program Manager Amy Kelly, have confirmed that there is a genocide underway, intentionally driven or not. And Israeli journalist Etana Hecht has added her own superb analysis. Here is Ms Hecht’s summary of the Volunteers’ findings:

[**Clown World - HonkVaccinated Women**The topic of pregnant and nursing moms getting vaccinated under encouragement and coercion is painful. It’s painful to research, painful to write about, and painful to learn how carelessly the most precious among us are being treated.

It seems that there can indeed be a happenstance genocide. Reproduction itself is targeted, intentionally or not, by the mRNA vaccines. And if you know that reproduction is harmed, and babies and fetuses are harmed, and you know that this at scale, which everyone at Pfizer and at the FDA who read these documents, knew —and you do not stop — does that not ultimately become a genocide?

The WarRoom/DailyClout volunteers have confirmed that lipid nanoparticles, the tiny hard fatty casings that contains the MRNA, traverse the amniotic membrane. That means that they enter the fetal environment, of course. (They also traverse the blood-brain barrier, which may help explain the post-MRNA vaccination strokes and cognitive issues we are seeing). The Volunteers have drilled deep into the Pfizer document’s reports about pregnancy and found that the assurance that the vaccine is “safe and effective” for pregnant women, was based on a study of 44 French rats, followed for 42 days (the scientists who ran the study are shareholders or employees of BioNTech). \[[https://dailyclout.io/covid-19-vaccines-pregnancy-risky-business/\]](https://dailyclout.io/covid-19-vaccines-pregnancy-risky-business/])

The Volunteers found that while pregnant women were excluded from the internal studies, and thus from the EUA on which basis all pregnant women were assured the vaccine was “safe and effective”, nonetheless about 270 women got pregnant during the study. More than 230 of them were lost somehow to history. But of the 36 pregnant women whose outcomes were followed - *28 lost their babies.*

The Volunteers found that a baby died after nursing from a vaccinated lactating mother, and was found to have had an inflamed liver. Many babies nursing from vaccinated mothers showed agitation, gastrointestinal distress, and failure to thrive (to grow), and were inconsolable.

I am hearing anecdotal reports of these symptoms in babies nursing from vaccinated mothers, now, from across the country.

The Pfizer documents also show that some vaccinated mothers had suppressed lactation, or could produce no milk at all.

Doctors, of course, are stumped by all this. Stumped.

The NIH database has a preprint study making the case that there are negligible amounts of PEG in the breast milk of vaccinated women. \[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351783/\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351783/])

But what is a negligible amount of a petroleum product in mother’s milk, when you are a tiny newborn with no immunities, just arriving in the world? The NIH preprint itself reported higher levels of GI distress and sleeplessness in the infants studied, and one mother had elevated PEG levels in breast milk, and the fine print concludes that more study is needed:

“Larger studies are needed to increase our understanding of transfer of PEG into human milk, and potential effects after ingestion by the infant. Although expert consensus states there is minimal or no potential risk for the infant from maternal COVID-19 vaccination([20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351783/#R20),[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351783/#R21)), the minor symptoms that were reported (sleep changes and gastrointestinal symptoms) could be further investigated in future studies to determine if they are related to vaccination.”

Since no babies *died* in the brief time frame of the tiny study, the study concluded that nursing babies suffered no real ill effects from vaccinated mothers. But the study did not follow these poor babies, with their acknowledged sleeplessness and their confirmed GI distress, to see if they actually “thrived” — gained weight and developed normally.

On such faulty science were women assured that the vaccines were “safe and effective” for them and their nursing babies.

But — four of the lactating vaccinated women in the Pfizer documents reported “blue-green” breast milk. I am not making this up. And the nursing baby who died, with an inflamed liver — the case has been buried; has not made headlines.

Coincidentally — or not — the SAME FDA that turned a blind eye to vast harms to humans, and to the subcategory of moms and babies, in the Pfizer documents, declared that Abbot, a major producer of baby formula in the US, had to close its factory. \[[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/16/abbott-reaches-agreement-with-fda-to-reopen-baby-formula-plant-to-ease-nationwide-shortage.html\]](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/16/abbott-reaches-agreement-with-fda-to-reopen-baby-formula-plant-to-ease-nationwide-shortage.html])

Coincidentally, with little formula available and with some or many (we don’t know) vaccinated moms having compromised breast milk, it turns out that Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Mark Zuckerberg have all invested in a startup called ""BioMilq” — which produces lab grown breast milk from mammary cells. \[[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/biomilq-raises-3point5-million-from-bill-gates-investment-firm.html\]](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/biomilq-raises-3point5-million-from-bill-gates-investment-firm.html]). Reports of this startup include this Frankenstein-like language *as if this is normal*: “The BIOMILQ team creates its product from cells taken from human breast tissue and milk, donated by women in the local community, who get a Target giftcard in return.” \[[https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/business/lab-grown-human-milk-biomilq-health-climate-hnk-spc-intl/index.html\]](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/business/lab-grown-human-milk-biomilq-health-climate-hnk-spc-intl/index.html])

As if all of this is not horrific enough, Ms Hecht drew studies from three countries — Canada, Scotland and now Israel - -to show that babies are dying disproportionately, during and after 2021, in highly vaccinated countries, and that newborns are dying disproportionately if they have vaccinated mothers versus unvaccinated mothers.

In highly vaccinated Scotland, almost twice the number of babies died in 2021 as died in baseline numbers. \[[https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19726487.investigation-launched-abnormal-spike-newborn-baby-deaths-scotland/\]](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19726487.investigation-launched-abnormal-spike-newborn-baby-deaths-scotland/]). In Ontario, Canada, 86 babies died in 2021, versus a baseline of four or five; this was a baby die-off so severe that a brave Parliamentarian brought the issue to Parliament. \[[https://nonvenipacem.com/2021/12/10/explosive-rise-in-ontario-stillbirths-triggers-parliamentary-questions/\]](https://nonvenipacem.com/2021/12/10/explosive-rise-in-ontario-stillbirths-triggers-parliamentary-questions/]).

In Israel, at RamBam Hospital in Haifa, there were 34% more spontaneous abortions and stillbirths to vaccinated women as to unvaccinated women.

Ms Hecht also notes that menstrual dysregulation in vaccinated women is fully confirmed now by many studies, with an average of one extra day of bleeding a month (a side effect about which I warned about in March of 2021, which in turn got me called names by a CNN commentator and permanently deplatformed from Twitter).

You don’t have to know more than eighth grade biology to know that a dysregulated menstrual cycle, not to mention spike protein accumulating in the ovaries, not to mention the traversing of the bodies’ membranes, including the amniotic sac, by tiny hard fatty lipid nanoparticles, not to mention PEG in breast milk, is all going to affect fertility, fetal health, childbirth, and babies’ GI wellbeing or distress, and thus their ability or failure to thrive (let alone bond).

And now, the babies are dying. Now scale the data from Canada, Scotland and Israel to all the vaccinated nations in the world.

What do we do with all of this?

Knowing as I now do, that Pfizer and the FDA knew that babies were dying and mothers’ milk discoloring by just looking at their own internal records; knowing as I do that they did not alert anyone let alone stop what they were doing, and that to this day Pfizer, the FDA and other demonic “public health” entities are pushing to MRNA-vaccinate more and more pregnant women; now that they are about to force this on women in Africa and other lower income nations who are not seeking the MRNA vaccines, per Pfizer CEO Bourla this past week at the WEF, and knowing that Pfizer is pushing and may even receive a US EUA for babies to five year olds — I must conclude that we are looking into an abyss of evil not see since 1945.

So I don’t know about you, but I must switch gears with this kind of unspeakable knowledge to another kind of discourse.

I am not saying that this is exactly like finding evidence of Dr Mengele’s experiments, a comparison that has been excessive in the recent past; but I am saying, with these findings, that now the comparison may not be that excessive. These demons at Pfizer, speaking at the WEF; these demons at the FDA; knowing what they know; are targeting the miraculous female body, with its ability to conceive, gestate, birth and nurture life. They are targeting the female body’s ability to sustain a newborn human being with nothing but itself. They are targeting the amniotic membrane, the ovaries that release the ovum, they are targeting the lymph and blood that help support the building up of mother’s milk, they are targeting the fetus in utero, helpless.

They are targeting the human fetus’ very environment, one of the most sacred spaces on this earth, if not the most sacred.

*And they know it.*

I don’t know about you, and I am not proselytizing, but as you may know if you read me here, these apocalyptic days, I turn to prayer. I have started to say in public, once I had to face the fact of the die-off of the babies, that this is a Biblical time; and I mean Old Testament Biblical.

It is a time like the times that saw the construction of the Tower of Babel — a time of massive human arrogance against divine plans; a time when men such Bill Gates tamper with and seek to outdo God’s best works in lab after lab, and a time of Tech Bros “disrupting” the human competition for their unsought-after goods and services, by targeting human processes and by ruining the human bodies made in the image of God.

It is a time of plagues like the ten plagues that assailed the Egyptians in Exodus 11:4-6:

**“4** So Moses said, “This is what the Lord says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.**5** Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. **6** There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. **7”**

This was the worst plague of all, the slaying of the firstborn.

It is a time of *ha-Satan* — Satan — “going to and fro in the earth, and \[…\] walking up and down in it”, as Job 2 describes him; *ha-Satan* having his way with us.

It is a time of demons sauntering around in human spaces, though they are demons who sit looking human enough themselves, smug and smiling in their Italian suits on panels at the World Economic Forum.

*Ha-Satan* \- and his armies: ruining the conception, the milk, the menses, the touch, the cradling of the infant by its mother, ruining the feeding of the infant; ruining the babies themselves.

I read the Prophets a lot these days — because how could I not? I am looking for what writer Annie Lamott called “Operating Instructions.” What do you do when humanity itself is threatened? When there are professional battalions and bureaucratic departments of people who act like demons, acting with anathema toward the human race?

Surely there must be a clue.

So I pay attention to other times in our Western story, when humans were faced with a genocide. I reread the story of Noah, and the Book of Esther, a lot these days; I reread Jeremiah.

We’ve been here before. Embarrassingly often, when it comes to that.

The story is always the same, at least in the Hebrew Bible (in the New Testament, of course, God skips to the end and upends the plot).

At least in the Hebrew Bible, God is always trying to get our attention, always, it seems, simply asking us just to walk alongside him; simply asking us to keep his not--too-challenging commandments; not, indeed, asking a lot.

**Jeremiah 1:13:**

**“** The word of the Lord came to me again: “What do you see?”

“I see a pot that is boiling,” I answered. “It is tilting toward us from the north.”

**14** The Lord said to me, “From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land. **15** I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms,” declares the Lord.

“Their kings will come and set up their thrones    in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem;they will come against all her surrounding walls    and against all the towns of Judah.**16** I will pronounce my judgments on my people    because of their wickedness in forsaking me,in burning incense to other gods    and in worshiping what their hands have made.”

In the Hebrew Bible, anyway, the math is simple. We turn, we listen, and we are saved; or we carry on heedlessly, worshipping what our own hands have made, sluts to other gods — to “the science,” to media lies, to the narcissism of convention, these days, one might say — and thus we are lost.

We have been nearly lost, time after time after time.

This time could really be the last time; these monsters in the labs, these demons on the transnational panels, are so very skillful; and so powerful; and their dark work is so extensive.

If God is there — again — after all the times that we have tried his patience — and who indeed knows? Will we reach out a hand to him in return, take hold in the last moment out of this abyss, and simply find a way somehow to walk alongside him?

Or will we this time, in losing the babies, and heedlessly carrying on nonetheless — be — truly lost?

212,"Financing a breakaway civilization: A series of scandals involving allegedly counterfeit ""bearer bonds"" make up the biggest and most under-reported financial story of the 21st century. I've attempted to summarize these events for /r/conspiracy's consumption in the following analysis.",458.0,1qnth3,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1qnth3/financing_a_breakaway_civilization_a_series_of/,145.0,1384480657.0,"The following is absurdly long because it needs to be. /r/conspiracy has given some attention to pieces of this story, but there never has been a comprehensive overview of the subject here, so I thought I would make an attempt.

Although I'm including links to several different sources, including from “mainstream” as well as alternative media, the majority of the analysis I'm presenting here comes from the research of [Joseph P. Farrell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Farrell), a writer on topics like alternative archaeology, physics, technology, history, and other “strange stuff”. I've also made /r/josephpfarrell for some of his videos and blogs, many of which I will be quoting from in the following analysis.

To being with, here's a brief overview of three essential methodological assumptions of any counterfeiting scheme:

1. One does not counterfeit something that does not currently exist as a medium of exchange, or that is not convertible into it. One only counterfeits, or mimics, something real.

2. Similarly, one does not counterfeit 500, 1,000 or 10,000 dollar bills. One only counterfeits what one can reasonably expect to tender to a target group, and thus must tailor its counterfeit function to the target's scale of affluence, and do so without raising suspicion.

3. One must produce a product of sufficient quality to pass the scrutiny of the target group. One does not go to the expense and effort of producing a fraudulent product that cannot be used because it does not exist, is too large a denomination to be traded with the target group, or is too poor in quality to be traded. Quality must be sufficiently high to ensure first sight acceptance of its authenticity.

Things change a bit when the target group is very wealthy, as securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) become the preferred method. Also, a wealthy target group is likely to be privy to the existence of instruments most don't know exist, and can call upon private intelligence resources to verify information. 

But the point remains, one does not counterfeit what does not exist. And an addendum: *One does not counterfeit something that the very wealthy do not suspect exists, or know to exist.*

Before delving into the various bearer bonds scandals, it's important to mentioned a very relevant historical antecedent to these recent events, namely an extraordinary undertaking carried out by Nazi Germany. 

[Operation Bernhard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bernhard) was the largest counterfeiting operation in history. Its goal was to replicate the paper of English notes, copy the printing plates to reproduce the tiniest detail, and employ mathematicians to work out the Bank of England's numbering system.

Nazi Germany was trying to erect a hidden system of finance aimed at wrecking the British war economy...they were at war with the British financial elite. It's important to note the connection between financial fraud and intelligence bureaucracies. The SS had essentially created a *counterfeiting bureaucracy.*

All in all, and these are generally considered to be the most conservative numbers, Operation Bernhard produced a total of 7 million facsimile British pound notes during the war, totally a staggering 135 million pounds. Other estimates range well over 300 million pounds. 

Here are some important points about the implications of Operation Bernhard that are relevant to the rest of the discussion:

1. State-sponsored counterfeiting of undetectable facsimile banknotes had been successfully undertaken on an industrial scale, becoming a significant part of the money supply and were only removed with great difficulty.

2. Although conceived as economic warfare, it morphed into a virtually inexhaustible means of financing covert activities. Industrial scale counterfeiting became the link between covert operations and research projects.

3. Access to this type of funding could allow any intelligence bureaucracy and/or secret research entity to become independent of its controlling state and its financial institutions, whether public or private.

4. In the distribution of the facsimiles, it's necessary to have “neutral points of entry” into the circulation scheme. In the case of Operation Bernhard, Switzerland and the Vatican were used (remember those two places).

According to the research of Farrell, [Richard Dolan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dolan) and many others, industrial scale counterfeiting survived WWII to become the favored method of the independent financing of covert research and operations of what has become often referred to as a “breakaway civilization”. Operation Bernhard survived WWII, at least conceptually, as well as the accompanying Fascist ideology.

According to Farrell, the major factional structure of this breakaway civilization, as far as finances are concerned, are composed of the following:

1. A “rogue” element within the American military-industrial-intelligence-finance complex with ties to similar oligarchical interests in Great Britain, Japan, Germany, France, etc.

2. The international criminal underground (Cosa Nostra/the Mafia).

3. The international Fascist element, or what Farrell refers to as the “Nazi International”.

To introduce the next section, here's an excerpt from an article called [Parallel World of Finances](http://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2013/02/13/parallel-world-of-finances-i.html) that continues to discuss the various incidents concerning bearer bonds:

>The invisible financial world is something the majority of people have no idea of. The major part of it is the shadow sector of world financial system, financial institutes and financial operations conducted under the cover of off-shores and falling out of the sight of financial regulators (central banks, ministries of finances, and security and exchange commissions). One can only guess how large it is, there is no way to have a clear picture of what it is like because all the activities are conducted beyond any supervision. No books are kept, and no accounting before state structures exists. 

>The world dwellers are criminal gangs related to drug trafficking, arms trade, slave trade and so on. It’s not even grey sector activities, but rather “black” economy breaching all norms of penal law. According to experts, the turnover is a few trillion dollars a year…Besides, the shadow sector encompasses various structures that do not hide underground. Many of them openly offer various services to individuals and corporations.

And now, the bearer bonds. Here's a definition from the Wikipedia page on [bearer bonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearer_bond):

>A bearer bond is a debt security issued by a business entity, such as a corporation, or by a government. It differs from the more common types of investment securities in that it is unregistered--no records are kept of the owner, or the transactions involving ownership. Whoever physically holds the paper on which the bond is issued owns the instrument. This is useful for investors who wish to retain anonymity. Recovery of the value of a bearer bond in the event of its loss, theft, or destruction is usually impossible.

The first reported case of strangeness concerning the so-called “Morgenthau bonds” became public in 2003. [Henry Morgenthau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgenthau,_jr) was the US Secretary of the Treasury during the 1930's, when many of these bonds supposedly originated. 

From a BBC article: [Two men have been found guilty of conspiracy to defraud in a case related to fake US government bonds worth $2.5 trillion.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3116188.stm)

The individuals who were caught said the bonds were related to the “black gold” received from Chiang Kai-shek of China. The story hardly attracted any attention on the part of world media. The bonds were supposedly issued in 1934, a year that will continue to pop up. The word ""dollar"" was printed on the bonds instead of ""dollars"". Glaring typos on these various bonds will become a common theme as we explore further. 

The following article summarizes the implications of all these weird bond incidents: [Secret ""Occult Economy"" Coming Out of the Shadows?](http://www.activistpost.com/2012/03/secret-occult-economy-coming-out-of.html)

>Yet, although the bonds/notes in the Halksworth case were demonstrably false, they did reveal some rather startling information, that fake bonds were often included amongst large quantities of real bonds so as to preclude the holder from ever being able to cash them. 

>Indeed, when questioned by the police as to his role in the fake bond scandal, Halksworth responded by telling police that “Deliberate mistakes were often made in such bonds as a security device; ask the CIA.” When the police pointed out that the mistakes were so obvious it looked like a child had made them, Halksworth responded, “Exactly.”

[Farrell continues with an analysis on this story here.](http://gizadeathstar.com/2012/03/the-fake-bearer-bonds-another-take/)

>So, ye olde plotte thickens, for now we have the involvement of someone with expertise precisely in such bonds and their authentication, alleging that mistakes were deliberately made as “security devices” and that the CIA was involved in this, clearly implying a hidden economy connection.

*The Japanese Bearer Bond Scandal*: [Mystery surrounding 134.5 “fake” billion US dollars seized in Ponte Chiasso remains](http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=15556)

This story is significant enough to be mentioned on the Wikipedia page for bearer bonds:

>In June 2009, Italian financial police and custom guards seized documents purporting to be U.S. bearer bonds, totaling $134.5 billion. The bonds were in $500 million and $1 billion denominations, although the highest denomination ever issued by the US Treasury was $1,000,000. It was unclear what the purpose of the fake bonds was; the two men carrying them were not detained after the bonds were seized.

Now if that doesn't raise some questions...here are some more articles on the subject:

[Strange Inconsistencies in the $134.5 Billion Bearer Bond Mystery](http://seekingalpha.com/article/143462-strange-inconsistencies-in-the-134-5-billion-bearer-bond-mystery)

[Update on the Japanese Bearer Bond story, with pictures of the bonds and “certificate of authenticity”](http://gizadeathstar.com/2011/07/an-update-on-the-japanese-bearer-bond-story/)

From the first of Farrell's articles:

>There were 249 bearer bonds were in denominations of $500,000,000, with ten so-called “Kennedy bonds” each denominated at a value of $1,000,000,000. Some of the $500,000,000 bonds were dated as far back as 1934. 

>This is where the plot begins to thicken. For one thing, bonds of $500,000,000 denominations did not exist (so we’re told) in 1934, and thus they were deduced to be counterfeits, though, strangely, the Italian authorities at the time of the arrest were waiting for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to make a declaration as to their authenticity.

>Moreover, we are informed by a number of internet articles and posts, Bloomberg for example, on this bizarre episode that the bonds were all so well-executed that they were “indistinguishable from the real ones.” 

>J.S. Kim, in his post on the subject “Strange Inconsistencies in the $134.5 Billion Bearer Bond Mystery,” asks a pertinent question: How can this quality be so good, and “yet the people involved in the alleged forgery be so ill-informed as not to date the bearer bonds with a more recent year that would not immediately identify them as fraudulent?”

>The second problem, noted by Kim in his article, is that the $1,000,000,000 denominated “Kennedy bonds” were never known to exist at all. “This discovery defies any logical explanation. Why would expert counterfeiters make 249 bearer bonds with denominations of $500 million apiece, each indistinguishable from the real thing, and then instead of just making 20 more such bonds, decide to make 10 bonds in denominations of $1 billion apiece in a bearer bond design that never has existed? Were the alleged counterfeiters just too lazy to confirm if Kennedy bearer bonds were ever a legitimately issued security? Again, this story makes no sense.”

The number 134.5 billion should be eerily familiar as well:
On March 30, 2009, the US Treasury Department stated that the Troubled Asset Relief Program had $134.5 billion remaining, the exact amount of the “stash” seized in Italy.

>This fact led some to speculate that, in fact, the bonds, including the so-called Kennedy bearer bonds, were real, but that they had been secretly issued by elements in the American government to keep the economy afloat. Others continued to maintain the counterfeit story. Some began to advance the argument that the Treasury’s announcement in March of 2009 would have allowed two months for forgers to counterfeit the exact amount of bonds and then allow them to be caught, in a murky economic warfare operation.

Are the Kennedy bonds real? Are all these bonds really counterfeit? If they are, the fact they are such excellent copies suggests that whoever was behind it ultimately had to be a nation-state or *someone* in possession of the genuine article. If they are based on secret “exemplars” then a clear message is being sent to whoever is secretly issuing these bonds: We know the game. 

It took US officials two weeks to make a public statement that they were counterfeit. It definitely rattled some people in high up places. Even if they were fakes, they were based on something real that the financial powers did not wish to be known.

I remember a story about French post-modern philosophers in the 1970s, who received a document from a renowned physicist who pranked them. He took all their, what Chomsky calls, unintelligibly garbled reasoning, and he rearranged and regurgitated all those fine words and blessed them with a kiss. That kiss was a tacit endorsement of their reasoning. They forgot to verify and corroborate what the physicist said before publishing it. They looked like fools.

At first I thought the slush fund thing was a non-issue and that the Justice Department was employing discretion explicitly granted by Congress, but apparently this is not the case.  The Justice Department has been systematically reducing the amount of fines during settlement on the condition that the defendant agreed to donate some or all of the penalized amount to preferred interest groups.  The Justice Department does this by exploiting a loophole in the Miscellaneous Receipts Act in a way that is a clear violation of Congress's appropriations power under the Separation of Powers doctrine.

> In particular, DOJ has the power ‘‘to short circuit the Miscellaneous Receipts Act by agreeing to settlement terms that require the viola- tor of a Federal statute to undertake certain responsibilities or ac- tions that might inure to the benefit of the executive branch.’’ Thus, the Department could effectively ‘‘augment the appropria- tions of the Executive Branch without running afoul of the tech- nical requirements of the Miscellaneous Receipts Act—although creating an unconstitutional interference with Congress’ appropria- tions power.’’ (see under [Background and the Need for Legislation](https://www.congress.gov/114/crpt/hrpt694/CRPT-114hrpt694.pdf) in the bill passed by the House in September 2016).

This is a practice that Democrats have wanted the executive power to employ since the 1980s, for the purpose of funding ""community service projects"" using funds that had not been expressly appropriated by Congress.  Nor had Congress expressly granted authority to the executive branch to use its discretion in choosing how those funds were to be allocated.

[According to Rep.

> In 2014, Bank of America was able to reduce a multi-billion dollar mortgage fraud penalty imposed by the DOJ by giving millions of dollars to liberal groups like National Urban League, The Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, and National Council of La Raza.

The scandal here is not whether this activity was expressly illegal.  To be clear, it was not.  The scandal arises from the clear partisan intention revealed by the practice of accepting fine reductions in exchange for donations to certain activist groups (whose activities the Democrats would have a political motive to support).  These deals were made at the expense of higher fine payments that would have been received by the Treasury.  These were politically-motivated settlement deals reached at the expense of the American public.",conspiracy,fraud

1. Trump is making a huge show about him trying to attack censorship on Twitter (I have a hard time believing that is the only goal) and creating headlines about his retweet about the only good democrat is a dead democrat. 

2. The police murder in minneapolis causing riots, instigated by undercover police, and protests, to the burning of over 100 businesses

0,Should calls to overthrow the election be considered illegal “campaign activity” if they were made by tax-exempt 503(c)(b) organizations prior to certification of the election?,1307.0,l0saal,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/l0saal/should_calls_to_overthrow_the_election_be/,215.0,1611087662.0,"A number of churches around the country openly called for the presidential election to be overthrown prior to the US Senate officially certifying the results. It seems that in years past, it was commonly accepted that campaigns ended when the polls closed. However, this year a sizable portion of the population aggressively asserted that the election would not be over until it was certified, even going as far as to violently interfere with the process.

Given this recent shift in the culture of politics, should calls to over-turn the election made by 501(c)(3) organizations prior to January 6th be considered ""campaign activity"" - effectively disqualifying them from tax-exempt status? Alternatively, if these organizations truly believed that wide-spread voter fraud took place, I suppose it could be argued that they were simply standing up for the integrity of our elections.

I know that even if a decent case could be made if favor of revoking the tax-exempt status of any 501(c)(3) organization that openly supported overthrowing the presidential election results, it is very unlikely that it any action would ever come of it. Nonetheless, I am interested in opinions.

(As an example, here are some excerpts from a  very politically charged church service given in St. Louis, MO on January 3rd, during which, among other things, they encouraged their congregation to call Senator Josh Hawley in support of opposing the certification.

Virtually every lawsuit by Trump-associated lawyers have been struck down hard and fast.

Yet, reading conservative sources, including some here, there is a sizable population that is certain the election was stolen, as does President Trump and others in his administration. Infowars, OANN and a host of conservative websites are beating the drum of election fraud.

I try to keep an open mind, and read the claims. For example, the recent claim that ""suitcases of fake ballots in Georgia were processed after sending poll watchers home."" I read the assertions, then the 'debunking,' and while the video and theory seemed plausible at first, reading the rebuttal --including the one in Forbes-- it looked pretty clear that assertions weren't true, and the responses made more sense than the conspiracy theory. That election officials in Georgia and people in the Republican governor's administration also dismissed the charges as untrue was sufficient for me, especially since they had every reason to want to agree with charges, including considerable pressure from Trump and his supporters. But it's not sufficient proof for those who believe the election was stolen by a vast conspiracy.

I know that the initial response from most about changing these folks' minds is that, ""you can't."" But if 50M people are convinced that the election was stolen, and that our election system is corrupt and unfixable... then they believe that the only way to ""restore"" the system is through martial law and militarily-supervised elections. That's pretty much what Michael Flynn and others are saying. That can't be the only fix. And if we can't convince them otherwise, this is a ticking time bomb for any number of bad things for America.

Most recently, president Trump held an hour long phone call with Georgia’s Republican secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, urging him to “find” the votes necessary to swing the state to Trump from Biden. Many Georgia lawmakers say Trump's actions violate Georgia state law by soliciting others to engage in election fraud.

Cheney has suggested former president could be charged with obstruction.

One of the three judges \[Amit B. Mehta\], had previosuly expressed concerns that it was unclear what conduct counted as felony “obstruction of an official proceeding” as opposed to misdemeanor disruption of a congressional hearing — a difference between a potential sentence of six months and 20 years behind bars. However, after months of consideration and legal arguments on both sides, Mehta ruled that the government had it right \[in filing the charges.\]

“Their alleged actions were no mere political protest,” he wrote. “They stand accused of combining, among themselves and with others, to force their way into the Capitol building, past security barricades and law enforcement, to ‘Stop, delay, and hinder the Certification of the Electoral College vote.”

Defendants had argued that it was unclear whether the certification of President Biden’s victory counted as an “official proceeding.” Charging participants in the Jan. 6 riot with obstruction, they warned, could turn even peaceful protesters into potential felons. Mehta said the “plain text” of the obstruction law covered the group’s actions, and that “even if there were a line of ambiguity ... their alleged acts went well beyond it.” Because the law requires the obstruction to be undertaken “corruptly,” he added, it does not imperil constitutionally protected free speech.

Another judge ruled the First Amendment right to free speech doesn’t protect four leaders of the right-wing Proud Boys group from criminal charges over their participation in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot. The men were properly charged with conduct that isn’t protected by the Constitution, including trespassing, destruction of property and interference with law enforcement -- all with the intention of obstructing Congress, U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly in Washington ruled Tuesday.

The ruling also has broader implications. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) has suggested former president Donald Trump could be charged with obstruction of an official proceeding.

Is it looking more likely that DOJ has a bigger goal than just charging the rioters and thniking about possibly charging the former president himself?

You can watch the hearings on C-SPAN, and elsewhere. This thread is about the sixth hearing, held today, June 28th, 2022.

[Today's hearing](https://www.c-span.org/video/?521387-1/sixth-hearing-investigation-capitol-attack) was a bit of a surprise, just announced the other day.

Cassidy Hutchinson, aide to Trump's Chief of Staff, Meadows testified. Ahead of January 6th, the capitol police and secret service had reports of potential violence, specifically from the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. On Jan 6th, security screening confiscated several weapons, including pepper spray, body armor, knives, and brass knuckles. There were also reports of multiple people armed with AR-15 style rifles, handguns, knives, and spears on the end of flagpoles in the crowd outside the security zone. Tony Ornato reported the weapons to Meadows. Response: ""Alright, anything else?"" without looking up from his phone. Meadows confirmed that Tony had also informed the President

Trump's speech on Jan 6th: Hirschman said it would be ""Foolish"" to include some phrases in the speech: ""fight for Trump...march to capitol...fight for me...I'll be with you...and things about the VP."", which he said not to include for legal concerns. Trump insisted on the language.

On morning of January 6th, Trump was ""furious"" that there weren't more people inside the security zone at the rally. He wanted the rally space to be full. Hutchinson was in the offstage tent with the President. He was angry that the secret service team wasn't letting people through with weapons. ""I don't f-ing care that they have weapons. They're not here to hurt me, take the f-ing mag(netometor)s away. Let my people in. They can march to the capitol from here."" Tony told President that people didn't want their weapons confiscated. Convo took place 2-3 minutes before he took the stage. Trump's speech: ""We're gonna walk down, and I'll be there with you...to the capitol..."".

As the crowd approached the capitol, it soon became apparent that security at the capitol would not be sufficient. Meadows was in a car on the phone, when Hutchinson tried to open the door to talk to him, he shut the door on her (twice). She said this was unusual. About 20 minutes later, she was able to tell him about the violence starting. Meadows: ""Alright, ...how much longer does the President have left in his speech?""

Different kinds of ""movement"" by POTUS:

\- Scheduled movement: On President's schedule, notification to the press, public, secret service and law enforcement coordination.

\- Off the record (OTR) movement: Confined to very small group of security and staff. Can be put together in \~1 hr.

Before Jan 6th, Trump wanted/planned to go to the capitol after his speech (scheduled movement), and told various people this. Cipollone told Hutchinson on Jan 3rd ""Make sure this doesn't happen. We have serious legal concerns if he does go to the capitol on Jan 6th."" Cipollone repeated this on Jan 6th. ""We're going to get charged with every crime imaginable."" Conversations w/ Cipollone leading up to the 6th revolved about liability for obstructing justice/interfering with the electoral count. Inciting a riot at the capitol. Before Jan 6th, Trump's team decided not to have a ""scheduled movement"" to the capitol.

On Jan 6th, Trump insisted on doing an OTR movement to the capitol after the speech. The secret service ""scrambled"" to try to support OTR movement. During speech, Kevin McCarthy called Hutchinson to tell her ""President said he was coming to the capitol, why did you lie to me? Figure it out, don't let him come up here."" Secret service & Meadows determined that Trump going to the capitol was ""impossible"". Presidential vehicle starts heading back to WH (\~1pm). Trump, while in the Presidential vehicle: ""I'm the f-ing President, take me to the Capitol."" Engel (driver?): ""We can't do that."" Trump reached for the wheel, lunged at Engel, grabbed his arm. (**Holy F-ing Shit!**). Trump blamed Meadows for not letting him go to the capitol.

Dec 1, 2020: Barr announced lack of evidence for election fraud. Trump was furious. Hutchinson heard ""noise"" from the hall. Meadows went to dining room, came back later. Hutchinson came to dining room later, valet pointed out shattered plate and ketchup bottle. Valet told her that Trump ""threw his lunch against the wall"" out of anger. **Holy F-ing Shit!** Hutchinson was aware of several other incidents of Trump throwing dishes and flipping tables.

Stone attended rallies on Jan 5th & 6th. Photographed with multiple members of the Oath Keepers. Stone & General Flynn took the 5th instead of testifying to committee. Both convicted criminals. Trump pardoned Flynn after presidential election, and commuted Stone's sentence. Trump asked Meadows to speak with Stone & Flynn on the 5th. Meadows called both of them evening of the 5th. She doesn't know what about. Giuliani, Eastman, and others set up ""war room"" at Willard hotel on night of the 5th. Meadows asked her to set up movement to Willard hotel that night. Hutchinson told him she didn't believe it was a ""smart"" idea. She didn't think it was appropriate. Meadows eventually said he would ""dial in"" instead.

Cheney: ""General Flynn, do you believe violence on January 6th was justified, morally, legally?"" Flynn: ""I take the fifth"".

During Jan 6th attack, around 2pm: ""Mark had been alone in office for quite some time. Rioters getting closer to capitol. Went into office, he was on couch on cellphone. She was frustrated he didn't seem to be doing anything. You should talk to Gym (Jordon)."" Cipollone: barrelling down hallway, rushed into office to talk to Mark. Mark still on his phone. Cipollone: ""The rioters have gotten to the capitol, we need to go see the president. Mark: He doesn't want to do anything, Pat. Cipollone: Something needs to be done, or people are going to die and the blood will be on your hands."" Meadows & Cipollone went to dining room. Gym called back while they were gone. She went to dining room, valet let her in. She showed Mark the phone. She overheard convo about ""hang Mike Pence"" chants. Meadows, Cipollone come back to office. Cipollone: ""We need to do more."" Meadows: ""You heard him, Pat, he thinks Pence deserves it. He doesn't think they're doing anything wrong."" (**Holy F-ing Shit!**)

Trump in ABC news interview, asked about the riot: ""Because it's common sense. If you know a vote is fraudulent, how can you pass on a fraudulent vote to congress?""

2:24 pm: Trump ""Pence did not have the courage"" tweet.

Pottinger, former Deputy National Security advisor: Read the tweet, decided to resign that day.

Many other members of staff resigned as well. Secretary DeVos: ""There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation.""

Secretary Chao: ""This is deeply troubling to me in a way I cannot set aside.""

On Jan 6th, during riot, a group was pushing Trump to take immediate and urgent action. Ivanka, WH counsels office. Another group was neutral. Last group, ""deflect and blame"". ""Blame ANTIFA.""

3pm: Meadows dictated statement to her: ""Anyone who entered the capitol (""illegally"" or ""without authorization"") should leave immediately."" Statement was never issued. Ivanka wanted Trump to ""Tell them to go home peacefully."" Many others asked for similar action. Laura Igraham. Don Jr. McCarthy: ""I completely condemn violence in the capitol. Un-American. Disappointed. Sad."" Gallagher: ""Mr. President, you are the only person who can call this off. The election is over. Call it off."" Hannity.

4:17pm, Trump video: ""We have to have peace...go home...we love you...you're very special....I know how you feel, but go home, and go home in peace.""

Hutchinson: Trump ""reluctant"" to film video.

Cabinet members discussed using 25th to remove Trump from power after attack on capitol.

Advisors and Family wanted President to give speech on Jan. 7th. President resisted speech, and removed lines about ""prosecuting the rioters"" or ""calling them violent"". Trump wanted to all language about pardoning the rioters. He didn't think they did anything wrong. Pence did the wrong thing by not standing with him. Advisors urged him to give the speech. Told him he ""needed it as cover"". Trump in Jan 7th speech, refused to say ""This election is not over.""

Giuliani expressed interest in a pardon. Meadows sought a pardon from Trump.

**tldr**; Trump & team knew about weapons and threats of violence before Jan 6th and took no action. Trump wanted secret service to let people with weapons into security zone for his speech. Trump insisted on going to capitol on Jan 6th, but Meadows and secret service told him it was impossible. Trump tried to grab the wheel of the presidential vehicle and grabbed the driver's arm. Trump refused to do anything about violence and threats to hang Mike Pence. After riot, he said rioters ""did nothing wrong."" Members of the cabinet discussed using the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office after January 6th.

Cheney reported several witnesses were contacted about their testimony from people on Trump's team. Be a team player, be loyal, etc.

Specifically, it appears that these Russians used tactics to specifically help Trump and were used against Clinton. They changed these tactics after the election. More interestingly, the indictment states that ""Some defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with **unwitting individuals** associated with the Trump campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities."" (Emphasis mine) 

In addition, Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein stated that ""There is no allegation (in this indictment) that any American was a knowing participant in this activity."" and that ""there is no allegation that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election."" 

Based on what is now currently available, is it fair to say that there is ""No Collusion!"" as the President claims? Is the Mueller Investigation nearing its end, or changing course? Does this help or hurt the liberal position?

Combining ideas from the Heritage Foundation and the text of Ronald Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address, the Contract detailed the actions the party promised to take if they were elected to a Congressional Majority. Many political scholars have cited the Contract with America as the reason behind not only GOP taking back the United States House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years, and while many of its reforms failed to pass or be implemented, it remained an effective political manifesto for the modern perception of the GOP's goals.

The contract's text included a list of eight proposed reforms, and ten proposed bills. These proposals were all limited to policies that polling showed garnered 60% support of the public, aka: ""60% issues."" The goal was for the Contract to avoid controversial issues like abortion and school prayer.

The 8 Procedural Reforms:

* require all laws that apply to the rest of the country also apply to Congress;
* select a major, independent auditing firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Congress for waste, fraud or abuse;
* cut the number of House committees, and cut committee staff by one-third;
* limit the terms of all committee chairs;
* ban the casting of proxy votes in committee;
* require committee meetings to be open to the public;
* require a three-fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase;
* guarantee an honest accounting of the Federal Budget by implementing zero base-line budgeting.

The 10 Bills:

* The Fiscal Responsibility Act - An amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget unless sanctioned by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress

* The Taking Back Our Streets Act - An anti-crime package including greater emphasis on prison construction and law enforcement funding.

* The Personal Responsibility Act - An act to discourage teen pregnancy by reforming and cutting cash welfare and related programs.

* The American Dream Restoration Act - An act to create a $500-per-child tax credit, add a tax credit for couples who pay more taxes in aggregate if they are married than if they were single.

* The National Security Restoration Act - An act to prevent U.S. troops from serving under United Nations command and to cut U.S. payments for UN peacekeeping operations, and to establish guidelines for the integration of former Warsaw Pact nations into NATO.

* The Common Sense Legal Reform Act - A tort reform bill, designed to institute ""Loser pays"" laws that weakening of product-liability laws to prevent litigation against companies for product failures.

* The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act - A package of small-business incentives including capital-gains cuts and indexation, neutral cost recovery, risk assessment/cost-benefit analysis, etc.

* The Citizen Legislature Act - An amendment to the Constitution that would have imposed 12-year term limits on members of the US Congress (i.e. six terms for Representatives, two terms for Senators).

* Family Reinforcement Act - Tax incentives for adoption, strengthening the powers of parents in their children's education, stronger child pornography laws, and elderly dependent care tax credit.

* Senior Citizens Fairness Act - Raise the Social Security earnings limit, repeal the 1993 tax hikes on Social Security benefits and provide tax incentives for private long-term care insurance.

Another option was given to print the form, sign it, and mail it in. Voters can also request that the ballot be mailed to them. For identification I had to enter my driver's license number and/or social security number. I am not an IT expert so I cannot comment on the security of the system.

I noticed of course that my ballot was not at all secret since it had my name attached to it, and was sent from my personal email address through the gmail servers to the election official.

My thoughts are: if the system is secure, then why can't Americans living in America vote online? If the system is not secure, why can Americans living abroad use it? It seems that my state (among others) offers this service only to residents living outside the country.

Is the possibility for fraud just so low here because of the relatively small numbers of Americans living abroad? (the State Department, crazily in my opinion, doesn't know, but estimates about 9 million)

On the other hand, given that the State Department *doesn't even attempt* to track the numbers of Americans living abroad (to get good information, you have to look to the census departments of the host countries) and that the process seems to easy to do, a bad actor with a list of DL# or SS# (easy enough to get) and addresses could fraudulently submit a lot of ballots and claim the people are living abroad.

There are almost certainly first amendment issues here, in addition to the fact that the FTC and FCC are independent agencies so aren't obligated to follow through either way.

The above said, this rule was written in 1996, when only 16% of the US population used the internet. Those who drafted it likely didn't consider that one day, the companies protected by this exemption would dwarf traditional media companies in both revenues and reach. Today, it empowers these companies to not only distribute misinformation, hate speech, terrorist recruitment videos and the like, it also allows them to generate revenues from said content, thereby disincentivizing their enforcement of community standards.

Based on what I've been reading, I'm strongly starting to suspect that this YouTube film itself was part of a larger incitement plan. I'm not sure to what extent and how it might be connected but there are some startling questions raised.

Here are the key reported facts about the film itself:

* The cast and crew stated that a man going by the alias ""Bacile"" and claiming to be an Israeli Jew told them they were making a historical drama. The director is at the time claimed in [the Craiglist casting post](http://www.mooncasting.com/us/casting-feature-desert-warrior-los-angeles/) to be someone named ""Alan Roberts.""


* The crew and cast stated [the involvement of several middle eastern men in the initial production:](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1255908--does-sam-bacile-really-exist-innocence-of-muslims-director-could-be-coptic-christian-with-a-checkered-past)
>Klein said he didn’t know the real name of the man he called “Sam,” who came to him for advice on First Amendment issues. About 15 key players from the Middle East — people from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan and Iran, and a couple of Coptic Christians from Egypt — worked on the film, Klein said.


* Despite their involvement, the cast is selected to be largely white Americans without any particular formal acting training appearing in brown face make up.


* The actors are given alternate fake scripts that feature scenes that would visually match the inflammatory sequences but carefully packaged to completely conceal the film's content. Every effort is made by the 'producers' to hide, deceive, and trick the cast and crew from the actual intent and plan of what is actually being created. After several scenes are recorded with these actors, [the scenes are manipulated and re-dubbed to recast it into a blatant anti-Islamic caricature mocking the prophet Mohammed](http://gawker.com/5942748). 


* These scenes are cobbled together into a 14 minute YouTube video, but it is unclear at this time if an actual full film really exists or the entire effort was to manufacture the short YouTube clip. [There are now major doubts whether it was ever intended to be an actual film or some kind of larger hoax.](http://theweek.com/article/index/233263/does-the-movie-that-provoked-the-libyan-slayings-even-exist) Further doubts are cast when [claims that it was once screened in Hollywood fail to check out.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/world/middleeast/origins-of-provocative-video-shrouded.html?_r=3&hp&pagewanted=all)
>He said the film had been shown at a screening at a theater “100 yards or so” from Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood over the summer, drawing what he suggested was a depressingly small audience. He declined to specify what theater might have shown it, and theater owners in the vicinity of the busy strip said they had no record of any such showing.


* When news begins to break and reporters attempt to contact someone named ""Bacile,"" [the man via phone impersonating him tells any reporter who will listen that the movie was created at the behest of ""100 Israeli Jews"" who gave him ""5 million dollars.""](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/09/12/161003427/what-we-know-about-sam-bacile-the-man-behind-the-muhammad-movie)  No evidence of any kind supporting this claim has been found.


* The man impersonating Bacile is revealed to be Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, an Egyptian man living in California. He pleaded no contest in 2010 to federal bank fraud charges and served 21 months in federal prison. [He has been operating under several pseudonyms. Federal court papers show Mr Nakoula’s aliases include Nicola Bacily, Erwin Salameh and others.] (http://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/jewish-director-of-prophet-muhammed-film-sam-bacile-may-be-alias-of-egyptian-fraud-convict-8134746.html)


* When confronted by an AP reporter he continues to claim that Bacile is a real person who is a Jewish Israeli and further claims that he himself is a Coptic Christian.
>""Nakoula denied he had posed as Bacile. During a conversation outside his home, he offered his driver's license to show his identity but kept his thumb over his middle name, Basseley. Records checks by the AP subsequently found the name 'Basseley' and other connections to the Bacile persona.


* Two key players in this drama, Terry Jones and Sam Klein say that they were contacted by this man under his alias and asked to distribute and promote this film. Both are known for anti-Muslim rhetoric and Jones himself is known for inciting violence through past incidents. This is what helped create the massive confusion about whether the film was created by Coptics or Terry Jones or whoever. It now appears clear that all of those people were brought in after the creation of the video, spoke only briefly with Bacile, and were told to promote the video at a certain time. [They also appear to have been misled about the identity of the real creators:](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/muhammad-film-consultant-sam-bacile-is-not-israeli-and-not-a-real-name/262290/)
>Klein told me that Bacile, the producer of the film, is not Israeli, and most likely not Jewish, as has been reported, and that the name is, in fact, a pseudonym. He said he did not know “Bacile”‘s real name. He said the man who identified himself as Bacile asked him to help make the anti-Muhammad film. When I asked him to describe Bacile, he said: “**I don’t know that much about him. I met him, I spoke to him for an hour.** He’s not Israeli, no. I can tell you this for sure, the State of Israel is not involved, Terry Jones (the radical Christian Quran-burning pastor) is not involved. **His name is a pseudonym. All these Middle Eastern folks I work with have pseudonyms. I doubt he’s Jewish. I would suspect this is a disinformation campaign.**”

The villa came under an intense and highly accurate mortar barrage.
“I really believe that this attack was planned,” he said. “The accuracy with which the mortars hit us was too good for any regular revolutionaries.”

**UPDATED INFORMATION 5 PM EST:**
 
* [Wired has uncovered information that the listed shell company that managed the film was named ""Pharaoh Voice, Inc""](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/anti-islam-flick/all/) and run by someone named ""Youssef M Basseley"" likely another alias of Nakoula. 
>L.A.-based actress Cindy Garcia, who played a role as the mother in the video, listed a “Sam Bassiel” as the film’s producer on her resume. Crew member Jimmy Israel was given the name “Abnob Nakoula Basseley” for registration with the Screen Actors Guild. A company behind the casting, called Pharaoh Voice, Inc., listed a “Youssef M. Basseley” as its president.  
[Corporate listing here.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Hawaiian-Gardens/pharaoh-voice-inc/44853277.aspx)

* Nakoula nows denies any involvement in the film's creation stating:
>Nakoula told the Associated Press he managed a company that produced the video, but has since denied any involvement in the film. “I’m a gas station worker, I didn’t work on it, I know nothing about it. They need to blame someone,” Nakoula later told the Telegraph during an interview outside his Los Angeles home. But on Thursday, federal law enforcement officials said that Nakoula was in fact Bacile. 

* In July of 2011 — the month after he got out of jail — Nakoula started casting actors for “Innocence.”

* [WIRED article cites](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/anti-islam-flick/all/) several other aliases uncovered being used by Nakoula. Matthew Nekola; Ahmed Hamdy; Amal Nada; Daniel K.

**UPDATED INFORMATION 6 PM EST**

* We now know somewhat of the process on how the video was spread in the key regions. [Both the U.S. promotion by Jones at the request of Bacile and the promoting within the middle east and Egypt specifically appeared to happen at the same time.](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/09/egyptian-outrage-peddler-who-sent-anti-islam-youtube-clip-viral/56826/)
> The original trailer of Innocence of Muslims was posted to YouTube by Bacile in July, but **never gained attention until last week when it was translated into Arabic and linked to by an Egyptian-American Copt Morris Sadek in an Arabic-language blog post. Around that same time, Koran-burning Florida Pastor Terry Jones began promoting the film to practically no effect in the U.S.** But it did gain the attention of a Glenn Beck-style TV pundit in Egypt: Sheikh Khalad Abdalla, a host on the Islamist satellite-TV station al-Nas.* On Sept. 8, Abdullah lit the match that set this entire international incident in motion and broadcast an offensive clip of the trailer in which a man playing Muhammad calls a donkey ""the first Muslim animal."" 
[Here's the fateful moment of Abdullah on TV playing the clip.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnM_NuW0r9M&feature=player_embedded)


* 3 days BEFORE the embassy attack and before the Bacile/Nousak interview with AP in which he claimed to be Coptic, the story that the video was created by ""Coptics"" was already circulating the middle east.
> Shortly following Abdullah's broadcast, views of the video began increasing rapidly and Cairo news outlet Youm7.com reported that the leader of an Egyptian political party ""denounced the production of the film with the participation of vengeful Copts.""

* Bacile/Nakoula's YouTube account appears to have favorited a video from Egyptian Salafist Al Nour Party featuring Al Nour Party spokesman Nader Bakkar:
> Sam Bacile, didn’t do much with his YouTube account, besides uploading two clips from the “Innocence of Muslims” film, but he also commented in Arabic on an Egyptian video discussing his movie, and [last month he had favorited a video from the Egyptian Salafist Al Nour Party featuring Al Nour Party spokesman Nader Bakkar attacking Ibrahim Issa and defending the Salafis](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DjVszAn4GAyzgsjtkJONg/videos?flow=grid&view=15). A video defending Salafism is an odd choice for someone who claims to think Islam is a cancer to add to his favorites.

Country Sheriff's Department on March 27, 1997 and charged with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.** He pleaded guilty and was sentenced on Nov. 3, 1997 to one year in county jail and three years probation. The D.A.’s office said he violated probation on April 8, 2002, and was re-sentenced to another year in county jail.

I believe there's very strong evidence here that a low cost, high concept plan was at work to manufacture this video. The fact that it was used as incitement for an attack that also appears to have been organized has only raised my suspicions further. I do not claim to know who or what purpose was actually behind creating this video, but I'm certain that there are serious questions here that need to be answered.",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud
33,January 6th Hearings discussion thread - Part IV,228.0,vhoj1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/vhoj1g/january_6th_hearings_discussion_thread_part_iv/,349.0,1655848051.0,"Here's a thread to discuss the fourth ""January 6th"" public hearing, which was held Tuesday, June 21st. You can [watch the hearings on C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?521075-1/fourth-hearing-investigation-capitol-attack), as well as plenty of other places.

[Today's hearing](https://www.c-span.org/video/?521075-1/fourth-hearing-investigation-capitol-attack) focused on the actions of Trump and his team when they pressured state officials to change or throw out state-level election results. In his opening statement, Mr. Thompson mentioned the recent case in New Mexico, where a [county commissioner has attempted](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/new-mexico-county-commissioner-who-refuses-to-certify-recent-election-results-sentenced-for-role-in-january-6-attack/ar-AAYAWwp) to throw out election results he disagreed with, as an example of the ongoing threat to democracy from the GOP. Ms. Cheney linked this plan to the other efforts to overthrow the election related to January 6th, and re-iterated that Trump was told by several campaign and administration officials that there was no basis for the claims of election fraud. Mr. Schiff continued by connecting the events they'll discuss in this hearing to the rest of the January 6th plot. Schiff described the pressure campaign, which continued for weeks, even after Trump was told by AG Barr and others than the claims of fraud were ""b\*llsh\*t"", and how Republicans targeted election officials and even election workers with doxxing and threats of violence. They showed video of Nick Fuentes implying that his supporters should kill state legislators. The four witnesses gave testimony about how this campaign worked from their point of view. Rusty Bowers, GOP speaker of the Arizona state house and Brad Raffensperger, GOP Secretary of State of Georgia, and Gabriel Sterling, COO of the state of Georgia, and Wandrea Shamoss, a former elections worker in Fulton County, GA.

Speaker Bowers testified about [Trump's statement of today](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-threatens-rusty-bowers-audio-tape-he-said-election-was-rigged-arizona-1717778) saying that Bowers told Trump in November 2020 that the election was rigged and Trump won AZ. Bowers testified that both of those statements are false. He spoke to Giuliani and Trump multiple times after the election. Bowers asked Giuliani for proof of the fraud in the form of names of illegal and dead voters, which Giuliani promised to give during the call, but never provided to Bowers. Trump asked Bowers to hold a committee meeting at the AZ capitol to review the evidence. Bowers referred to it as a ""circus"", and refused. Trump wanted the committee to remove Biden's electors and replace them with Trump electors. Bowers told Trump that this would be in violation of his oath of office. He described a fake AZ ""legislative hearing"" held by Giuliani and others in Phoenix. He said the fake hearing did not follow protocols, and was not a real legislative hearing. Jenna Ellis also told Bowers that she had the supposed list of illegal and dead voters, and would give it to him, but never did. No one ever provided evidence of significant election fraud to Bowers. They showed footage of armed protestors illegally entering and refusing to leave the AZ state house, including Jacob Chansley, the Q-anon shaman, as well as proud boys. They called for Bowers by name. Bowers testified that he supported and voted for Trump in 2020. Later, Eastman called Bowers in December and asked for the legislature to take a vote to decertify the GA electors. Eastman: ""Just do it and let the courts sort it out."" Bowers refused. Bowers testified that he ""would not do anything illegal for him"" twice. He got a call from US Rep. Biggs of AZ on the AM of Jan 6th. Biggs asked him to sign a letter and support the decertification of the electors. Bowers refused.

November 18th, Trump campaign lawyer Kenneth CheseBro wrote a memo describing a scheme to send slates of fake electors. Giuliani, Meadows, Eastman, several members of congress, and the RNC were involved in setting up this scheme. After the election fraud cases failed in court, several lawyers associated with the scheme became uncomfortable and refused to participate further. The white house counsels office said that this scheme was ""not legally sound."" Robert Sinners, Trump campaign staffer, described himself and others who helped with the scheme as ""Useful idiots"" or ""rubes"", and that ""no one really cared"" if they were ""putting themselves in jeopardy."" They were told that the fake electors would ""only be used"" if the campaign won in court. The schemers told the fake electors to meet in secret. Fake electors in 7 states met in December 14 2020, and signed documents falsely asserting that they were ""duly elected"" electors, and submitted them to the National Archives and VP Pence. Eastman said that the fact of the multiple slates of electors demonstrated the uncertainty of either. Pence did not consider these votes lawfully submitted, and did not consider them when he certified the results after the attack on the capitol.

Bowers testified that Trump supporters harassed and threatened his office with thousands of texts, voicemails, and emails. Trump supporters protested Bowers home, called Bowers a pedophile and pervert, and threatened him and his neighbors.

Trump on Jan 6, after Barr told him that these claims were false: ""They should find those votes. ....just over 11,000 votes, that's all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia."" Raffensperger: supported Trump in 2020. Election day went remarkably smooth in GA. Biden won by approximately 12,000 votes. Did an audit and hand recount of all 5 million ballot, came remarkably close to the first count. Trump asked for another recount, same results. Even after losing in court, Trump & co. continued to make many allegations of voter fraud. Spokesperson/COO Sterling Dec 1 press conference, asked Trump ""...Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed."" Why?: Dominion voting systems project manager told him their contractor was being threatened by Q-Anon. Tweet, directed at contractor: ""You've committed treason, may God have mercy on your soul"" with a noose gif. Trump tweeted response: ""Massive voter fraud in GA."" (False). Dec 2 Trump video: ""...thousands and thousands of votes that were out of whack..."". Giuliani launched conspiracy theory: election workers kicked out poll observers, [suitcases of ballots](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/video-doesnt-show-suitcases-of-illegal-ballots-in-georgia/) in Fulton County. This was false, and promoted by Trump and Giuliani. Sterling's office reviewed 48 hours of video, showed normal ballot processing. ""Suitcases"" were sealed ballot carriers. Workers were started to quit for the night, Raffensperger asked supervisor to keep on counting, so they stored the ballots, then re-opened the boxes. Hand tally: 0.1053% off of total votes, 0.0099% off of margin, ""basically dead-on accurate"". Sterling gave frequent press briefings to address disinformation. Trump team continued to promote conspiracy theories even after they were disproved. Trump supporter, after Sterling personally disproved the allegations of fraud to him: ""I just know in my heart they cheated.""

US Atty Pack looked into the allegations for AG Barr, and told Barr that ""Giuliani was wrong"". Barr said ""Fulton county allegations had no merit."" Dep. AG Donahue told Trump directly that allegations ""had been thoroughly investigated and were without merit.""

Trump to GA investigator Watson, Chief investigator, a state law enforcement official, Dec 24th: ""I won by hundreds of thousands of votes."" ""When the right answer comes out, you'll be praised."" ""Whatever you can do."" Meadows wanted to send Watson's office ""A shitload of POTUS stuff. Signed hats."" wtf? :/

Jan 2nd, phone call from Trump to Raffensperger. ""Nothing wrong with saying that you've recalculated."" The numbers are the numbers. He checked each of the allegations, 300 investigations and none of them turned up significant results that could come close to changing the results. FBI and GBI also looked into allegations, found nothing. Trump: ""They're either dishonest or incompetent."" Trump retweeted ""...\[Governor Kemp\] and \[Raffensperger\] ... going to jail."" Trump: ""Ballots are corrupt. \[...\] You know what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a criminal offense..."" ... ""...I just wanna find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state."" Trump: ""...criminality...that's very dangerous."" Raffesperger: I thought this was a threat. Cellphone & wife's were doxxed. His wife received sexualized attacks over text. People broke into daughter-in-law's home. Raffensperger: ""We followed the law and we followed the Constitution.""

Trump: ""Why wouldn't you want to find the right answers...we just want the truth. Everyone's gonna look very good when the truth comes out. I won by 400,000 votes. I only need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.""

Wandrea Shaye Moss and her mother, targeted by Trump & the GOP. Election worker for over 10 years. She looked frightened. Talked about how she loved her job. She & her mother were on the ""suitcase plot"" videos promoted by Trump & Co. Giuliani on video, accused Wandrea and her mother by name of: ""...passing around USB ports as if they're vials of heroin or cocaine."" (Me: Talk about racist dog whistles...). Received facebook threats. Death. Jail with her mother. Be glad its not 1920. Racist comments. Trump repeated the false allegations in call to Raffensperger, named Ruby Freeman (Moss's mother) a ""professional vote scammer and hustler"". Trump attacked them 18 times on the call. Ruby Moss is afraid to give her name in public now. Wandrea is afraid to go anywhere. FBI told Ruby that she had to leave her house for her safety for two months around/after January 6th. Prompted by January 6th, she had gotten many threats. Trump supporters showed up at Wandrea's grandmother's house. Pushed their way in ""to make a citizens arrest"" looking for Wandrea and Rose. Some people made fake pizza deliveries. None of the election workers shown in the ""suitcase"" video are still working there, including Wandrea and her mother. Other election workers around the country have been subjected to lies and threats. Rose: ""Do you know how it feels to have the President of the United States target you?""

Note: Most of my quotes are ""best effort"" and probably not 100% accurate.

Once again, super long. I'm a bit tired and don't feel like editing it down further, so **tldr**: Trump & company pressured state election officials to overturn their states' results in 2020. Trump & his allies lied and made up conspiracy theories to promote the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Based on these lies, Trump supporters harassed and threatened election officials and volunteers. Trump & Co promoted and supported these lies after they had been disproved. When state election officials did not comply with the scheme to overturn the election, the Trump campaign created fake slates of electors, and submitted fake votes to the National Archives and congress/VP Pence. VP Pence did not consider these votes legitimate and ignored them. 

\- Is it reasonable that someone in Trump's position would still believe the allegations of fraud, despite being told my so many people that they were false?

\- Will the GOP attempt to spoil or overturn election results in 2022 and 2024? Will they succeed?

\- What are your plans for living in a post-democracy America?

\- Do you think incidents such as what happen to Ms. Moss and her mother will discourage Americans from being election workers?",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

36,"'The eyes and mannerism of a Madman:' In an interview published in the Atlantic last week, senior Trump administration officials including William Barr accused their former boss of madness and 'bullshit'. What does this harsh appraisal of the Republican Party leader mean and will it change anything?",198.0,od10e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/od10e1/the_eyes_and_mannerism_of_a_madman_in_an/,219.0,1625328755.0,"""We realized from the beginning it was just bullshit,"" says William Barr of his boss' ""rigged election"" claims.

After Barr publicly announced there was no evidence to back up then-President Trump's fraud claims, he was summoned to the White House for a verbal lashing. One senior official present described the Republican President as having “the eyes and mannerism of a madman.”

>“Did you say that?” Trump asked Barr.

>  
>“How the fuck could you do this to me? Why did you say it?”  
>  
>“Because it’s true.”  
>  
>The president, livid, responded by referring to himself in the third person: “You must hate Trump. You must hate Trump.”

What does it mean for the Republican President's closest advisors and top lieutenants to now be leveling such enormous accusations against their former boss? What does it mean that they are openly challenging Trump's own mental fitness with such harsh rhetoric?

How do we interpret this shift in rhetoric within the Republican Party? Democrats have long accused Trump of being mentally unfit, but seeing this come from top Republicans is unusual I think.

How will these attacks affect the Republican Party's chances in 2022-24, and Trump's chances if he decides to run for president again?

Why is Barr turning on Trump now after years of absolute loyalty? As I recall, Barr was always extremely supportive of the President and regularly praised him in public. Why is he suddenly turning against him like this?

The act of ballot harvesting isn't illegal in many (maybe most) of these states. In Georgia (where it IS illegal) the same folks who put this movie together claim to have evidence of an organized plot by either a person or persons to ballot harvest for $10 per ballot. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has stated, those ballots aren't themselves illegal and would still count because they would have had to be obtained by showing an ID and would go through signature verification.

Imagine the following scenario: You purchase — or yet worse: Undertake a loan — for a vehicle with a balance on its original manufacturer warranty on the premise the it had no issues other than anything minor. So far so good.

After the purchase, problems ensue, the vehicle needs substantial repairs, engine, airbag etc. and potentially some minor problems as well, and the vehicle ends being a regular at the shop for moths spending several weeks there while you keep jumping in and out of similar loaners. Then you learn the vehicle actually were returned for the same major problems only for the manufacturer to buy your car back and sell it without disclosing it knew.

Turns out you could have been spared by a big sticker on your car “lemon law buyback”, but absent federal regulations, manufacturers simply pass these cars between their subsidiaries across states and evade these duties and spare themselves from the loss associated with putting the scary decals on customers cars.

The implications may be dire. When selling the vehicle, you are required by law to disclose issues actually known to you and of material importance. Arguably, knowing your vehicle is an undisclosed lemon law buyback or a “laundered lemon” may substantially affect your selling propositions concealment may result in a finding of criminal fraud.

Absent federal laws banning these practices, one may only relay common law causes of action to sue back, for e.g. if an action or conduct of one is “outrageous”. The trier of fact is typically the people of this questions as it, by definition, is based not on statutory law, but the lack thereof and on our shared conscience and reasonable moral judgements.

Therefore, my questions are:

Would you consider such a sale to you outrageous? If not, why?

I really recommend seeing the videos because they give a sense of the scale involved.

When I lived in Tucson AZ we had a couple of these happen nearby and at the edge of town, but on a far smaller scale - 50 units here, 25 there, I think the biggest was about 75 roughly 50mi north of town near Pacheco.  These were housing developments that didn't get buyers before the bubble burst in 2007; the developers continue to own them with nobody to sell them to, so they decided to sit on them until the market improves.

China has this going on at a scale...well...fuuuuck.

SECOND ISSUE:

One thing that can't be kept secret is that a series of industrial bonds were put out by companies that are now in deep trouble.  Most of them were mining companies, including a lot of coal mines that are now tanking because everybody knows China has to get off coal ASAP (see also Beijing pollution!).  These bonds are starting to come due now but the bulk will hit in May and June and if they start collapsing like a series of dominoes we could easily get a chain-reaction crash extending to the entire world banking system.  Interest rates have been too low for too long, there's a lot of bad debt out there, it could all blow the hell up.

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-02-08/how-dangerous-china%E2%80%99s-credit-bubble-world

The exact date each bond comes due is well known and many big ones hit in the early summer months.  As each bond comes due the companies can either pay them off (unlikely) or get a fresh loan to cover the first.  Economies collapse when the latter can't happen because the ""understood value"" of the property that backs the loan drops.  

That's what happened in the US housing market: newer buyers with bad credit bought houses with loans that had a ""balloon payment"" at 2 or 3 years in.  The plan was, they bought a house for $200k or whatever, it was supposed to gain another 10% or more in value (hence more equity), they would make the payments for those two or three years and refinance based on the new equity level and escape the balloon payment.  Or sell it at a profit, that worked too.  But when the value plunged to $120k in 2007/2008 they were completely fucked.

That same process is about to hit the Chinese economy, except the most spectacular loan failures are going to be from large companies with loan amounts in the billions of dollars.  That will tighten credit generally as everybody gets scared, the home and commercial real estate markets collapse and boom...big trouble.

**The bottom line is, the Chinese banking and finance system is a capitalist system designed and run by evil communists (see also Tiananmen Square) who wouldn't know what a ""public records request"" was if you crammed it under a starving prisoner's fingernails.**

The last Great Depression in the US was triggered by a bank collapse in Austria.  The next is likely to be Chinese.  A bunch of bonds come due this summer.  If the banking system is going to spasm again any time soon, this could be the coming trigger.",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

Biden currently has a lead of ~14,000 votes, but Georgia does not have a trigger for an automatic recount. Instead, the Secretary of State has ordered a manual recount of all votes in order to verify the results and ""build confidence"" in those results.

It should be noted recounts rarely change the results of an election -- to my knowledge, the largest swing in votes ever seen by a statewide recount was 1200 votes during the Bush v Gore recount. For this reason, it is not expected that Biden's victory will be reversed unless there was some egregiously large error or fraud happening.

&#x200B;

Netanyahu made this promise as part of a deal where the far-right parts of the coalition he hopes to cement would, in return, pass legislation blocking any prosecution against him pertaining to existing fraud and bribery charges. He has also not made clear whether annexation would only include parts of the West Bank that see predominately Israeli settlers, or if it would include the entire region.

&#x200B;

Israeli citizens are moving farther right politically and losing faith in most forms of peace ([Source \[3\]](https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-04-08/politics-israel-move-right)), as such there is immense pressure on Netanyahu to follow through.

What about when the conspiracy is true?  In addition, the people who need to be convinced of this are the most naturally opposed to believing it, how do we win this fight, educate the people, and save America? 

For the record, here is my idea:  
  
The idea that the (primarily old-money) super-rich politically influential members of society and the corporations they control are working together to disadvantage the poor and minorities, eliminate social mobility, and cement their position as the ruling elite.  They accomplish this through social conditioning, manipulation of the media, and government legislation.  
  
“There is...an artificial aristocracy founded on wealth and birth, without either virtue or talents.... The artificial aristocracy is a mischievous ingredient in government, and provisions should be made to prevent its ascendancy.” --Thomas Jefferson  
  
Those with wealth and power will always seek to protect their wealth and power.  They are threatened by you and me.  They fear our creative potential.  *They fear our ability to become rich and powerful and dilute their influence.*  They are working to move society to one solidly divided between the rich ruling class and the oppressed poor.  People can be motherfuckers sometimes.  It is *not* unreasonable to believe that those with wealth and power might in fact be motherfuckers working for their own benefit giving no fucks about anyone else.  They want to encourage everyone to be""part of the system"" because they control the system.  They want you to grow up to be unquestioning of authority, spoon fed biased information, and not hold your elected leaders accountable for their actions.  

The less educated, informed, and questioning you are the less responsible they have to be.  The millions spent on campaigns to feed the masses biased information, and the relationship between campaign funding and electoral success show how powerful manipulation of the media really is.  The rich own the media.  They can't own the internet.  Surprised about SOPA and ACTA yet?

Social conditioning goes much farther than that.  Our society has been molded into one of conformity.  ""Go to school get good grades, get a good job.""  ""Don't speak out against authority.""  Students who go against the standard path are beaten into conformity by the system.  Free thinking is discouraged, doing exactly what you're told, exactly how you're told is encouraged.  People are trying to promote the idea that it is ""Un-American"" to pursue socially progressive policy, even though that's what brought America into the international spotlight as a successful world leading nation.  We are taught that we should not question our government or its employees when they abuse their power.  We are being molded into the perfect working class to support the ruling elite.
  
By abolishing minimum wage, wages will be forced down trapping the poor in poverty. These poor people won't be able to afford private schools or health care, putting them at further disadvantage. Privatization of services society relies on will only benefit the rich and hurt the poor. Robert La Follette said ""when transportation becomes vital to society it becomes a function of government."" I would argue that health care and schooling are equally vital.  
  
Now that the poor are trapped and will always remain poor, they are the permanent ""working class."" How can the rich make more money? With more labor! Let's [get rid of contraceptives](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/213325-sen-schumer-blunt-amendment-amounts-to-contraception-ban) and [porn](http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-03-16/news/31202806_1_romney-and-santorum-andrea-saul-santorum-points) so they breed more.

CEOs are racing for the highest margins and biggest bonuses instead of focusing on worker productivity and fair profit sharing.  I think it's safe to say they don't care about the working class.
  
Legislation almost never fails to benefit those with the best funded lobbying groups and biggest campaign donations, regardless of its actual benefit to society. Our politicians are [so desperate for corporate funding](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/take-the-money-and-run-for-office) it leaves them at the mercy of their contributors.  These contributors are, of course, the rich who have an agenda to push.  Major corporations have found out [it's cheaper to legislate away new competition than compete.](http://www.alternet.org/economy/154962/Corruption_Is_Responsible_for_80%25_of_Your_Cell_Phone_Bill/?page=2) (alcohol, tobacco, and pharma vs marijuana for another example).  Profits are not shared fairly with those who contribute most to the company's output and is instead concentrated at the top.  The idea that being good to ""the shareholders"" is more important than being good to your workers is reprehensible and serves to demonstrate the social conditioning that protecting individuals and corporations is more important than benefiting the foundation of American society and productivity.  They want you to care more about them than each other.
  
The TSA is a ballooning waste of money, and most of our defense ""improvements"" are really just [pushing us towards a police state.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/18/tsa-mission-creep-us-police-state) Law now [prohibits protesting where secret service members are present.](http://reason.com/blog/2012/03/01/bill-passes-house-protests-near-secret-s) So much for the right to peaceably assemble, we can kill that just by putting a secret service member near anything of ""importance."" Our rights and freedoms are eroding as we allow the government more and more ability to intrude on our lives and detain citizens based on opinion. Liberty dies to thundering applause as the champions of ""safety"" take over our lives.  
  
Do you think we would have so much war if we didn't allow private companies to lobby for increased military spending and continued war?  
  
The government LIES to us. All the time. [[citation unnecessary]](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=government+lies) They give us enough lip service to stop people from digging deeper and realizing what is going on. They refuse to acknowledge their own fallibility. They refuse to be accountable to the citizens. [Party loyalty](http://www.whchronicle.com/2010/02/in-congress-party-loyalty-trumps-conscience/) and [corporate election budgets](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/take-the-money-and-run-for-office) have ruined our government leaders.  If our leaders are unwilling to accept responsibility and don't get voted out of office this shows how easy it is for the ruling class to walk all over ordinary citizens.
  
As someone who cares about America, and the welfare of all its citizens, I think it is my duty to push for an end to this corruption, and to push towards greater education and higher incomes for everybody, as this is historically proven to push America to its greatest heights. Allowing those who are rich and powerful to become richer and more powerful is not in the interest of all. It is in the interest of those who are rich and powerful. If we do not question authority and challenge its motives we leave ourselves open to manipulation. I do not ask others to blindly agree with what I have to say, I ask them to listen rationally to my argument and consider its merit.  
  
I shall close my argument with quotes from an inspiring patriot:  
  
“If once the people become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress and Assemblies, Judges and Governors, shall all become wolves. *It seems to be the law of our general nature, in spite of individual exceptions.*”  
  
“A society that will trade a little liberty for a little order will lose both, and deserve neither”  
  
“Leave no authority existing not responsible to the people.”
--Thomas Jefferson

My informal summary:

The [first hearing](https://www.c-span.org/video/?520282-1/open-testimony-january-6-committee) established that members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers believed that Trump called on them to help overturn the results of the election of 2020, and planned some aspects of the attack on the capitol in advance. It also reviewed the timeline of events, focused on alleged inaction on the part of Trump and his team to stop the attack, and included testimony from various Proud Boys, administration and campaign officials, a capital police officer, and a documentary film director.

[Today's hearing](https://www.c-span.org/video/?520804-1/hearing-investigation-capitol-attack) is focused on the allegations of election fraud from Trump's team. It showed that Trump began claiming election fraud well before the election itself. It included testimony from multiple campaign and administration officials, who told Trump and his team that the allegations of fraud were baseless. It summarized the findings of the DOJ, election integrity officials, the intelligence community, local election officials, and court cases, all of which showed that there was no substantial fraud. It also included testimony from GOP election lawyers and experts, and reviewed some of the debunked allegations of fraud in more detail. They reviewed the outcome of the 60+ court cases, all of which failed to find fraud or change election results. The included statements from the judges ruling in those cases indicating that not only were the allegations wrong, many of them were absurd. They pointed out that Guliani's license to practice law has been suspended because of his actions in these cases. They linked the lies Trump told about election fraud to fundraising efforts post-election. It closed with more video of Trump supporters on January 6th saying they were there because they thought the election was stolen, many of them repeating lies that Trump and his team told about election fraud.

What do you think?

\- Is the committee credible? Did they tell any falsehoods, or fail to provide relevant evidence?

\- Was the hearing persuasive? Will it change any minds?

\- Will there be any changes to election laws or other changes based on these hearings?

\- Will they impact the 2022 or 2024 elections?

From the opening:

>This case is about a doctor who killed babies and endangered women. What we mean is that he regularly and illegally delivered live, viable, babies in the third trimester of pregnancy – and then murdered these newborns by severing their spinal cords with scissors. The medical practice by which he carried out this business was a filthy fraud in which he overdosed his patients with dangerous drugs, spread venereal disease among them with infected instruments, perforated their wombs and bowels – and, on at least two occasions, caused their deaths. Over the years, many people came to know that something was going on here. But no one put a stop to it. 
> Let us say right up front that we realize this case will be used by those on both sides of the abortion debate. We ourselves cover a spectrum of personal beliefs about the morality of abortion. For us as a criminal grand jury, however, the case is not about that controversy; it is about disregard of the law and disdain for the lives and health of mothers and infants. We find common ground in exposing what happened here, and in recommending measures to prevent anything like this from ever happening again.

I would think that this is something that both pro-choice and pro-lief people could agree on, especially since Gosnell was accused of forcing a girl to have an abortion against her will.

75,Can we end this class warfare and redefine the problem as warfare against abuse of the system?,42.0,1dj30m,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1dj30m/can_we_end_this_class_warfare_and_redefine_the/,85.0,1367465561.0,"I've been super perplexed lately, how workers rights, rights to a social safety net, and the right to a fair wage for hours worked have become a ""lefty-liberal"" issue that is met with incredible backlash from the very people that sound policy in these areas would benefit: The hard working right wing middle class. 

And then it hit me.

Both sides of the middle-class political spectrum are looking at this all wrong.

After reading the comments on [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/1dhq56/bankers_explain_how_they_cannot_possibly_live_on/), I was struck by how much resentment there is toward the wealthy in general by the hivemind. And by extension, many left leaning people. 

And I don't have a particular post to show, but I think that we can all agree that the biggest argument against social safety nets are based on the ""Welfare Queens"" and other people that take advantage.

I think people who argue for workers rights and social safety nets have been portrayed as people who want ""Free Hand Outs"" and want to protect their right to slack. And they are portrayed as people who want to kill many peoples perception of The American Dream: Aspirations of Wealth. 

When in reality, it's just the opposite. We are working for economic mobility, that is the American Dream. And maybe our perception is that the wealthy are fighting to keep us from that. 

Sure, some wealthy are, but we shouldn't focus on how much money they have, we should focus on the behaviors: Lobbying, Fraud, Loopholes, Legalized Thievery, Greed.

I've known a few people who straight up lived on the dole without working when they could: This was the vast minority of the poor in my experience.

I've known (and have been) the very poor, who've used those social safety nets very temporarily as a banister to get our footing into upward mobility: This was the vast majority of the poor in my experience.

I've known the pretty darn wealthy, who utilize those tax breaks but who haven't done anything dirty (that I know of) to attain their wealth: The vast majority in my experience. 

And I've known the pretty darn wealthy who've earned their place in hell with what they've done to attain and retain their wealth: Vast minority- but a minority that packs a much larger punch than the poor minority living on the dole...

TLDR; Not all wealthy are greedy scum, not all poor are lazy. In fact, these are the minority. We have to redefine these issues in a way that isn't class warfare and doesn't polarize people who should be working toward the same goals.

Conservatives have painted this and student activism as a means to mock the left for acting in contradiction to ""liberal values"" of tolerance and compassion. Whilst the student protests represent a fringe of fringes on the left, and indeed I've heard many a progressive who are not particularly fond of either student activists or BLM and other identity politics groups, they are such an inviting target for the right to mock the other side since in their view, they are acting as self-righteous and hypocritical as the very conservatives they claim to hate.

On the flip side, we have the recent shooting of the PP clinic in Colorado Springs which due to the nature of the target plus other incidents by anti-abortion activists has had the left come out to ridicule and lambast conservatives and pro-life supporters for indirectly supporting such incidents even if the majority condemn using violence to outlaw abortion. They also tend to point out how acts of domestic political violence in America such as Oklahoma City or Dylann Roof are often associated with the far right to imply that the left is inherently more just and virtuous by saying ""You can complain all you want about BLM or Missouri, but our side isn't the one shooting at people who disagree with us, *yours* is"". 

And these are just but two examples, conservatives mock Hillary supporters for supporting the same Wall Street insider and supporter of big business that liberals associate with the GOP or Sanders supporters for being extremely naive and ignorant of what goes on beyond their social media bubble whilst purporting Sanders as the literal Second Coming. Meanwhile the left goes after conservatives over the fact nearly half of their side would vote for someone whose campaign had been associated with fascism (Trump), someone who took part in pharmaceutical fraud (Carson), and someone whose rhetoric on social issues seem to be just a few words removed from sounding like ISIS propaganda (Cruz).

Former President Donald Trump has also latched on to the audit, claiming that the audit has already found evidence of an 'unbelievable election crime'. Trump's claims prompted a response from the current AZ Secretary of State refuting his claims.

In general, how should people respond to the emergence of a military dictatorship?",33.0,lvrhoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/lvrhoc/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_civil_disobedience/,7.0,1614651305.0,"A few weeks ago, there was a coup in Myanmar. The military disbanded the democratic government, claiming that there was election fraud. Since then, the country has been controlled by a military junta. 

In response, a large protest movement emerged. For weeks, crowds of people have taken to the streets to protest military rule. The movement has been referred to as a civil disobedience movement, and protest leaders have stressed that the movement is non-violent. 

As time has gone one, the military has responded to this protest movement in an increasingly violent manner. Recently, they have begun firing their rifles into the crowds, killing protestors. 

What are your thoughts on the effectiveness of the civil disobedience movement? Is nonviolent civil disobedience an effective strategy in dictatorships? Or, does this type of strategy only work in democracies? Are dictatorships susceptible to pressure from this type of protest? Is it reasonable to hope that a dictatorship will concede in the face of sufficient resentment by the people living under them? 

Additionally, many of the protestors hold signs pleading their case in English. The intention of these signs is arguably to implore democratic countries to intervene, perhaps militarily. If this is the goal, then perhaps it makes sense that nonviolent civil disobedience is the best strategy to evoke sympathy from democratic countries? But, how likely is foreign intervention? Is that a reasonable thing to hope for? 

Myanmar is arguably within China's sphere of influence, and China seems to tacitly support the military junta. Does this change the calculus? Should people abandon hope of foreign intervention, considering that China may fight such attempts to intervene? 

Alternatively, is it reasonable for people to hope that they may be able to sway public opinion in China by consistently protesting in a peaceful way? In Chinese media, Hong Kong protestors were sometimes villainized for engaging in occasional violence. By protesting peacefully, do people in Myanmar make it more difficult for Chinese media to villainize them, and thus increase the likelihood that China may intercede on their behalf? After all, China had a civil relationship with democratic government. Also, they had a sometimes-uneasy alliance with the military junta that ruled previously. They maintained a decent relationship, but the junta was not friendly to communism generally. 

Finally, when does violent resistance by the people become the appropriate response to a dictatorship? So far, Myanmar protest leaders have insisted on maintaining a nonviolent protest movement. But, is that possibly something that should be reconsidered? 

All that said, are there any other strategies that people should employ in the face of a military dictatorship? What is the best response to a situation like this? What should the people of Myanmar do?",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

Althought I’m clearly not imparcial. 

In late 2015 the MUD (a collition of opposition parties) won most of the AN( Asamblea Nacional or National Assembly). The AN is our legislative power. The government used the tools at their disposal, like accusing of corruption to some deputys to won a little more seats but at the end the MUD won 167 and the government parties won 55. 

The TSJ ( Tribunal Supremo de Justicia or Supreme Tribunal of Justice), our highest court of law declared the AN in “rebellion” and unconstitutional, for different things they wanted to do and that was constitutional to do but they did not wanted. The TSJ is elected by the AN. When the TSJ was elected it was when the AN was not ruled by a opposition majority. The AN (who is now in “rebellion” according to the government) after being stripped of power during the constitutional crisis and the call for a rewriting of the constitution by the government, opposition-led National Assembly of Venezuela creates a Judicial Nominations Committee on 13 June 2017 to elect new members of the TSJ, many of the members are pursue by this so they have to leave the country and try to simbolically rule in the exile, this is what is called “TSJ en el exilio” or “Supreme Tribunal of Justice in exile”. So now we have an AN with an opposition majority and a TSJ with opposition majority that cannot do much. For the other side the government has to their side the TSJ but not an AN, so the TSJ attributed themselves the AN functions and duties, postponed the presidential elections and call to elections to create the ANC, an institution who will have more power than any other Public Powers and institutions and who should create a new constitution.

 The opposition did not want to participate since they said that all that led to this was not according to law. Elections were still made and all the seats where won by government parties. They had the highest number of votes they ever had in an election. For comparison, they had 5.352.142 in 2016 in the AN elections and in the ANC elections they had 8 millions. When Maduro won the elections in 2013 he had 7.505.338. This raised many suspecions since the crisis never stopped to imcrease and for 2017 it was much worse, so having more votes than ever should not make much sense. The doubts of a fair elections in the ANC elections in 2017 were even higher when Smartmatic the company who owns the machines for electrical vote in that election released an statement saying that they think there were manipulation of votes [Link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1AI1KZ)  . There where no international observers. For the opposition this was the last proof needed to show that this was a regime who did not care about the law. Since that time opposition was separared in two, the ones who did not want to vote again since there where many proofs of electoral fraud and the ones that keep wanting to go future elections with a known disadvantage (government has all the news channels and used public resources to do politics campaign, etc). For the presidential elections the most important parties refused to go and the two most important candidates were Nicolas Maduro and Henry Falcon. Henry Falcon is an interesting figure since he was a known Chavista (supporter of Chavez) before, then he claimed himself as opposition. If you ask to someone, most people would say that he still plays to the government side. 

Maduro won the elections and opposition keep divided with one side blaming the other of collaborating with the regime and  anyone on this side with any hope at all of any change. Is now 2019 an the AN changes of President since every year a different President assumes. The AN with Juan Guaido at his charges makes a bold move, one that was demanded by many people for some time, and call the article 350 of the constitution, which basically says that the people of Venezuela will no recognize any regime that do not follow the law and incurs in violations of human rights. For that reason the 10th of January is the end of Nicolas Maduro presidency, since the AN does not recognize the re-election made the last year. Now there is a power vacuum and the AN calls the article 233 of the constitution, saying that Nicolas Maduro abandoned his position. Maduro does not care and he takes the presidency in front of the TSJ (althought this should have been done in front of the AN, but as said before, for them the TSJ have the functions of the AN now).  As for the AN, the constitution declares that when in a vacuum of a power the president of the AN should be the Interin President and call to elections in 30 days. 

So now Juan Guaido is the interin president of Venezuela but Maduro says he is not. Guaido is backed up by countries like Canada, USA, Chile, Perú, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Israel, Australia, France, etc. Recognizing a president means that his government is on control of any foreign matter, included economics one like state-owned companies in those countries. This confusing battle between both sides and all the legal aspects behind it has made many news to do not provide good information about this. 

Edit: There was a try to do a recall election in 2016, the CNE ( the Electoral Power) said there were logistic problems so the process had to be done in 2017. For a recall election to be done it is needed that 20% of the electoral populations firms a petition. The firms where delivered but the CNE said that there was evidence of fraud on 20.000 signatures so they denied this process, they later said that this could not be repeated althought they constitution demands it. When later in 2017 Maduros asked for the ANC to be created the elections were done in just 30 days while it took over one year to the referendum process tried to be started. This raised more distrust on the electoral system. ",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

Since the end of January, there have been multiple reports of inappropriate campaigning tactics from the Sanders Team that are starting to really concern me. This is not intended as an attack on Bernie Sanders' personal character. I am interested in hearing what you guys think of these incidents. I'll have some questions at the end.

The first incident came in late January when the American Legion had to send multiple cease-and-desist letters to the Sanders Campaign about misusing their logo in campaign materials. From the American Legion letter as [quoted on Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bernie-sanders-american-legion-logo-218945?lo=ap_a2): 
&gt;""A flier urges people to support your candidacy and contains pictures of the emblem of The American Legion while referencing the Veterans of Foreign Wars. This is totally illegal and misleading.”

Then in the beginning of February, a similar incident occurred in which Sanders mailers containing the logos of AARP and the League of Conservation voters were sent out in Iowa and Nevada (http://www.newsweek.com/sanders-complaints-iowa-nevada-420806). AARP does not endorse any candidates in any elections and never has. The League of Conservation Voters had endorsed Clinton already and only authorizes endorsed candidates to use their trademarks. The statement from AARP:
&gt;“While we have encouraged the presidential candidates to lay out their plans to update Social Security, AARP did not authorize the Sanders campaign to mention AARP or use the AARP logo, and we did not participate in its production,”

This continued again with ads in both Vermont and Iowa titled ""Endorsed"" that either implied or claimed endorsements that Sanders  not receive. [This article from Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/04/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-ad-claims-endorsements-valley-news-/) and [this NY times one](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/29/bernie-sanders-trumpets-iowa-papers-praise-unsaid-it-endorsed-hillary-clinton/) both reported on the ads. Of the three newspapers in the ads (the Nashua Tribune, the Valley News, and the Des Moines Register), not one had endorsed Sanders. The Des Moines Register quote was even pulled from their editorial endorsing Clinton.

Sanders staffers have been caught impersonating Culinary Union members in Nevada in order to gain access to employee dining rooms. The Culinary Union's [statement on the matter](https://www.ralstonreports.com/blog/sanders-workers-are-masquerading-culinary-members-campaign-inside-hotels):
&gt;We can confirm multiple reports of Bernie Sanders’ campaign staffers attempting and gaining access to Employee Dining Rooms at Las Vegas Strip properties where over 57,000 members that we represent work. We are disappointed and offended. It's completely inappropriate for any campaign to attempt to mislead Culinary Union members, especially at their place of work.

Lastly, two of Sanders' New Hampshire campaign staffers have been investigated after being caught on camera admitting to voting in New Hampshire despite being residents of other states. [From the New Hampshire Union Leader](http://www.unionleader.com/Sanders-pairs-domicile-claims-for-registering-to-vote-under-scrutiny). The [video in question](https://youtu.be/3hGnxYuKlzs) does come from James O'Keefe, but it isn't even close to faked. The regional field director for the Sanders campaign openly admits to voting in New Hampshire despite living in Colorado.

What should we make of these incidents? While much of this is just probably politics as usual, is it concerning in light of Sanders' promises about negative campaigning?


EDIT!!!!

Apparently, since no one wants to read the New Hampshire Union Leader article, or watch 2 minutes of a James O'Keefe video, I guess that I should just summarize the situation here. First off, I know that James O'Keefe is not usually to be trusted, but this one is proved by outside facts. What happened is that two Sanders Campaign Staffers, Hugo Palma Jr. and Donna Waterman, registered to vote in the New Hampshire Primary, even though they both live primarily out of state. We know that this is the case since the City Clerk confirmed that those names were on the voter rolls. That isn't necessarily a problem since you merely need to prove ""domicile"" to vote in the NH primary. ""A domicile is that place, to which upon temporary absence, a person has the intention of returning."" The problem is that they registered their domicile as the campaign headquarters, which said in its lease that it cannot be used residentially. So they committed voter fraud since the building cannot be a domicile, even if they slept there. Plain and Simple.

Edit 2: To anyone downvoting me because these feel like anti-Sanders smears: why not discuss how to spin these down the road? You will need practice. The General is very dirty. That O'Keefe piece might not seem like much since he is a known liar, but he did beat ACORN. FOX will not care that he is a liar. They will care that it can hurt Bernie. Please use this as an exercise to prepare for how to spin attacks. As a Clinton Fan, I speak from experience. You will need that skill.",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

They talk about how the US went through the Civil War, Jim Crow Segregation Era, Abortion Clinic Bombings/Extremism, Vietnam War Protests, etc. 

However, at least in the latter half of the events listed above, it seemed that the Federal government made an active effort to stamp out radical factions in the country that sought to destabilize it: 

1. The FBI systematically cut down the power and influence of the KKK via COINTELPRO and other investigations that downsized the organization considerably. 
2. The Federal Government helped in routinely enforcing desegregation in public schools, facilities, organizations, etc. 
3. The losing candidate in the presidential election was willing to accept the election results and step down when their party lost. The amount of heat Nixon faced for Watergate seems practically unimaginable in today's day and age. 

Most importantly, from each strife, came progress. We got the Voting Rights act in 1965, Jim Crowe Laws were ended, Desegregation occurred, *Roe v Wade*  helped enable access to abortions to millions of women across the country. 

However, I feel today, basic things like elections themselves aren't respected. Candidates that lose just cry ""fraud!!"" and accuse the opposite party of fudging the results. The ""culture war"" is getting worse, with systematic erosion of human rights that had been granted for so long (Abortion, Gay Marriage, even Voting Rights Act, etc.).

No doubt that many Central American migrants come from extremely violent communities.

Key question:  Are they *persecuted*--the key criteria--for their political beliefs or because of their race?

Persecution for ""political beliefs"" is what we see from dissidents fleeing Eygpt and Syria.

Persecution for ""race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group"" is what we see with Rohingya fleeing in Myanmar.  Or the persecution of Darfur, Sudan's non-Arab (black) population by Arabs.

In the above instances these people are sometimes fleeing both concentrated murderous attacks and pursuing death squads.

How can someone demand photo ID if it's not mandatory to have one.


In Czech Republic you're required to own a photo ID, and you can own additionally driving license and a passport. All of them can be used as a method of identification when voting. I think that you can use a birth certificate as well, and if you just got married and didn't have the time to get new IDs you can present copy of your marriage license with your old IDs.


But the point is that you HAVE to have photo ID. As far as I know, there is no federal, or state law in US requiring you to own a photo ID, than why require it? Or is there?


Why aren't more Americans fighting this? This isn't about preventing voter fraud, everyone, except for the likes of John Fund, knows that.


We also don't have voter registration. What is that? Seriously? Register to vote? I though it was a right.


We get in advance of elections an envelope with voting ballots and information where you're supposed to vote. You go there, bring your own ballots, or you can get new ones, put one into official (blue) envelope, and put it into ballot box. Done.


No voting machines, no nonsense.


How can Americans allow to get one of the basic things of democratic society wrong? Where did you go wrong?


(That is partly rhetorical question, I've been following GOP's voter suppression agenda for a long time now.)

Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the resignation was made known to King Willem-Alexander after a 2,5 hour meeting with the Council of Ministers.** 

The c[urrent affair](https://den.social/l/politics/isZLlNbXF2/dutch-government-collapsed-after-scandalous-childcare-allowance-affair/) is about 20 - 30K parents in debt and distress for many years due to the Dutch IRS / Tax Authority chasing them for falsely being flagged as 'fraudulent' with the childcare allowance.  There was discrimination in the system as well, targeted towards ethnical differences or people being seen as more likely to commit tax fraud if they had more than one nationality. These parents are receiving 30.000 euro compensation and possible more at a later stage if they had more damage.

In short, if the government labeled you as a fraudster, you were trapped in a legal injustice system causing great debt and stress, and as the victim you had to prove to the system that you didn't commit fraud, instead of the government needing to prove that you are indeed a fraudster or not (which they weren't).

Rutte acknowledges parents have suffered from great injustice due to a failing policy. The first priority will be financial compensation for the parents and improvements for the future. In the future Rutte wants to prevent injustices like this by building a new allowance system. Signals of failures should lead to action more quickly, and all information provision leading to any and all changes in the political system and laws will be made public and transparent by default. 

When it comes to the provision of information to the Parlement and journalists, Rutte wants to change things fundamentally, so issues similar to this can be prevented moving forward. Rutte ensures that all parents will be compensated as soon as possible, despite the government stepping down now. 

In the press release a journalist also asked about algorithms and automated labeling of data, for example people with two nationalities were by default already labeled as a higher risk for tax fraud. People are numbers instead of people. Civil servants are just 'doing their job', e.g. following systems and algo's instead of looking at things case by case in a human approach. The Prime Minister explained that this is also part of ongoing investigations.

She looked at me with this frazzled look as I walked in and told her I had to have notarization for my absentee ballot.
>
>We both read over the directions given, and I think we did everything right.  Was I supposed to vote in front of her so she could make sure I was the one voting?  I mean, she had to see my blank ballot, and then see me putting my completed ballot into the envelope.  She ordered me away to the other side of her cubicle to fill out the ballot.  Watching her impatience grow, I rushed through my ballot as fast as I could.  Once I finally completed it and sealed and signed the envelope, I handed it over.  Being a notary, she needed my identification, which is now a law but was not in place this year.  Her seal hardly embossed the thick ballot envelope.  I then gave her my application for ballot, which I needed for some reason even though I had my ballot right there, and I tried to decide if I needed to fill out the address part or if that would result in me receiving a second ballot or being convicted of voter fraud for trying to receive two ballots.  I decided to put both my address and “Do not mail – already received ballot” on the line.

>So I finally left the notary's office after taking quite a bit of her precious time and walked to the mail office.  I was about to put the envelopes in the mail when I noticed that the application for absentee ballot envelope did not have a “postage paid” square like the official ballot envelope.  Not seeing anything on the directions about this, I decided to call my county clerk just to make sure and the secretary told me yes, I did have to have postage for that envelope.  Isn't all official election mail supposed to be free to mail?  And even if it isn't, shouldn't that little .45 cent fee be covered with taxpayer money?  Do you not want all of your citizens to vote?  Not keeping postage on me at all times, I had to walk to the campus bookstore just to buy a single stamp, then back to the mail office to finally put the envelopes in the mail.
>
>My question is:  Why?  Why did it take me an hour to vote?  Why did it cost me money?  Why did I have to inconvenience someone else for something that is supposed to be a very private matter?  Why was I asked for my ID, when ID's are not provided for free in Mississippi?  Why was it so confusing?
>
>Something has to change with the way we handle absentee ballots.
>
>I care deeply for this country, and I care for who represents me, so I will fight tooth and nail to make sure that my vote is counted.  Luckily, I had an ID, and I had everything I needed within walking distance.  But even now, I'm afraid that I did something wrong and my vote will be discarded.  I am sure that of the thousands of young adults away at college, the men and women in the military, and other people who rely on absentee voting to be heard, a good percentage who received their ballots will not be counted this year.

But I will accept that some of the people who are supportive of voter ID laws purely out of their interest in eliminating voter fraud, and not for other more sinister motives, and so I'm interested in the idea of working to address their aims.

**How big banks came to be and why they suffocate our economy.**

**The New Normal**

As the story goes, the ""Great Recession"" ended in 2009.  Since that time, the US has had an uncommonly high unemployment rate of 8% and weak growth in GDP.  This lackluster economic ""recovery"" is part of the ""new normal"" economy; some academics say this ""new normal"" is part of a ""post-American exceptionalist"" reality, a reality in which American families are expected to be satisfied with less.

While average Americans are struggling to find jobs, and managing to survive on less, the stock market is telling a different story.  Wall Street is seeing equities prices break records, with the DOW Jones hitting an unprecedented $15,000.

This huge discrepancy between ""Main Street"" and ""Wall Street"" has many looking around and scratching their heads for an explanation of this economic paradox that exists in the ""new normal"" economy.

Some explain the unemployment by taking a ""Luddite route"" which claims joblessness should be blamed on new technologies created by the information revolution which are eliminating clerical jobs from the economy.  Thus businesses thrive on the savings created by new technology that replaces workers.  This is the argument most notably made by a journalist at the Economist.[1]  The problem with this theory is that it is based on a fallacy that has been disproven over and over again. (See: Luddite Fallacy) 

Another explanation is that outsourcing to emerging economies is eroding the industrial base of the US economy.  This claim is not supported by facts, in which analysis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is predicting an increase in industrial jobs in the current decade.[2]  Not to mention that the US as most western economies has already shifted to a post-industrial economy since the 80's. 

So if its not technology or globalization, what other explanation could there be for the high US unemployment?  What has so fundamentally changed in the World or the US economy that has ushered in the era of the ""new normal"" and American mediocrity?

Well that answer can be summed up into two words: Financial Convergence.

**Financial Convergence**

In the late 20th century economic thinkers, lawmakers,  and other policy makers took on the mentality that the US banking sector could benefit from broad liberalization policies.  Ideals like competition laws were seen as outmoded and too restrictive.  Words like investment bank and commercial bank were seen as arbitrary legal definitions handcuffing financial innovation.    

Part of this push for financial market liberalization was the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (or GBL).  Before the GBL, a financial institution that took deposits from customers, and gave loans to small businesses and houses were labeled a ""commercial banks.""  On the other end of the spectrum financial institutions that did not have depositors, rather investors, and invested in equities (stocks and bonds) and commodities, were labeled ""investment banks.""  These legal definitions were set by the Glass-Steagall Act (or GS) of 1933.  GBL repealed the GS.  After GBL, investment banks and commercial banks became one in the same.  Investment banks started taking deposits, and commercial banks started investing in equities. 

Since investment banks had long been involved in the equities market they were highly leveraged and had access to more capital from the fed due to its policies on reserve requirements.  Conversely commercial banks with smaller reserves had depended largely on depositor's money, and ""CDs"" (certificate deposit).  Since investment banks were in a more advantageous situation, they were able to buy out the smaller commercial banks.

It should not be surprising that some investments can be more profitable than others.  For example giving a loan to a small local business can be risky and not very profitable, conversely investing money in emerging market equities can be just as risky but this investment can be exceedingly profitable.  Both of these activities are equally legitimate and have a place in the economy, however they are unsimilar.      

The repeal of GS and the buyout of commercial banks led to preferences in certain financial activities over others.  Post-GLB banks could take money from depositors and invest it into equities.  Before, a commercial bank's investments were limited to traditional credit activities like small loans, and small businesses loans.  Since equities investment was more profitable than local credit activities, the latter was neglected in favor of the former.

With the line between commercial banking and investment banking removed, a revolution occurred in financial instruments.  New ways were created to fill the void created in traditional credit markets.  Banks ""innovated"" ways to make conventional lending more like the equities market.  Variable interest rates were utilized over fixed rates.  Mortgages were bundled together and sold.  

These activities allowed the banks to engage in widespread fraud.   Customers were bait-and-switched with teaser rates on variable APRs.  Mortgage bundles were packaged in a way that used math tricks to make them seem more sound than they actually were. 

In economics this type of market situation is referred to informational asymmetry. It is a phenomenon that can exist in almost any market, but it occurs when one buyer or seller has more important information than the other.
     
The Federal government's inaction to this widespread fraud could be explained as ineptitude, collusion, or confusion.  Regardless, the inaction cannot be blamed on free market dogma, because these fraudulent practices are the antithesis of market capitalism. Capitalism is founded on consensual economic activity.  Fraud is the subversion of consent, it is a form of theft.

**2008 to Today**

In 2008 the recession was a victory for capitalism.  Banks who were using fraudulent tactics to make a profit went bankrupt.  The fraudulent tactics finally caught up to the big banks.

Warning this paragraph is purely speculation:  2008 crisis would have been the solution to bad banking, if the government would have allowed the banks to fail, and resolved to fight fraud in the future.  Insolvent bank's profitable assets would have been bought in the open market, and its toxic assets would have been bought as well, but for their actual value(next to nothing).  Some of these banks would survive and would have been restructured, and some would even come back stronger with new leadership that might have tried to avoid past mistakes.

What did happen however, was completely opposite to this ideal situation.  A new phrase entered the American lexicon, that phrase was ""too big to fail.""  The banking industry and its army of lobbyist set out to scare the hell out of the American congress.  They told representatives that if their companies were allowed to fail, then it would be armageddon.  If armageddon occurred  then voters will be mad, and congressman might lose their job.  

The US Congress, possibly acting in fear, passed legislation to give the largest banks, which had been complicit in fraud, $1 Trillion dollars of public money.

Some small things were done to try and prevent the situation in 2008 from occurring again.  One in particular was the ""Frank-Dodd"" Act, that promised to ""end too big too fail.""  The legislation does some good things like combining all financial regulatory agencies into one group. Other than that, and some vague promise to regulate derivatives, the financial industry is more or less the same as it was before the 2008 crisis. Financial convergence survived the market's attempt to kill it. 

**Stuck in a Rut**

What does financial convergence, have to do with unemployment today?

In the south we have a saying: ""stuck in a rut.""  According to the Cambridge dictionary ""stuck in a rut"" means: 


If a person, organization, etc. is in a rut, they have become too fixed in one particular type of job, activity, method, etc.

There is an economic theory called ""liquidity trap"" which basically means ""stuck in a rut.""  

""Liquidity trap"" theory was formulated by Keynesian economist. To understand it you have to know a little about Keynes.  Keynes believed some controversial things.  First off he believed that economies had a ""liquidity preference.""  This in layman terms means people love money, and they love it too much; meaning that people rather keep money under a mattress than invest or spend.  If you can see why this might be bad, then you already can understand Keynes next controversial point:  the ""paradox of thrift"" theory.   Basically the ""paradox of thrift"" theory says that when a lot people save money, that it is bad for the economy, because if you are saving money you are not buying goods and services; if you are not buying goods or services then people get fired, and businesses go out of business.

Now The main way the US is currently trying to combat the recession and unemployment today is the Federal Reserve is using its ""monetary policy"" to kick start the economy.  The goal of monetary policy during a recession is to inject as much money into the economy as possible.  This is done by buying treasury bonds off the market, and lending money to banks at a ""discount rate.""  This strategy is commonly referred to as an ""easy money policy.""  The techniques were refined by the economic school of ""monetarism.""

Since 2008 the fed has adopted this easy money policy.  Today the results appear to be mixed.  In some areas of the economy like the stock market things are good, yet elsewhere in the economy results are less dramatic.

On top of this, despite of the easy money policy of the fed, many everyday people with good credit records are having a hard time getting access capital, to buy cars and homes.  While Main Street has no access to credit many businesses, and especially banks are flush with cash.  Even though banks have easy access to cheap credit, they only lightly invest in low risk equities like blue-chip stocks and AAA bonds. 

The problem created by this phenomenon is that banks using low interest leverage from the fed are investing in established companies who are not in need of credit or capital since they are also flush with cash. On the other end of the business spectrum, small businesses cannot gain access to credit and capital to expand their businesses.  Even more troubling aspiring entrepreneurs are even less likely to get credit to start a small business.  This is a major problem because small businesses employ over half of private sector employees in the economy.[3]  

Knowing this information, it is easy to see why Wall Street is breaking profit and price records, while Main Street can't find a job or start a business. 

American exceptionalism is not dead.  Americans can still innovate, they can still work hard, they can still take big risks and succeed.  This potential, however, is being suffocated because of the lack of access to crucial capital that is required to start a small business.  The dynamic potential of the American economy is eager to break loose and maintain America's lead in the global economy.  Unfortunately today, ""too big to succeed"" banks are being showered with money by the Federal Reserve.  They are intoxicated by their huge influxes of capital, in which they sit on as if it were a throne.  They are not going to invest in job creators, because of risk aversion and their lack of imagination.  These banks are currently leading the US into an era of mediocrity.  If we truly want put Americans back to work, and revive American exceptionalism, ""too big to succeed"" banks must be dismantled.  In the next few days I will list and detail some of the possible ways this can be achieved.

Jane Sanders was the president of Burlington College, a small college in Vermont. In 2010, she planned an expansion. The real estate she had her eyes on for the school had a hefty price tag of $10 million dollars as compared to the school's revenue of $4 million. Obviously loans(tax exemption bond) of that size need some credit so the state wanted $2.3 million in guaranteed commitment. 

She said they had $2.6 million dollars in guaranteed commitments over the next 5 years which made the school eligible for the loan. However, one of the commitments was actually a bequest of $1 million dollars over the next five years, which cannot be used as a guarantee because none of the money had even been paid out yet. 

An audit of the university shows they had only $1.3 million in short and long term pledges for the year. That $1 million is actually accounted for here.

123,Top Issues with American Government Disscussion,9.0,2c1q2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2c1q2f/top_issues_with_american_government_disscussion/,86.0,1406646090.0,"I believe that there are many issues with our current state of government, however I believe that within all of these issues there are 5 simple issues that spread throughout and are the major issues we need to reform within our government to fix the majority of government issues, not country issues such as immigration, but rather issues like a lame congress or lobbying buying votes.

Here is my essential list:

1. Campaign Funding Reform; too much of our politicians effort is to get re-elected rather than to get issues fixed and laws passed. I recently read that on average politicians spend around 50% of their terms trying to obtain money for their next.

2. Lobbyists buy Votes; In general, Americans votes don't amount to anything, if you have money, you matter, the citizens do not decide what should be focused on or what matters, the companies with billions in their pockets tell the politicians what matters via legal bribery, which is insane in a ""democratic"" country. This also leads back to the first issue we have with campaign funding. We need to get money out of politics.

3. Congress is run by Babyboomers; The average age of a House member in 2013 was 55 and the average age of a senator was 60! Not only are these the oldest ages in more than a century, or ever in the Senate, this puts most of them out of touch. These Babyboomers have all of the political power within the government, and although the age that you can start to serve is 25 and 30, rarely does anyone that age ever get elected. These older people live with older values and do not live have majority of the modern practices, but rather just control the ones they want. We need more diversity of age within our government. Link to the age article http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15348258/ns/politics/t/grayest-congress/

4. Two-Party System; The use of the two-party system is outdated for our modern views. Nothing is black and white, and neither should our choices for politicians. We need a strong third party to bring more choice and again diversity to the politics. If your choice's range from 1 to 10 but you can only choose 1 or 10 to vote for, that leaves a lot out of the middle that is necessary. With more middle party politicians there can be more partisanship for laws to be worked with and having no one be the majority forces issues to come to compliance, rather then yelling across the aisle and also prevents bullying your issues on the American public. I understand majorities are voted in and therefore that is what is wanted by most, however gerrymandering and corporation control blows that out of proportion from the American republic.

5. The Electoral College; The electoral college is out of date, American citizen votes don't matter rather than whoever is in charge of placing the final electoral college votes that win out the elections. Counting 300 million votes individually is no simple task, and voter fraud would be found yes, but not enough to sway the elections for large positions like the President. A different system must be adopted. If you believe that the system is fair, I recommend watching these CGP Grey videos explaining the issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k&list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w and  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHEDXzOfENI&list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w

These are all my personal opinions, but let us discuss this issue. I would like to know your opinions on these issues and lets discuss it all, comment away!!

They seem to be totally unaware of the following: 

* Bill Clinton didn't invade Iraq in the 8 years he was in office. 
* The spirit of the times in 2002 was that we should stick together and support the president, even if you didn't agree with him
* Bad intel was foisted off on members of Congress
* For that matter, it was a mostly Republican congress

The bottom line is, if Gore had been president, we wouldn't have invaded Iraq. There is evidence to suggest Bush had planned to invade Iraq BEFORE 9-11 happened. Or even before he was in office. His reasons for doing so were, quite possibly, somewhat personal (Saddam tried to murder his father). Could Bush have been presented with bad intel as well? Possibly. But the buck stops with him. 

So blaming people for supporting a president in a time of strife seems like a cheap attack. And it matters because, as we consider our leaders going forward, you've got to give the Democrats some credit for not engaging in frivolous or ""optional"" wars. I know quite a few Republicans who think Obama is ""weak"". When pressed on what they think he should be doing, usually they seem to think we should be deploying soldiers somewhere (the Ukraine, elsewhere).

Jeb Bush is absolutely 100-percent correct. Asians, Chinese in particular, are taking advantage of ""anchor babies"" to abuse the American system. It is a fraud that has been happening on a massive scale right here, at where I live, in the San Gabriel Valley area, Los Angeles, in Southern California. The San Gabriel Valley is a Chinese enclave.  It is likely going on in other Chinese and Asian enclaves.  You see, China does not have a dependable social safety net for retirees and old people.  So here is how many Chinese people coming from mainland China are creating their own ""social safety net"" - by ripping off the US:

Chinese women who are in their early pregnancy would hide their pregnancy and fly to the US. Then, they would stay in the US, often extending their visitor VISA during the stay, until their babies are born.  Those babies are - *ta-da!* - US birthright citizens aka ""anchor babies"".  After giving birth, the women would immediately fly back to China with their newly minted ""American"" babies. Those babies would grow up in China, attend schools in China, socialize in China, and come to think themselves as Chinese.  They grow up to think of Chinese people - *not* Americans - as their countrymen. So they are loyal to China, *NOT* the US.  Of course, they were born in the US, so they are eligible to run for and become the US President. They are the actual Manchurian Candidates in the making.

Let's get back to the original plan of the Chinese mothers.  When those Chinese anchor babies grow up and turn 18, they would return to the US.    As natural-born birthright US citizens, they can petition for their Chinese parents to become US permanent resident.  Their parents, who would already be old and retired, would become permanent residence.  In a few years, they would become US citizens. Once those Chinese parents become US citizens, they would apply - and receive - all the social welfare goodies offered by the US, including (but not limited to) Medicaid and SSI.  SSI is Supplementary Social Security payments.  People who receive SSI do not have to have paid into the system to receive payments. They just have to be either poor and disabled. So, those newly-immigrated Chinese parents - who are old, have no income, and have never worked in the US and have never paid a dime into the system - will receive SSI and Medicaid when they become citizens through their ""birthright"" American citizen children.

That is how Chinese people are creating their own social safety net when their own country lacks one: they are taking advantage of birthright citizenship in the US.  I see it happening around me all the time. I know plenty of Chinese living here who have done it. I have met plenty of old Chinese people who are now  living here and are receiving all kinds of benefits - simply because their children were born here.  Of course, not every Chinese parent can afford to this do this in the first place. A pregnant Chinese woman would have to have some money, connections and information to be able to travel to and stay in the US to give birth. However, I know Chinese who have done this/are doing this/plan to do this are numbered in the hundreds of thousands if not millions. Here in the San Gabriel Valley area where I live, there are even businesses that carter to ""visiting"" pregnant Chinese women.

I suspect other Asians may be doing the same thing. I do not know for sure.  However, Chinese are definitely doing this, on a mass scale.   I personally do not like it because I pay taxes.  I do not want those Chinese mofos come over here to rob the system that I have been paying into.

 It's a legal complaint penned to a federal DA and IG with some very unkind things to say about Jane Sanders' time as President of Burlington College in Vermont. Apparently she attempted to broker the purchase of a Catholic Diocese HQ in Vermont using loans that were contingent on $2.6 million in grants or donations put up by the college.

The college wound up massively under target for fundraising, and in 2011, Jane Sanders was let go as President of the school and pushed out of its board of trustees, but was awarded a $200,000 severance package.

They ended up only bringing in $676,000 of the promised $2.6 million in donations and defaulted on the loan. This particular lawyer alleges it cost the Diocese that sold its HQ somewhere between $1.6 and $2 million, which then hurt the Diocese ability to help the needy families of Vermont.

Now, these are all allegations, filed by a lawyer representing a group of Vermont Catholics affected by the situation. We should be clear that these are, as of now, allegations, though there seems to be an abundance of media backing them up, and Sanders was indisputably let go from her positions at the school, with a large severance package.

They are requesting a federal investigation, and alleging that she committed bank fraud. 

Sanders supporters, does this affect your views of Bernie and/or his wife? Is it a baseless accusation drummed up by the media, or does it have any legs? I'm honestly curious because this is the first I'm hearing of the situation.

Mods, please feel free to tag this with something if need be since they are alleged actions.

TL;DR:

* Jane Sanders in 2010, as President of Burlington College, bought land from Catholic Diocese by promising school would put up $2.6 mil in funds eventually as leverage for loans
* School failed to fundraise effectively and wound up collecting less than 25% of funds, Jane was let go as President/trustee
* She secured $200,000 severance package, faced no legal action
* Law firm representing group of Vermont Catholics requesting federal investigation for alleged bank fraud

Here are Several issues that I personally believe can turn politics around in the United States -

1.) Corporations are not persons -

They have the full obligation to pay taxes under existing tax laws, but they are not an entity with personhood, and enjoy none of the rights extended to individual citizens.

The charters of Corporations are a created government entity, and they can just as easily be revoked by government. You can revoke a Charter, but you can not so easily revoke a life.

2.) Congress and Lobbying -

Every member of Congress who, directly or indirectly, takes money from any Lobbying Group, Political Action Committee, or other group promoting any social, economic, political or other agenda, will abstain from voting on any issue or agenda promoted by said Lobbying Group, PAC, or other groups for a period of One Full Year.

Any member of Congress who violates this amendment will be subject to the full force of Fraud, Corruption, Graft, and if necessary Racketeering laws. On this issue there can not now nor ever be any Congressional immunity for Corruption.

If the one year limit is observed, but a pattern of favoring those who donate money can be established, again, no immunity and the full force of the law will be applied. No Congressional Immunity.

Despite what the Supreme Court said, money is NOT speech, money is influence. And while every entity personal or corporate has a right to make its voice heard, it does not have the right to buy influence in the government with CASH.

3.) Insider Trading -

The full force of the Insider Trading Laws will be applied to all members of Congress, and further all members of government. Again, no Congressional Immunity.

The average citizen gets about a 3% to 6% return on his investments; however, members of Congress somehow magically get a 10% to 30% or more return on their investments, which can only happen through Insider Trading.

No Insider Trading, and no Congressional Immunity on this issue.

The core issue, and the means by which I would Amend the Constitution is to make it so that No member of Congress will be immune from any law. If they make the laws, then they live by them. And this includes crimes as minor as Traffic Violations.

I think those issues are critical. Though there may be others, if these three Amendments can be implemented, corruption in Congress and bought influence would drop to nothing.

Part 2 -

The Tea Party wants an amendment that says the budget must always be balanced. I really don't think they have thought this through. That means massive taxes on the Rich every time something needs to be funded. Why? Because the rich are the only ones with enough money to pay for massive spending projects.

1.) Balanced Budget Amendment -

The Republican have been spending like crazy since 1980 when Regan took office. Regan Tripled the National Debt, Bush doubled it. So, spending needs to either be funded or restrained. But it is the Republicans who are engaging in unfunded and unrestrained spending. I think when it gets right down to it, a Balanced Budget Amendment is not a good idea. But, I agree, there needs to be some constraint on spending.

2.) The War Tax -

Their should be an Amendment that say that anytime the USA engages in any military action by any name or for any purpose, it must be funded by a War Tax. And in my opinion, a Progressive War Tax, it is always the poor who fight wars to the benefit of the rich. So, the rich should have to contribute a fair and reasonable share., or go fight the war themselves.

Now the War Tax doesn't have to last as long as the war itself. It took us a few years to overcome the debt of WW-II, but the War Tax last until the war is paid for.

But it is a specific tax direct only at a specific war. The money doesn't go into general revenue and it is used for specifically one and only one purpose. This is NOT a military spending tax, it goes specifically to pay for a specific wars or military/police action and nothing else.

This applies to any and all military actions, direct or indirect, by any name.

Further I feel that those who serve in combat AND THEIR FAMILIES should be automatically immune from the War Tax.

I repeat, this is not a tax to generally fund the Military, they already get way too much. This is a Tax to offset any debt that might occur due to military action. Even if actual Debt does not occur, the money funds the action, not the military in general. 

3.) National Debt Tax -

The burden of the National Debt Tax is outrageous. The only way to pay it down is with a steeply Progressive Debt Tax. Again, let those who spend and those who benefited pay the money back. This could be a way around the No Debt Amendment. Rather than saying No National Debt, we instead say, no UNFUNDED National Debt. We can carry the Debt for a while, but before we spend, we have to have a funded plan to pay the money back.

To use an analogy, this is like you going down to the Bank to take out a loan. You establish how much you are going to borrow, how much interest you are going to pay, and the term or time within which you will pay it back.

No more of this alleged borrow in lean times and let the good times pay it off, because that lends itself to borrowing in good times and bad.

Every event that creates debt will independently incur a Debt Tax to pay for it. Each Debt with its own term and repayment plan.

I also want these War and Debt Taxes itemized on every paycheck, so each citizen can see precisely where his money is going.

4.) Social Security -

While this doesn't necessarily need to be an Amendment, it absolutely needs to be addressed.

Congress robbed, and I mean criminally robbed, the Social Security Trust Fund. Then after they robbed our money, they are making us pay the money back. We are in essence paying our Social Security TWICE. Once from our pay check, and once again, in general taxes to pay back the money Congress robbed from us.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue -

- a.) 25% reduction in the Congressional budget including Congressional Pay and Pensions; existing Pensions included.

- b.) Next, the Congressional Pension money will be moved into the Social Security Trust fund, and members of Congress, past and present, will draw pensions at the standard rate from Social Security. They get out in proportion to what they paid in, and at the standard rates that apply to everyone else.

- c.) Next, the Congressional Health Plan will end. All members of Congress, in office or out, will lose the Congressional Health Plan and will instead be on Medicare. If the want to purchase additional health care they are free to do so with their own money.

How fast do you think Medicare Benefits will expand once Congress is on the Plan? 

- d.) The implementation of a PROGRESSIVE Social Security Repayment Tax. Once again, a specific tax for a specific purpose. The Tax will last as long as it takes to repay the trust fund with the money that was Robbed. And I think this should be a Steeply Progressive Tax. Let those who robbed, and those who benefited, pay back the money.


5.) The Right of Citizens to Gather Evidence -
The Constitution guarantees citizens the right to present evidence in their defense in a court of law.

By extension, that means I have the further implied right to gather evidence in my defense unimpeded and unhindered by the courts, the police, the prosecution, or any other entity, as long as the gathering of that evidence is otherwise with in the bounds of standard and common law, and/or within the standards for evidence gathering.

This has to do with citizens video taping the police, government officials, government agencies, and any and all crimes committed in public, or any other governmental interaction. Though I would make an exception for covert government actions that are otherwise within the bounds of the law. In short, with few rare exceptions, it would be unwise to video tape undercover police. But we must make sure that exception does not prevent the gather of real and worthwhile evidence by citizens.

There should be a Constitutional Amendments that guarantee Citizens, or their agents, the free unfetter right to gather evidence to be used in their defense or to be used in the defense of person's for whom they are acting as agents.

The police, the prosecution, the courts, & no other governmental or private agency or private entity has the right to interfere with or block the gather of that evidence.

The further extension of this right, is the right to document ""Town Hall"" or other ""Public Meetings"", political speeches, and similar events. I'm not sure about the right of the citizens to document public court trials, though, on th e other hand, they ARE public trials. But that is an issue that can be dealt with, as it doesn't necessarily fall into the realm of evidence gathering and thereby constitutes a separate issue.

6.) Freedom for Religion, but also freedom from Religion -

In the Bill of Right it is stated that the government will not restrict nor promote the free exercise of Religion, and while it is implied in other places that Religion and Government will stay separate, this concept needs to be further extended.

There should be a Constitutional Amendment that specifically says, no Religious scripture, doctrine, tenants, philosophy, beliefs, or policies that are not otherwise a commonly accepted Secular concepts can be implemented into Law, or in anyway codified into government at any level.

In short, government must stay out of religion, and religion must stay out of government.

However, the tax-exempt status of Religion should only extent to direct work of the Church and legitimate tax exempt and charitable work. Any money the Church spends supporting various political causes, or similar social activism will be taxed at the standard rates. This applies to any non-church or non-charity related activity of the church. As long as you confine your actions to direct religious and charitable work, you keep your tax exempt status. But any social or political activism will be taxed at the standard rate.

Some will say this last bit is unnecessary. But much as I see the Government being taken over by corruption, I see Religion being taken over by corruption. Those using the name of God to further the most un-Christian of agendas. This last Amendment assures that corruption does not enter Govt under the false name of God.",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud
137,Failure From the Top Down; the Snowden Chronicles,8.0,1g2fsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1g2fsj/failure_from_the_top_down_the_snowden_chronicles/,4.0,1370895216.0,"The recently revealed data gathering on the part of the US government is the culmination of failures at nearly every level of our society, save the individual, which finds its expression in Edward Snowden.

According to Rep. Peter King, he is “dangerous to the country”, but in reality this guy isn't the problem, or a danger for that matter. If nothing, this man is a patriot. While I am not defending his actions outright; I have too little information to do that, his exposure to this program is certainly now at an end, and all the “danger” he poses now is as a spokesperson or a martyr. Care should be exercised, regardless of his level of deviation from the law, that he remain (and be encouraged to be) the former rather than become the latter. His actions, illegal though they are, fall well within the lines of civil disobedience exercised with reason and prudent consideration of the consequences not for himself, but for the nation. Knowledge that this program exists simply does not need to be Top Secret. Do you really think that anyone trying to hide their associations isn't cloning telephones and routing data through false IPs?

If Mr. Snowden wished to be a danger, he would have disclosed details of the program, not the program's existence itself.

From the top down, the US Government has failed its citizenry in the FBI's request to the FISC on behalf of the NSA. Whether or not you support the Patriot Act, it has been both passed and renewed by our elected representatives. The care with which it should be applied has evidently not been monitored, and so we have an indication, as many privacy advocated have accused, that the law is more porous than it ought to be if a court would permit an interpretation as egregious as this.

Not realizing that a patriotic citizen might perform this act of civil disobedience underpins the truly horrific nature of this order and the system that begot it. Truly, the litmus test for whether a government should ever exercise its authority in a covert manner is whether a breach of this sort might transpire through the acts of one of its loyal citizens.

Failure!

That our elected representatives on the Senate Intelligence Committee, including the slightly more noble Sens. Wyden and Udall, were unwilling to be whistle blowers themselves illustrates a moral failing in our elected representatives. Certainly, if a US Senator feels the need to “hint” at something he shouldn't be hinting at, then he should know that he ought not be circumspect. As a citizen patriot sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution, he should know that the Patriot Act is just an Act, and that the overriding precept of the Constitution is that it “outranks” mere laws, even the important ones. What's more, I hardly expect a rogue Senator to carry the same level of risk at disclosure than Mr. Snowden.

When it comes down to it, had a sitting Senator blown a whistle, I find it hard to believe that he would end up in the stockades. Rather, the debate would be elevated and the political will of the people would surely have defended him in a way that I'm not quite sure it will for Mr. Snowden. Our politicians are risk-averse when it comes to advocating for the citizenry, as a result of our politics and the introverted nature of the political world, and it has left our Constitution woefully undefended.

Failure!

That Mr. Snowden was not a US Government employee, but instead worked for the private consulting firm of Booz Allen Hamilton, signals yet another layer of failure. The outsourcing of work so deeply entrenched in our national security interests that it causes such an uproar upon its disclosure is simply unacceptable by any reasonable definition of discretion. Outsourcing to private companies, let alone one held by a globally interested Private Equity [Carlyle] firm, many of whose interests are capitally rather than patriotically oriented, is the pinnacle of poor decision making in an intelligence  field where controlling information is the bellwether by which performance can be measured.

Failure!

The screening process that permitted Mr. Snowden, a presumably honorably discharged, yet, in the formal sense, woefully uneducated individual, to access this information, must also be called into question. Clearance is administered by the Federal Government, and this process must either be considered wholly effective, in which case this breach signals Mr. Snowden's patriotism, or defective because it permitted someone who clearly embraces a worldview that values freedom over government to pursue this course of action.

Failure!

No executive at Verizon, and certainly not the team of executives, stood up and refused this order. To any reasonable person of merit, this order signals something deeply wrong with the execution of the law by which it derives its interpretation. At worst, it constitutes literally hundreds of millions of unconstitutional searches.

Think about it this way: would the FBI been able to obtain any warrants to search a citizen's house for their phone bill to obtain this same information without cause? Scale matters here, and the fact that more than one entity (Verizon and the customer) has access to this data does not mean that obtaining a warrant pell-mell for the information is any more constitutional than the IRS receiving daily updates of every individual's bank accounts in order to detect tax fraud. The IRS does get reports on the big transactions, but it is the banks that provide it, as it should be here with Verizon*.

Verizon's executives had neither the interests nor the courage to propel them to simply not comply. Complicity is the enemy of reason, and the number of scenarios by which this order could have been alluded to publicly. No disclosure of the order need have been made, simply a lack of compliance and let the chips fall where they may. After all, is the government going to sue Verizon out of business, stranding the American people who are its shareholders to destitution for that part of their portfolios?

Failure!

Mr. Snowden, finally, didn't tell his family, as far as we know, that he was about to do what he's done. Presumably, that was not to worry them. I can't help but think, though, that his mother's response would have been eerily close to that of my own mother's. That he should come to his senses, keep his head down, not ruin his life, and that others know better than he. In point of fact, families love each other and when a member is exposed to the threat of reprisal, this response is normal and healthy.

At the same time, this response that I have assigned the poor Mrs. Snowden (apologies, my dear), and the act of protection (for even a day) that her son most likely performed, indicates that our families are failing. There was a time, generations distant for the most part, where nearly every mother, despite her love and fears, proudly sent her sons off to war to defend our Great Nation. That Mr. Snowden presumably could not count on that same encouragement, from family, friends, and community to quite literally risk his life in the service of his nation, is a sad thing. On this last point, only, do I hope I'm gravely mistaken.

*In a marginally related sidenote: Why was there no protocol set up to query specific data from this database while creating a simple, one to one encrypted hash for personal information and GPS data? The NSA and CIA have exceptionally gifted cryptographers and statisticians who certainly have the ability to cull meaningful information from anonymous data with the same rigor, sophistication, and alacrity whether or not they can see specific data. A hash could have been created, sent to Verizon, and the data transmitted back could have been fully analyzed and queried through the hash to Verizon's database to deliver real-time, meaningful information. If I can think of it, they surely can, and if the judge ruling on this order could not, or did not consider this as a better alternative, then the failure gains yet another layer.",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud
138,From someone uneducated in politics: Does democracy need to be fixed? (and are these ideas rubbish?),9.0,xic1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/xic1m/from_someone_uneducated_in_politics_does/,40.0,1343834654.0,"In the past, I floated through life not bothering myself at how my government was being run. It was a peaceful existence requiring little to no thought on my part which was propped up by the idea that smarter people than me were in charge and the decisions they make are based on what they believe is best for the country as a whole. Sometimes I may not have agreed with a decision but I generally had no education on the subject so who was I to question it? So for years I have just been voting along the party lines I grew up with. 
With the onset of age, along with its close friends mistrust and cynicism, it became apparent that there are many politicians with vested interests and others of questionable intellect who were quite obvious puppets for other faceless men. I used to dismiss the conspiracy theories put forward by various people about the people behind the scenes who are *actually* running the country, but they are starting to make more and more sense the more I learn.
I have a general rule that if I’m going to whinge about something, the least I can do is offer up a solution… But what kind of a solution is there to democracy? Other government types seem to be even more susceptible to corruption. So I was just thinking about what possible improvements could be made with todays, (or tomorrows), technology in mind. Before I start I’d like to stress that I have no education in political science or any related subjects, I just like to get angry at the news.

1: Make and informed vote count more.
	I’m sick and tired of lies presented as fact in campaigns, and the candidate with the most money blanket advertising crap to mislead stupid people. A 10 question multiple choice or T/F test when you vote for your candidate may be one option. This test could be optional and if you got enough right, perhaps your vote could equal 2 votes. The questions could be based on the current sate of the economy, or the facts behind some of the major issues. Basically I’m trying to make a politician running for office be a bit more honest and open about the reasons why they take a particular stance and encourage voters to educate themselves and therefore make a more informed decision.

2: Let us control the budget.
	Let us vote each year for which areas of the government our tax dollars are gong towards. Of course there would need to be a few safeguards put in place to stop departments collapsing from underfunding. Perhaps a minimum amount of money must be allocated to each department beforehand. Along with this maybe another amount on top of this could be allocated to the government departments based on the amount they received the previous year to buffer against giant cutbacks. The rest could be ours to decide what to do with and could allocated using a preference based voting system. (Important side note; only a very small percentage of the departments budget should be allowed to be used for advertising.)

3: Let us have a say in the major decisions:
	This idea may not really tenable at the moment, but maybe we could be consulted with big decisions like marching off to war or bailing out a bank. State your case and we can decide if it’s in our best interest or not. Smartphones are fast becoming an indispensible part of daily life, maybe they can come with a preinstalled app specifically to vote on bills going through parliament. If its something you have no interest in, your lack of voting on the issue means you abstain. If you care deeply about the subject matter, why not another 10 question test specifically about the bill to attempt to make your vote worth double again. The downside of this is the susceptibility to hacking, but its not really much different from the kind of fraud that is already happening. While it may seem a bit far fetched to rely on everyone eventually having a smartphone, keep in mind that once upon a time you didn’t need to have an account at a bank to function in society.

	These are just some unstructured brainfarts from someone hopelessly uneducated in the subject matter. As well as this, the fact that I’m slightly sleep deprived may mean that I’m thinking that these are way better ideas than they actually are. I just wanted to float them out there on the internet while I could be bothered doing so. Also, let me know if someone has already come up with this or something similar, I’m interested to read about it.

139,What should the US foreign policy be towards Venezuela? Why?,7.0,jaa554,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/jaa554/what_should_the_us_foreign_policy_be_towards/,14.0,1602581964.0,"Extremely brief context: Venezuela is an oil rich country in South America. Hugo Chavez became the President in 1998 and held office until his death in 2013. During this time there was a surge in oil prices, Venezuela's main export, and this money went to a mix of things like social programs and healthcare as well as was lost to massive fraud and corruption. The US, for many reasons, did not like Chavez. In 2013 he died while in office and his Vice President, Nicolas Maduro, subsequently became the leader - confirmed quickly by election. Even in 2013 Venezuela was already experiencing problems related to deflated oil prices and widespread corruption, but since 2013 the situation has become exponentially worse. Today more than 10% of the population has fled, there is widespread hunger and lack of access to basic commodities, and there are now two President's claiming authority - Maduro and the leader of the opposition, Juan Guaidó. The situation is very, very bad and getting worse.

I am curious **what the policy options are for the US**?

1. Trade embargo/ sanctions.
   1. Good: it restricts the flow of capital available to Maduro
   2. Bad: it hurts the people of the country by making access to basic goods even more difficult, and people in precarious situations are more easily controlled by a dictator.
2. Open trade.
   1. Good: Helps the people get access to necessities
   2. Bad: this legitimizes the rule of an illegitimate ruler (Maduro has refused to hold free and fair elections)
3. Act as intermediary between Maduro and Guaidó.
   1. Good: Reconciliation is often an important step towards advancing a country towards peace and stability.
   2. Bad: Maduro will be granted concessions and he won't face justice for what he's done.
   3. Additional note: Maduro has no reason to come to the table as he will inevitably lose power.
4. Provide massive humanitarian aid.
   1. Good: Fewer people die.
   2. Bad: Continues to entrench Maduro's power (as the population looks externally for solutions to internal problems).
5. Invade.
   1. Good: Forcibly deposing Maduro could theoretically open the possibility that someone else can become President.
   2. Bad: Long history of US abuse of military power in Latin America.

The US has a long history of helping its international corporations at the expense of the people in the area, so I am hesitant for the US to take any larger role in Venezuela then they have to, but that still doesn't answer the question of what the US should be doing, right now, to help the people of Venezuela.

What do you think/recommend politico's of Reddit, and why?

TL;DR: Venezuela's situation is bad. Historically the US doesn't help. What should the US be doing about it today?

I think the juxtaposition of these two documents indicates really clearly the path the current South African Regime is taking in relation to all property rights, which is to create the fundamental legal machinery necessary to direct State control over the use of and allocation of all and any property and rights therein, to whatever political constituency it thinks it needs to pay off to ensure it's ruling party's continuation in power, and which will allow political cronyism and patron client relationships, fraud and corruption on a scale not yet envisaged by the public and analysts at large.

The programs themselves need to be overhauled and revenue supporting them in the coming years increased must be increased. I propose a program which will serve as a transitional bridge from the existing system to a reformed one: 

**Creation of a Social Security & Wellness Government Bond program and market**

**1)** Enable the government issued identification of any authorized Social Security & Wellness benefits recipient to serve as a charge card for participating vendors. Purchases with the card do not immediately yield payment to the vendor. Instead it establishes a transaction bond of debt that the government guarantees to repay within a reasonable amount of time (call it 1 month). The debt can be redeemed at any time after the delay period but will begin to accrue interest after that time (explained below).

**2)** When a bond is issued it creates an entry in an electronic bond market that's run by the government (automated). This bond market allows anyone in the system (registered American citizen with a valid form of payment) to purchase the bond from the government for the price of the debt, free of tax. The money for the purchase is instantly given to the vendor and the bond is now owned by another individual.

**3)** The new bond holder can then either claim payment as soon as it's available or hold the bond while it accrues interest. This interest would come in the form of reduced federal income tax liability equal to the an increasingly larger percentage of the value that would be owed on the revenue for the bond. This value would increment a fixed percentage per month (say 10%). After reaching 100% in tax liability owed on the bond, the value will of the bond itself will increase at the same rate, up to a maximum value matching what the bond holder would've owed as taxable income. The percentage of gain would match your present or previous year's tax bracket, whichever is higher (this is important to prevent exploitation of the system).

**4)** There would need to be a cap of how much of your total annual tax liability could be waived in a given year. Though there's a clever way to make it quite generous: At 50% of your annual income if you do nothing but camp bonds for uncle Sam as 100% of your claimed earnings you can, at best, exempt yourself from income tax liability (which is actually quite a reasonable amount of money). However, since it pays profit based on your highest tax bracket within the last year, the next year you will receive no profits from the bonds. Even purchasing nothing but bonds, since you paid no taxes the prior year, you'd have a liability for 50% of your earnings (that would be neigh impossible to conceal). For sanity sake though, there must be a ceiling: Lets say $5,000,000 per year per person. A generous amount but it blocks exploitation of the system by the -very- rich while still providing ample encouragement to fuel the program.

**5)** There is a balance on the card which is refreshed weekly. Unspent portions from the previous week will roll over for those interested in saving for larger non-emergency purchases (pharmacies and medical care would be required to accept bond payment unless refusing service to the customer). The balance would updated in real time and be based on unsecured bonds on your account. If someone buys your debt bonds, you now have that balance available to spend again. You balance maximum can only increase from rollover though. This is to ensure that debt bond accrual cannot outrun bond purchase and that the distribution of debt bond purchase is as uniform as it can be.

**6)** The bond purchase system doesn't care what you buy with with the money, provided the vendor is participating and it isn't illegal. There would be a strict daily limit on cash back though (to minimize the burden of liquidity before debts are purchased). And only businesses which provide qualifying emergency services could allow you to exceed your available balance (the goal being to ensure emergent problems can be resolved before they become expensive). Additionally if emergency expenses exceed $5,000 in one month the weekly balance refresh is suspended until the card holder or emergency service vendor contacts an authorizing agent. This is for purposes of fraud/scam prevention (probably an easier way to implement this).

**7)** Being convicted of using bond purchase power to finance illegal activities would result in immediate suspension of non-emergency services (still more important to keep emergent costs under control). This would go on for the length of your jail sentence and any amount of probation/community service/criminal driving related license suspension. This would include flagging attempts to acquire cash with a bond purchase for review as a potential misdemeanor crime. The system would also abide a three strikes and you're out rule (three strikes and you're restricted to emergency services).

**8)** To improve the sustainability of the program, participants capable of working would be offered the chance to extend welfare benefits at a 1:1 ratio for hours worked. The government would organize projects or temporary jobs for employers paying a discounted wage rate. Non-government employers would be required to hire the temporary employee or end the contract after 1 month to prevent exploitation of low cost labor.
 
Everyone capable, especially the upper 1% would have every reason to buy these bonds. Though they'd also have a reason to want to keep reporting a taxable income to uncle Sam while they did it.

It's quite literally a government sanctioned tax haven without the risk of prison rape, provided you can sit on the bonds for 20 months. Except in this case the money wouldn't go to offshore accounts. Instead it would go back into the American economy, directly to the people who need it the most.

Even if you can't sit on the bond because you suddenly need cash you could always just sell it back to the market or cash it in prematurely. Any time after the first tick of interest and it's still a profit. And since most of the purchase values would be relatively small from vendor purchases, the market would be highly accessible to micro investing. Meanwhile the government gets to defer payment of debts, the needy receive the care they need and those helping them get paid for their good deed.

Would this not be a better solution to social security and medicare? Sure, it may be a brand of pseudo-socialism but it's a capitalist one.

Would appreciate feedback, suggestions of improvements, etc.

These DVDs were mailed to many people across the nation. It's pretty ridiculous. Basically, it's a bunch of conspiracy theory that Barrack Obama is a covert socialist hellbent on converting America to communism. (Never mind that those are two separate ideologies. That doesn't matter. They're the same exact thing if you don't care about details, or were educated during the Red Scare.)

It should be noted that everywhere on the cover that the term ""Real Father"" shows up, ""Real"" appears in red and is asterisked by a small Soviet Union Hammer and Sickle.

I knew I was in for a fun ride when the first thing that showed after pressing play was this:

 >""Director's Note: This film is based on actual events, interviews, and archives, as well as re-creations of probable events, using reasoned logic, and approximated conversations to provide a cohesive understanding of Obama's history.

 >Is this the story Barack Obama should have told, revealing his true political foundations and his agenda for fundamentally transforming America?""

The chapter list is as follows:

* 1) My Real Father is Frank Marshall Davis
* 2) My Gramps, Company Man
* 3) The Seduction of Ann Dunham
* 4) Marxism in Paradise
* 5) May 19th Communist College Years
* 6) Chicago's New Community Agitator
* 7) Harvard Law al-Mansour
* 8) ACORN'S Front Man in Chicagoland
* 9) Campaign for Radical Change
* 10) Socialist Dreams From Frank Marshall Davis

Basically, the tale reads as follows.

""Barrack Obama's *real* father was a card carrying member of the Communist Party of the United States, and was taking orders from the Soviets to spread the influence of communism through the black populace, and was apparently under FBI surveillance for a number of years. Obama's *real* father met Obama's mother in Hawaii, took some nude photos of her which he sold to magazines, and knocked her up. Obama's mother was in Hawaii because her father, Barrack's grandfather, was a CIA operative who was there to oversee the education of African immigrant students, one of whom was named Barrack Obama. If anyone found out that Obama's mother had had a child to a noted communist, Obama's grandfather would lose his security clearance. Also, Obama's *real* father already had a wife and children, and so did not want that being known to his circle of people either. So they arranged a marriage to the immigrant student from Kenya, Barrack Obama, to save face.

After being introduced to his *real* father at the age of twelve, young Barrack was indoctrinated into socialist extremism. 

Blah blah blah, socialist this, communist that, muslim the other thing, and Islam the bit over there.""

Throughout all of this, they've managed to tie him to everything from 9/11 (Yes, THAT 9/11) to the [ILWU strike in Hawaii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Longshore_and_Warehouse_Union#The_1934_West_Coast_Waterfront_strike) (Note the date on that one.) to ACORN voter registration fraud (Funny in light of recent developments with the GOP.), to the Weather Underground, through loose connections, out-of-context quotes, and shoddily crafted lines between random things. The director also manages to characterize Michelle Obama as being ""a bitter socialist extremist"" as well. It's basically the 2008 GOP  campaign rehashed, conspiracy style. They even make a few swipes at Hillary Clinton while they're at it.

I see many people complain about these 'purges' being politically motivated, but very few offer suggestions as to what they view a valid/legitimate 'purge' would look like (if it should be allowed at all).  In the interest of maintaining neutral language, let's assume these purges are purely done to remove invalid voter registrations from the voter rolls and not for political reasons.

Presumably, any database such as the voter rolls will, over time, need maintenance.  The rolls can become out of date, with people registered in the wrong locations, perhaps in multiple locations, and (yes) fraud may rarely occur.  The first two examples may not be malicious (paperwork can get lost or forgotten, typos can occur in data entry, etc.), but they would still necessitate (in my mind, at least) a certain amount of maintenance on the voting rolls to remove them.

So my question is: what should a legal/legitimate/non-politically-motivated voter 'purge' look like?  Should voter rolls be purged every election?  Every census?  Should it be mandatory for all voters to 're-register' every X years or have their registration expire?  Or should purges not be allowed at all?",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

Otherwise, ballots are completely anonymous after they’ve been separated from any possible identifying information.

This is in contrary to the United Kingdom which has a unique number assigned to ballots to verify the vote or a person in the event that election fraud is suspected. 

This discussion is relevant to Americans because the Trump campaign is about to launch a [case claiming massive amounts of fraud](https://youtu.be/hqPqPjQFXeQ) with the hope of rejecting votes. If secret ballots had not been used, it would have been extremely easy to verify that election fraud had or had not been committed.  

Though, just because secret ballots are used does not necessarily mean that it is also easy to commit fraud. Ballots have some security features like dollar bills that are supposed to help prevent counterfeit ballots from being created. Elections also have poll watchers from both parties that are able to verify that only senders of ballots have their ballots added to the stack of ballots to be counted. Signatures on absentee ballots are required in most states. And finally, if counterfeit ballots are not created, and poll watchers are not missing fraudulent ballots from being added to the vote total, absentee ballots require an extremely large amount of physical addresses in a way that requires extreme coordination and cost to commit fraud.

What is your opinion on secret ballots? Should they be eliminated in favor of a system more similar to the United Kingdom? Or is the process secure enough to not allow fraud to occur at significant enough levels?

Conservative groups are in favor, saying it will prevent voter fraud.

I will admit I don't really know a whole lot about this. Can anyone help me out by giving me some information about the following specific points?

1. How does it prevent people from voting? In NC, anyone can get a free photo ID at any DMV, and the law doesn't go into effect until 2016. Now, I know that no one likes the DMV, but honestly, as a life-long North Carolinian, I've never had a huge problem with them.

2. Liberal groups typically claim it's a solution to a problem that doesn't exist: voter fraud. I've heard many times that ""there have been practically no instances of voter fraud in the United States."" But this seems a little suspicious. If we don't require ID, how do we know? Have their been reputable studies on this? Frankly, voter fraud just seems so easy, I have a hard time believing it's not happening to some extent.

D'Angelo found it in a place that surely no economist would look, the secret ballot.

>Considered by many to have crushed the first gilded age, the secret ballot was introduced en masse in the US starting in 1890. By 1940 it was everywhere (all citizens and congressmen voted privately). And then for 30 years life was pretty good. Inequality was dropping, so were a number of other metrics, partisanship, campaign finance etc. And then, October 26th, 1970 there was a crack in our air-tight democracy - The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 opened up the votes of Congress (the committee of the whole). Dubbed a ’sunshine law’, this bill has only ever been considered a good thing.

>The trouble is, we vote in secret for a reason. Reasons most Americans forget. Every time votes are public we get massive explosion in two types of electoral fraud. They first form of Electoral Fraud is Vote Buying (Tammany Hall, etc), with as much as 20% of the electorate being paid to vote a specific way (often poor individuals being paid with a chicken wing or a beer). The second form is Voter Intimidation, often times people would vote in the local court house, and they would just announce their vote to the local staff. The trouble with voting publicly (stating your votes to a clerk) is that often citizens were voting on deputies and sheriffs who were sitting right there in the court house, listening. It is hard to vote against an evil Sheriff if he can see how you vote. It is easy to see the problem there.

>Interestingly, this is exactly what now happens in our Congress. Inside of congress, Voter intimidation leads to massive partisanship and polarization, and the vote buying leads to what some congressmen call ‘legalized bribery’. The convictions, admissions and stories of this are common (Jack Abramoff, ABACAM, etc etc). And this change in 1970 has led to a feedback loop that responds to the ever increasing money in Washington. Indeed The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 is the cause for the phenomenal growth of K-street. And all the big firms were born just months after it passed. The trouble is no one has ever called it what it is, Electoral Fraud. And the beauty is, all these alarming trends can be reversed by re-instating the secret ballot.

>NOTE: This summary isn't half as good as the video - full of charts and stats and analysis

It's a really interesting concept, because it seems to have a symmetrical effect on the influence of both corporate interests and voter constituencies on their representatives, by reducing how accountable representatives are to both. I guess the question becomes who the representatives are actually *loyal* to, once interested parties just have to take their word for everything.

Do you think corporate interests would still spend just as much money trying to influence individual congressmen if they had no *reliable* way of confirming that the congressmen did what they wanted? Do you think the effectiveness of those expenditures would be reduced? Is there a middle-way that would asymmetrically effect the influence of corporate interests/constituencies?

For example, I wonder if a middle-way would be to have mostly secret congressional votes, but reveal a random sample of like 2-5% of of each Representative's votes(with a different randomized set revealed for each representative). This (hopefully) keeps the representatives honest, as they never know which votes may be revealed to their constituency, but does it still provide enough obfuscation to neuter corporate bribery?

I think the effect might be asymmetric(which is what we want) because it means that any given corporate interest only has a very small chance of being able to tell how a targeted rep actually voted on the issue they care about, whereas the constituency is informed not by a single vote, but by the voting/ideological trend that the sample reveals.",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

160,Why the US is wrong in the Indian Diplomat case,6.0,1t6q6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1t6q6t/why_the_us_is_wrong_in_the_indian_diplomat_case/,49.0,1387393490.0,"A couple of strong narratives have emerged about the recent Diplomatic spat between US and India. 

The first is that this is a simple law-and-order issue. Devyani Khobragade is alleged to have submitted an employment contract with “materially false and fraudulent statements” to the U.S. State Department. Since her consular privileges only allow for “limited immunity” and she can be arrested for “grave crimes,” the NY Attorney’s office says it did nothing wrong. 

Let’s unpack this argument. For the argument to make sense, what Ms. Khobragade is accused with has to be a “grave crime.”  Let’s read the complaint to see if facts outlined in the complaint constitute a grave crime. 

Ms. Khobragade is charged on two counts – visa fraud and making a false statement to the U.S. Department of State. Since the “visa fraud” count stems directly from the second count, the primary charge against her is the she lied to the U.S. Government. The complaint relies on two pieces of evidence to support the allegation.
* Interviews with the domestic servant and her spouse (identified as Witness-1 and Witness-2), which – to no one’s surprise – substantiate the prosecutors’ claims.
* Two employment contracts with conflicting wage rates. One dated Nov 11, 2012 which identified $9.75 as the hourly wage, another dated Nov 23, 2012 which set the hourly wage at $3.31 per hour.  

The first piece of evidence is basically testimony from an interested party in a civil dispute. This is even less admissible if, as the Indian Government alleges, the complainant was given special privileges in exchange for the testimony. Interestingly, the complaint does not mention any attempt to gather information from the defendant.  

So the U.S. Government’s case rests on a contradicting versions of a civil employment contract. Again, it seems like no attempt was made to contact the defendant to get her side of the story. This is odd for what essentially is a civil contract dispute. Is it unreasonable to expect that the defendant at least get a chance to present her side of the story before being arrested? The more important question is, does the allegation – which by all accounts seem like a civil contract dispute – merit the moniker of a “grave crime”? There are no allegations of mistreatment, abuse or illegal imprisonment in this complaint. 

The second, is that the whole brouhaha is just a cultural misunderstanding. That unlike in India, where the elite and “high-caste” people get preferential treatment, the U.S. is a nation of laws. This is just not a serious argument. No one is arguing that any particular Indian citizen in the U.S. be given preferential statement.  The argument is that Ms. Khobragade as a representative of the Indian Government to the U.S. deserves the same protections that U.S. consular personnel expect in India and other countries. Does the U.S. Government really want to go down this path where actions of their embassy staff around the world are scrutinized and the book is thrown at them for every perceived violation of local laws? 

The overlooked angle to this scandal is ineptness of the current U.S. administration in dealing with foreign policy issues. From the NSA snooping scandal which has sowed the seeds of distrust among western allies like Germany, to diverting the place of Bolivian President Eva Morales which caused an uproar in Latin America, and now this latest spat with India. It’s almost as if U.S. diplomacy has been hijacked by nameless, mid-level bureaucrats from various Government departments.

But this race is different due to how close it is in so many states. We have time to recount a few times before the official electors cast their votes in December. After that the president has been elected. 

But, an investigation into voter fraud can take months. And what if it was identified that there were a few thousand cases of fraud that would’ve been enough to change the outcome in one state or another so that the total electorates would’ve shifted enough to change the outcome. What would happen if we identified that technically the wrong president was elected?

Note: voter fraud could be as simple as a ballot auto-mailed to a deceased family member yet another person filled it out and sent it in. Let’s not talk about “proof” or “historically”. This is an absolutely unique election year. COVID forced more people to choose mail-in ballots making a person’s vote susceptible to coercion (think of an abusive spouse) and states that auto-mailed ballots without request made errors (think deceased or person living elsewhere). Combine that with the most politically charged environment imaginable and it’s not far fetched to see how small scale voter fraud could occur. But this time around that small scale could’ve been enough.

If you have seen the South Park episode about Scientology and have skimmed some of the very popular recent articles about it, there probably won't be anything new to you so I wouldn't worry too much about spoilers.

Of course there are lots of negative allegations against the practices and culture of Scientology. There are the allegations that they are a multi-faceted fraud, first taking naive innocent peoples' money in exchange for a sense of belonging or purpose, and then blackmailing them if they stop being so enthusiastic about donating further, and then not paying taxes on the proceeds under fraudulent pretenses that they provide a public good and therefore should be tax-exempt as a charity. There are the allegations that they use essentially slave labor and strict application of physical punishment when those mostly-unpaid staff-members ""misbehave"". There are the allegations that they force their adherents to completely shun people who are viewed as antagonistic to the church, even if those people are close family members. There are allegations that their foundational theology is science-fiction garbage that clearly traces its origins back to stuff L Ron Hubbard first started writing about in his pulp science fiction novels. And a few others.

What struck me about all this, and maybe I am desensitized because I was expecting to have some bombs dropped in this new documentary and yet everything seemed to have been previously covered in South Park or in previous journalistic exposés, is that *none of it seemed that unfamiliar from the major organized religions*. I honestly could not think of a single substantial difference between the allegations against Scientology and allegations I can think of against one or more of the largest religions.

But then in 1997, Elections Canada set up the National Register of Electors.  The data therein comes from four main sources:

1. When you file your taxes, there's a tickybox on the form that says ""Do you want your information stored/updated in the National Register of Electors?""  If you tick it, your name and address are sent to the National Register, updating it as required.  Also, if someone has turned 18 and isn't yet on the register, and ticks the box, their information will be sent to Elections Canada for inclusion.
2. Provincial and territorial motor vehicles departments.  When you get a driver's licence or renew your licence or get an address change on your licence, you again can tick a similar tickybox.  If so, then the name and address information (as well as whether you've just turned 18) is sent to Elections Canada.
3. Citizenship and Immigration Canada.  If someone becomes a new Canadian citizen, they are also asked if they want their information sent to the National Register, and if they do, off it goes so they can be added to the list.
4. Provincial and territorial vital statistics deparments.  They send over lists of deaths, so that those people can be removed from the National Register.

170,TL;DR of Obama's budget plan,2.0,10y0kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/10y0kf/tldr_of_obamas_budget_plan/,0.0,1349370648.0,"**Disclaimer- this is not complete!**  Obama’s plan is SIGNIFICANTLY longer (200+ pages) than Romney's, and I’ve covered the issues that appear to be the most important to people (a la redditor [hurrayforzac](http://www.reddit.com/user/hurrayforzac), who covered Romney’s plan).  I am also an amateur at political science and have injected a few of my own opinions in here, so I strongly urge you to read through these budgets and make your own decisions!  Hopefully this makes it a little easier, though.

Main ideas:

* Cutting spending on non-essential govt programs, including some that the administration states “will take not only eliminating ineffective and duplicative programs, but also cutting worthy programs that the Administration would otherwise fund were it not for the tight fiscal environment.”
* Examples: eliminating federal EPA programs (such as clean water and asbestos-removal initiatives) and allowing states to take these over.  The justification is that the programs have been in place so long, the individual states are basically running them anyway.
* Elimination of spending for indirect expenses in health care and health care training, i.e. covering the cost of tuition during medical students’ in-hospital training, but not compensating the individual hospitals for decreased/slower services due to needing to train the students.
* Cutting private-sector incentives (like Clean Automotive Technology) and allowing similar govt programs to take over the research (there is a Vehicles Technology program already in place).
* Cuts to non-clean energies such as coal, fossil energy R&D, and lots of cuts to agriculture since this sector is considered “strong” despite the bad economy.
* Sadly, cuts to several technology and science programs, but this was considered justified in that many of the goals of these programs had been met.
* Happily, TONS of cuts to military spending.  This may not sit well w/ a lot of people, but the cuts that are proposed are things such as decreasing the physical size of the military (less soldiers which is inevitable anyway with pulling out of Afghanistan), decreasing training of deputized and armed pilots on commercial aircraft, cutting funding for drones not currently in high production, and crazy experimental weapons.
* Elimination of funding for the National Drug Intelligence Center (first step toward legalizing recreational drugs!).
* Cuts to highly-specific federal assistance programs (to be consolidated), which I’m sure my right-leaning readers are excited about.  This includes decreased spending on govt-subsidised housing for the disabled.
* Govt will no longer take over defaulted student loans.  This will instead be the responsibility of the guaranty agency (Fannie Mae, etc), decreasing fines.


The plan also outlines (with many helpful charts) consolidation of several loose and duplicate programs to reduce overall spending.  This includes federal highway programs, immigration departments, higher education funding, and of course healthcare reform.

* The Federal Highways Program will take 55 individual categories and consolidate into 5 new programs: National Highway (budgeting/upkeep), Safety, Livability (pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly), Research, Technology & Education, and Federal Allocation (emergency relief and special considerations).
*Integrated Resource Restoration: decommissioning of over 2,000 miles of roads, the restoration or enhancement of 2,750 miles of stream habitat, and 2,800 million board feet of timber sold.
* Implementation of the First in the World Program (FITW) to create a more competitive education environment and consolidate special ed programs.
* Decreasing the number of regional offices for the Department of Labor.
* Streamlining the Department of Homeland Security because it’s a fucking mess.
* No more staying in school forever to prevent interest from accruing as interest will start to accrue if students don’t complete their program within 150% the allotted time (in other words, if you are in a 4-year program, and it takes you over 6 years, you’re going to start paying interest while still in school).


The savings proposed will come from several areas:

* Focuses on reducing waste by improving use of technology (i.e. less paper used and more electronically formatted forms that will be available through govt websites), and decreasing spending on silly things such as “extraneous promotional items” such as plaques for fancy offices.
* Program integrity:  making sure people fuck up less often.  This has made it a lot more difficult for people to commit Medicare fraud as the consequences have become more severe (believe me, I’ve had to sit through a HIPAA presentation every year for the last 3 years!).
* Emphasis on reducing health-care costs by reducing the number of uninsured who get “free” healthcare at the expense of the states.  By implementing “Obamacare” a.k.a. the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, many govt-funded health programs become obsolete and funding is reallocated to cover those who are exempt from the actual “buying” of insurance.

My name is **Removed**. I am a veteran of the Iraq War and currently a college student. Recently you voted “no” to the Amash Amendment to de-fund the NSA’s current data collection program and to rescind article 215 of the Patriot Act. I am sorely disappointed in your decision to abandon the privacy rights of not just the constituents of your district, but all Americans nationwide. Privacy is a chief attribute to freedom, and one’s assurance that the things they do on a daily basis aren’t being arbitrarily monitored for future use is paramount to free society and the ability of the people to hold their government accountable. If we must live in a society where our decisions on whether or not to voice our opinion on aspects of government regulation are based upon whether or not we might have done things in the past that could potentially embarrass or hurt our image or the image of those around us, the we are not living in a free society. This is what you have voted for by derailing potential legislation that would maintain the privacy of American citizens. 
	Please, do not misunderstand my love for this country. If there is a threat to the sovereign borders of this great nation, then by all means steps should be taken to protect them. Acting on the possibility of future threat however is not a way to run the surveillance program of the United States. Verifiable and tangible evidence must be secured prior to any actions that may cause the potential loss of life are taken. Storing data of millions of Americans for future use just because someone, somewhere, may be a potential threat is absurd. This represent the actions of the former Soviet Union at the height of its power, not the representative democracy of the United States. There very well may be someone down the street from me plotting to rob a bank, murder their wife, or commit fraud on their tax returns – but until the act is committed no action can be taken (unless verifiable proof of intent is established). 

Yes, I do think that organizations like the NSA are a valuable asset to this nation and its citizens. I will not stand for the arbitrary collection of data however, in an attempt to further the nation’s security. A famous statesman once said, “Those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither”. I hope you take these words to heart and understand that broad strokes of surveillance by clandestine organizations, who are accountable to none is not the mark of a free country. I will be watching with cautious optimism in the hopes that you will take these words and show me and many others like me that there still is a glimmer of hope within the walls of congress. 

You are a representative of the people. That means that regardless of your own views, your responsibility is to represent the wishes of your own constituents. Unless your constituents are calling for the mass murder of people, I think you would be wise to listen to their voices. We are, after all, the ones who put you in the place you are today. 

My vote depends on your actions,

The purpose of these things is to make fraud much easier to detect by the voters themselves, rather than leaving it solely in the hands of election officials while maintaining the principles behind the secret ballot.  Paper can certainly be added for additional security if desired.

These steps can all be independent, and I'll save the most interesting one for last.

1.  Open source software on all machines.  This is talked about elsewhere, so I won't go into detail.  It's easy to do and there's no reason not to.

2.  Tally Display - Display a tally at the polls of total ballots counted.  The final tally for each polling place should be posted online.  This makes it more difficult (but not impossible) to add votes.  Locals would notice a large sudden jump in the tally.  People at the end of the line would likely stick around to see the final tally.  False votes would have to be added one at a time over a larger period of time.  This should be significantly more difficult than simply adding a clump of false ballots at the end.

3.  Verification with Plausible Deniability - This one is a bit complicated to describe, but the process itself is much simpler than it sounds.  Please read it in full and consider all of it.  After completing a ballot, two options are available.  Print a receipt with an anonymous vote ID and your true ballot choices, or create a ""false"" ""anti-coercion"" receipt where you can create any ballot receipt you choose.  The details and tally of all printed receipts should be shown online along with the only the tally of all true receipts and the percentage of false receipts requested.  These receipts should not be printed on paper, only displayed as a vote ID on the screen which you have an option of writing down with good old fashioned pencil and paper or memorizing.

In reality, the percentage of ""false"" receipts should be low to nearly non-existent, allowing people to essentially take the results into excel on their own and count the votes themselves plus or minus a small margin of error.

In regards to tone, content and goal of the messaging used by the far right during the Obama presidency, is it really that different from what was being said by radical liberals about Bush and Cheney?

The far left wanted to Impeach Bush, and introduced house bills claiming similar breaches of the constitution, election fraud, NSA Surveillance Overstepping (Irony?) etc. Is one era's Ted Cruz another era's Dennis Kucinich?

There is a lot of talk about how batshit crazy the Tea Party is, and how they should just respect that Obama was fairly re-elected, and that ACA is a law, etc., but is it really that much different from radicals from the other side? The Tea Party may just be louder (possibly due to the rapid growth of social media and its adoption by tradition media outlets, lower barrier of entry to self publishing online, etc.) and better funded than the radical left in the Bush years.

**How can we create a society where Civil Rights and Property Rights exist if there are no actual specific Laws describing exactly what these Rights are, and no institution of Police or ""enforcers"" to make sure these Rights are properly respected?**

In my search for the best and most realistic path to achieving both of these worthy goals, I have (at least temporarily) settled on describing myself as a [Minarchist Libertarian](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minarchism). For those who want the TL; DR, the following is from the link...

*""Minarchism (also known as minimal statism) is a political philosophy. It is variously defined by sources. In the strictest sense, it holds that states ought to exist (as opposed to anarchy), that their only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, breach of contract, and fraud, and that the only legitimate governmental institutions are the military, police, and courts. In the broadest sense, it also includes fire departments, prisons, the executive, and legislatures as legitimate government functions. Such states are generally called night-watchman states.*

*""Minarchists argue that the state has no authority to use its monopoly of force to interfere with free transactions between people, and see the state's sole responsibility as ensuring that contracts between private individuals and property are protected, through a system of law courts and enforcement. Minarchists generally believe a laissez-faire approach to the economy is most likely to lead to economic prosperity.""*

My argument would be that it is virtually impossible to actually ensure Civil Rights and Property Rights (however those may be specifically defined) without some uniform system of Law and Police that acts to guarantee these boundaries are enforced. 

Are there any truly possible practical alternatives (not just theoretical or idealogical principles, but real workable methods to acheive these goals)?

187,Rick Perry Chain Letter,2.0,jx1tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/jx1tx/rick_perry_chain_letter/,9.0,1314546559.0,"Hey guys, I was forwarded an e-mail regarding Rick Perry and while it's obviously meant to be in his favor, I was wondering if anyone else had run into this before.  Of the information listed, what of this is actually true, and does anyone have a link to anything disputing this? 

Email copied here:

Who Is Rick Perry?
He is a fifth generation Texan, the son of hardscrabble west Texas tenant farmers – Democrats but conservatives through and through. He grew up in a farm town too small to be on the state map. Life was so hard that he was six years old before his house had indoor plumbing. His mother sewed his clothes, including the underwear he wore to college.

He is an Eagle Scout. After Paint Creek High School, he attended Texas A&M, graduated, and was commissioned into the Air Force where he became a C-130 pilot.

Now 61 years old, he has won nine elections to four different offices in Texas state government. In the first three elections he ran as a Democrat then switched to the Republican Party. He is currently the 47th governor of Texas – a position he has held for 11 years, the longest tenure of any governor in the nation.

He has never lost an election.

Rick Perry was the Lieutenant Governor to whom Governor George Bush handed over the office after winning the 2000 Presidential election. Since then, Perry won gubernatorial elections in 2002, 2004, and 2010, the last time by 55% against a field consisting of a Democrat, a Libertarian, a Green Party, and an Independent.

Since he became its Governor, Texas – a right to work state that taxes neither personal income nor capital gains – has added more jobs than the other 49 states combined. In the last two years, low taxes and little regulation led his state to create 47% of all jobs created in the entire nation. Five of the top ten cities with the highest job growth in the nation are in Texas . People follow jobs, so in the last four years for which data are available, Texas led every state in net interstate migration growth.

Perry signed ground-breaking “loser pays” tort reform and medical litigation rules that caused malpractice insurance rates to fall. Some 20,000 doctors have since moved to Texas .

Texas boasts 58 of the Fortune 500 companies – more than any other state. Since May 2011 Texas resumed its pre-recession employment levels. Only two other states and the District of Columbia have done that.

Texas ships 16% of the nation’s export value. California trails at 11%. Of the 70 companies that have fled California so far in 2011, 14 relocated in Texas .

In this year’s Texas legislative season, Perry got most of what he wanted. With no new taxes, a fiscally lean state budget was passed leaving $6 billion in a rainy day fund even as other states around the country struggled to balance budgets and avoid more deficit borrowing. A voter ID bill passed that was designed to prevent ballot box fraud and illegal voting. A bill passed that makes plaintiffs pay court costs and attorney fees if their suits are deemed frivolous.

Perry scored points even in his legislative failures. He failed to get sanctuary cities banned – Texas towns in which police cannot question detainees about their immigration status. The blame fell on the legislature. Perry also failed to get a so-called “anti-groping” bill passed that would put Transportation Security Administration agents in prison if they touch the genitals, anus, or breasts of passengers in a pat down. Federal officials threatened to halt all flights out of Texas airports and the bill died in special session. That endeared Texans even more to TSA employees living in Texas .

Perry jogs daily in the morning. He has no bodyguard with him, but his daughter’s dog runs by his side and he carries a laser-guided automatic pistol in his belt. Last year while jogging in an undeveloped area, a coyote paralleled his jogging route, eyeing his dog. He drew his pistol and killed the animal with one shot, leaving it where it fell. “He became mulch,"" Perry said. Animal rights groups protested, but Perry shrugged it off. “Don’t come after my dog,” he warned them.

Recently, Obama asked Perry to delay the July 7 execution of Humberto Leal in order to comply with the International Court of Justice in The Hague and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Perry refused. Therefore Obama asked the US Supreme Court to delay the execution because it would damage US foreign relations. The Court refused 5-4 and Perry ordered the execution to go forward as scheduled. Over the howls of diplomats, politicians, and the UN, Leal was administered a lethal injection at 6:20 p.m. Before he died, he admitted his guilt and asked for forgiveness.

The case has special implications for Perry, who is considering a run for the presidency in 2012. Even his critics resent federal interference in a Texas execution, which is related to a state, not a federal, crime – an alcohol and drug-fueled rape and murder 17 years ago by an illegal whose family brought him into the country 35 years ago as a child. The interference hinges not on the man’s guilt, which Leal’s advocates acknowledged, but on a technicality – failure to inform Leal that he could have gotten legal representation from the Mexican consulate in lieu of the court-appointed attorneys who represented him. Independent Texans saw Obama’s interference as another intrusion of federal power into the affairs of a state, which could cost Obama support in other states.

Needless to say, Perry is a hard-edged conservative and a ferocious defender of 10th Amendments rights (“The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”) – an explicit restriction of the federal government to only those powers granted in the Constitution. Perry accuses the federal government, especially the Obama administration, of illegal overreach.

Perry said “no thanks” to the feds whose stimulus offered taxpayer dollars for education and unemployment assistance. The strings on “free money” from Washington , he said, would restrict Texas in managing its own affairs. Perry even depleted all state funds to fight recent wildfires before asking Washington for disaster relief. His request has been ignored, which comes across as an unvarnished federal power play, further pitting Perry and Texans against the federal government.",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

In the spirit of the party, I submit it to the internet. Any and all suggestions welcome.

**Your Choice Party - Guidelines 12/3/2012 2:49PM**

A Representative of this party may not make any decisions in relation to his role in office without a vote from the people. A vote constitutes 50% participation or higher of the current population. A reference number can be figured by using the most recently taken census figures. If the participation number is under 50%, the Representative can vote however he chooses. Including taking the side of the people who did vote. The Citizens choose for themselves. They can also choose to kick the candidate out of the party much easier than other political parties. If more than 50% of citizens vote the Representative in, more than 50% of citizens have to vote you out.

The Citizen can vote on every issue that the representative is able to vote on. There is no need to try and figure out how a Representative will vote. He only votes the way the citizens say he should vote. The best choice for a Representative would then be someone that is able to assist the voters with political information in the best fashion. It is daunting trying to get everyone to vote on everything, let alone asking them to research every bill! The goal will be to make the voting process as efficient and accessible as possible. Voting identity will be kept private by default.

The office of the Representative will be devoted to disseminating and collecting information while also condensing it into layman terms. Developing a secure method of collecting votes is our primary concern. Digital (via online interaction) and Physical (via mail-in votes). Authentication of the citizenship will be necessary to restrict voter fraud. Initial physical verification and proof of residence will be necessary for all forms of access to vote. Ideas include IP address locking (digital), multi-level online verification (digital) and verified postal mail (physical). The opportunity for local voting booths in libraries or other township buildings is great.

Citizen participation will not only be welcomed, it will be the way of life. If a Citizen raises an issue with at least a 50% vote in its favor, I will introduce legislation for it. The Citizens will be welcomed to help write it. However, NO Legislation can be introduced without the Citizens consent. The previous rule of a Representative decision if less than 50% participation can not be applied. Forums and meetings will be scheduled to allow direct interaction. An internet forum will be the easiest, quickest and most direct means to discuss and vote on the issues at hand.

Monetary contributions to the Representative, beyond official pay, which is decided by the constituents, are illegal and NOT welcome. The Representatives' tax returns are of official public record. Evidence of one infraction is enough reason to initiate impeachment. Citizens can initiate impeachment with a 50% or higher vote including proof of accusation. Accepting non-monetary gifts of any kind, even from private citizens, must be reported and made public record.

**Examples of impeachment include:**

- Introducing legislation without citizen consent.
- Not voting with 50%+ citizen consensus.
- Accepting monetary contributions of any kind from any and all donors.
- Failure to make tax returns or gift record public.

If you are interested in participating in building the foundation of the Your Choice Party please feel free to share any and all ideas including reworking of existing language, lengthening of existing language (specifics of particular processes) and new language.

**Issues to consider:**

- Should the required vote participation be 60%? 40%? Is 50% reasonable?
- What is the best way to setup a secure online voting system?
- What is the best way to prevent voter fraud in this system?
- Vote weekly for mail-in constituents? Who bears the cost of postage?
- Can the mail-in system revive the United States Postal Service?
- How should a list of all eligible voters be kept?
- What's the best way to edit and share these guidelines openly with the internet community?
- Should there be a group of citizens assigned to oversee the Representatives' office?
- What are your issues with the system?
- What needs to be done to make this a reality?

The **Your Choice Party** is looking to revise and hone this idea with the goal of running a candidate for local office. Coinciding with the principles of the party, our natural impulse will be to eliminate outside money from the election process. If the public decides everything, then elections must be locally funded. This is the biggest detriment facing the people having a true, equal say in government. By the people, For the people must be the law of the land once again. Current technology allows us to make this happen.

Thank you for your time,

David Brooks (not the NY Times columnist)

190,Alternative Tax Policy Proposal,2.0,l78gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/l78gx/alternative_tax_policy_proposal/,8.0,1318266557.0,"So I have an idea I'd like to hear opinions and critiques of that goes a little something like this:  Create a new class of investment fund that can only invest in ""public good"" for-profit companies, triple-bottom-line companies that are ""not just for profit"" and have written into their corporate DNA that the board and executives are required to do good while pursuing profit.  There are a number of certifications and structures aimed at this definition already and I am not a lawyer, but B Corporation and L3C are the kind of thing I mean.

Then create a prototype investment fund adhering to this policy, and perhaps some other more specific policies, e.g. 50% employee owned, certain business categories can be excluded and/or encouraged based on goals and issues... maybe some formal process or algorithm to quantify public good independently can be a big part of the decision whether to fund a particular investment.

Now, many Republicans are obsessed with investors, with the idea of ""not penalizing the job creators"" etc with more taxes... So let's let's say for people earning over 250K there's a new law saying they have a choice of either paying however much higher taxes on that part of income or of investing in this class of investment fund that is for profit and seeks profit for investors, but not exclusively, and anyone who adheres to the policies and regulation can create such a fund to compete for the wealthy's ""mandatory investment"" dollars.

There's a lot of details in the air and a lot of sources of potential fraud/abuse to try and address, but what do people think of the general idea?  

I'm also interested in getting reactions to a tangentially related idea of mine that so far no one's weighed in on over at http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalprocess (or more specifically the only current thread: http://redd.it/k1tk1) which attempts to address political process reform rather than policy reform, in a way that should theoretically limit partisan bickering since the idea is the changes shouldn't benefit either party but only streamline and improve the process in favor of the people and in favor of ideas and actions being more important than people or politics.

191,Here's your 'Sputnik moment.',2.0,j683c,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/j683c/heres_your_sputnik_moment/,2.0,1312247016.0,"Months ago, I heard Obama's State of the Union address, where he tried to coin a phrase that would become part of his legacy. He said this tenuous time in America's history is our generation's 'Sputnik moment.'

I'm not much of a history buff, but this idea of a 'Sputnik moment' comes from the late 50s/early 60s when, as a result of our own decadence, Russia beat us into space. At that point, Eisenhower declared the 'Sputnik crisis', and NASA was founded. in May of 1961, Kennedy declared that in 10 years' time, we would put a man on the moon.

Sounded crazy at the time, but *we fucking did it.* You know why? Because we made it a goddamn priority, and because when we want to, we get shit done here. Matter of fact, we did it 2 years ahead of schedule.

/history lesson

Obama used this 'Sputnik moment' line to set short-term goals for green technology, research, and development in America, which I think is certainly something the country needs to focus on, but I think it goes deeper than that, and I think there's a more ambitious, yet elegant solution to most of our nation's problems. So here's what the 'Sputnik moment' should have been:

Just like in 1957, we find ourselves being outpaced by other countries in a number of areas, but one that gets reasonable attention (I'll argue not enough) is education. It's no secret that America is slipping fast when it comes to education. Countries throughout Asia and Europe are turning out more educated citizens, and we're fast on our way out the door as an intellectual superpower.

So let's use this moment. Let's set our minds on something and *get it done, because that's what we do.* Here goes:

**Put every American through college in 10 years.**

Think about it. We can solve almost all of our problems through education. Citizens who are better educated lead to more educated voters, which leads to better representatives in government. Better educated citizens means more savvy consumers, which hurts con artists like Madoff, the people responsible for the housing bubble, and those assholes on Wall Street. Better educated voters are also more inclined to think for themselves and less apt to get wrapped up in ideological rhetoric. Better educated citizens leads to more savvy consumers of news media, again more likely to think for themselves, which hurts people like O'Reilly, Olbermann, and Beck. I can really go on and on with the possible positive outcomes.

Now, before you start ripping me up in the comments section for missing some things, let me get a few out of the way, and whatever I'm forgetting, have at it:

*What about children?* -This would only apply to adults, 18 and up.

*Old folks?* -There would be an age limit as well. Say 50.

*What if people are happy where they're at?* -I wouldn't want it mandated, so there would be an opportunity to 'opt out.'

*Yeah, and how the hell would we afford this?* -(Here's where my opinion comes into play) Cut the military in half. End the wars. Put the armed forces back on **defense,** rather than **offense.** Also, eliminate fraud in all the entitlement programs (I know, easier said than done.)

I'm sure I missed plenty, so feel free to tear me up in the comments.

All in all, though, I think this can be done. Hate to use the old phrase, but *""If they can put a man on the moon...""* 

**TL;DR - We should blow up the moon and replace it with a Death Star named Sputnik II and threaten to blow up Russia, demanding enough ransom money to pay off the national debt. --- Just read it or leave.**",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

1) The obvious leave it where it is 

2) my proposal: people start their own health care system

Explanation: As a kid my family joined a communal health care sharing program. The bill was about 1/3 of a comparable plan. 

How it works: You pay for your (and your families) regular checkups/emergency room visits. If a emergency room/hospital visit becomes more then you can afford, the you send a request to the organization for other members to pay your bill. The then process it  (takes a week or two)- to make sure you are not a fraud - while you pay out of pocket. Then they get other members to write you a check (not the organization) and send it to you in the mail to pay off your bills.

I think that if people set up 2-3 of these organizations per major city (so around 100 of them total), where anyone from anywhere can join. We could easily pay for people's medical bills while eliminating corporate greed and/or government corruption.",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud
193,How to fix American elections,1.0,1p7bvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1p7bvq/how_to_fix_american_elections/,5.0,1382719875.0,"The electoral process in the United States is inherently flawed.  I think I'd most like to see us transition to proportional representation, but that'd be a radical change that I just can't see happening.  We can keep the current structure of the federal government intact, however, while reforming the electoral mechanisms to produce a much more accurate representation of the American people, while diminishing the influence of money and established political power.

First off, I just can't believe that some form of online voting is impossible. Even if the federal government had to lay down a whole new  physical network just for that, it'd be worth it, and I doubt that'd be the case.  Going forward into the 21st century, requiring physical travel, waiting in line, and paper ballots is just ridiculously inefficient.  So long as each voting citizen has a unique key and receives some sort of verifiable receipt for their vote, fraud shouldn't be an issue; after the election, the exact results could be made public (without actual names tied to votes, of course), and individual voters could check to make sure that their vote was counted.  I suppose the healthcare.gov thing is an argument against this, but hopefully it will be a teaching mistake that can set the stage for voting.gov.

If such a system were put in place, the stage would be set for major reform. 

Several amendments need to be passed:

1) Ranked voting for all federal elections.  The first-past-the-post system is laughably antiquated.  Does any developed nation besides us and the UK use it?  For those who don't know, a ranked voting system would mean that you cast a ballot featuring your #1 choice, and if you so choose, #2 and #3 and so forth.  All of the #1 choices are counted, and if there is not a majority winner, the candidate with the least number of votes is thrown out.  All of the ballots for that candidate then have their #2 choices counted.  If there's still no majority, repeat.  This would allow people to vote for third-party candidates without worrying about the spoiler effect.  It's not a perfect system, but it's loads better than our current one.

2) Require all federal elections, including primaries, to utilize the voting.gov. Compulsory voting enforced with a small fine for all federal elections, along with a ""none-of-the-above"" choice which would require a new election if it received a majority. Extend voting over a period of a few days. Physical polling sites would still be around for those who don't have internet access.

3) Public financing of all federal campaigns. Have a sign-up deadline and require a signature threshold and a non-token, but not prohibitive, application fee, and have automatic audits in the next year for those receiving public funds. Maybe restrict repeat participation without a good faith showing of legitimate effort and a minimum percentage of votes. Private funds could still be spent on a campaign, but all donors would have to be fully disclosed, and half of any such contributions would be charged to the public campaign fund. The amount of disbursements would be calculated each election cycle, based on the previous election's average spending, amounts received, (the non-voting fee revenues, along with the private contributions, and probably some other tax) and number of participating candidates.

4) A non-partisan body to draw objectively-defined districts every 10 years. Other countries manage this, and the judicial system could handle allegations of unfairness using benchmarks of equal distribution of geographic area, population, and existing communities.  Having gerrymandering built into our system is just ridiculous, it's like we're not even pretending that elections are supposed to be fair representations.

5) Abolish the Electoral College, making the Presidency based purely on the popular vote.  The idea that the Executive branch represents the states and not the people is outdated.  With the increased homogenization of political belief relative to location due to mass media and the internet, all the College does is weigh the votes of people in rural states more heavily than those in densely-populated states.  

We would need some statutes to lay out the specifics of the execution of the districting entity, the public campaign financing, and the voting website. Throw in some laws restricting lobbying by former legislators and an end to felon disenfranchisement and we'd have at least the low-hanging fruit of political corruption and misrepresentation beat.

The states would be welcome to adopt these rules and use voting.gov, but not mandated to.",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

197,The Blowback on Ex-Goldman Exec Greg Smith |  FDL News Desk / policy implications for Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform / Bartlett Naylor,1.0,qzimh,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/qzimh/the_blowback_on_exgoldman_exec_greg_smith_fdl/,0.0,1331913864.0,"It was only a matter of time before Goldman Sachs would start to smear their former employee, Greg Smith, who published his resignation letter in a celebrated op-ed in the New York Times. At first they merely denied the change in culture that Smith stressed, one from nurturing a relationship with their clients to field-stripping their clients for as much money as they could get. But now they’re bringing out the big guns.

    A Goldman official confirmed that Mr. Smith, who worked for the Wall Street firm for nearly 12 years, most recently in London, resigned from Goldman this morning [...]

    Mr. Smith described himself as an executive director and head of Goldman’s U.S. equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

    A person familiar with the matter said Mr. Smith’s role is actually vice president, a relatively junior position held by thousands of Goldman employees around the world. And Mr. Smith is the only employee in the derivatives business that he heads, this person said.

So he only had a fake title, is the claim. He wasn’t in a position to know anything. He was isolated over there in London.

Forbes chalked it up to a midlife crisis. Other employees blabbed to Charlie Gasparino that Smith was a small-timer, never making more than $750,000 a year. And the financial press on cable TV went on an all-out attack.

This sounds like a last gasp to me. Matt Taibbi’s excellent piece makes the point that Wall Street was always going to have to reform itself, when the clients stood up for themselves rather than continually handing over money to firms committed to ripping them off. If Goldman wants to shift from a client relations firm to a trading firm, fine. But clients should know that, and they should direct their money accordingly. I don’t know if we’re even at the point now where reputational risk can sink a Wall Street firm, but this is the best shot:

    These guys have lost the fear of going out of business, because they can’t go out of business. After all, our government won’t let them. Beyond the bailouts, they’re all subsisting daily on massive loads of free cash from the Fed. No one can touch them, and sadly, most of the biggest institutional clients see getting clipped for a few points by Goldman or Chase as the cost of doing business.

    The only way to break this cycle, since our government doesn’t seem to want to end its habit of financially supporting fraud-committing, repeat-offending, client-fleecing banks, is for these big “muppet” clients to start taking their business elsewhere.

The blowback, in my view, is a glancing blow that reinforces the fact that Smith has a real point here. The question is whether the investors will recognize this as well.

…from a policy standpoint, Bartlett Naylor of Public Citizen ties Smith’s op-ed to the Volcker rule:

    Explosive revelations today from an outgoing Goldman Sachs executive emphasize the need for Wall Street agencies to finalize the Volcker Rule reform, which would prevent many significant conflicts of interest in the financial industry [...]

    The Volcker Rule, approved as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, prohibits banks from engaging in trades for their own profits and strictly bars trading that conflicts with customers’ interests. But a barrage of self-serving industry comments have led regulators to signal they will delay implementation beyond the statutory deadline of July 2012. Goldman Sachs submitted two comment letters and met with regulators personally an unprecedented six times. Regulators should put Smith’s candid and brave words on the top of any analysis about how best to reform Wall Street and weigh them when considering the motivations behind Goldman’s official comments and meetings.

After all, Smith’s op-ed, at the root, describes massive conflicts of interests between Goldman and its clients.

My answer to this was simply - maybe no Democrats got caught committing voter fraud in this election cycle?

I am in support for some amount of social welfare and he's staunchly against any social welfare. His arguments are:

1. Everyone who's on welfare is fraud and lazy bum

2. Wealth re-distribution is theft and that public fund is taxpayer's money

3. People should not be forced to share the costs of others (i.e. medical disability)

My counter arguments were:

1. Not everyone who uses welfare does that permanently and it's a good safety net for legitimate taxpayers who may occasionally fall on hard times.

2. Wealth redistribution is an investment to increase the overall productivity of the society

3. Public funds is the government's money and it is entitled to do whatever it wants with it as long as it follows the law (and obviously, it should benefit the society). So obviously, it's not the taxpayer's money anymore, at least not legally.

I guess this is really a clash between individualism and collectivism. Despite the heavy influence of the Christian faith on Republicans, I can't seem to shrug off the notion that their stigma against collectivism and socialist ideals as being selfish and contrary to the teachings of their lovely bible.

I've been reading a lot of fear about voter fraud in Ohio on many sites and it's obviously something we can't take for granted. Jon Husted is a corrupt individual who explicitly tried to rule on voting hours strictly by party lines: extending it for Republican areas and restricting it for Democratic ones.

In 2004, [Bush won Ohio by 118,775 votes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Ohio,_2004). In 2008, [Obama won Ohio by 262,224 votes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Ohio,_2008). Let's PRETEND that the election was stolen from Kerry in Ohio in 2004, although I have seen little to no credible evidence that this was true. My memory was the polls had Kerry down before the election and in exit polling after. But, for the sake of argument, say he was cheated out of 120,000 votes. [Nate Silver projects Obama to win by 3% points](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/). That's ~ 168,000 votes. Ohio would have to be cheated 40% better than it was in 2004. I have to think it's harder to cheat as you go forward, not easier. That's how much cheating Ohio would have to do in an election where everyone is watching. We all know Obama is winning in Ohio in the polls. And, we'll all have a close eye on the exit polling if there is any. [A woman in Nevada was hauled to jail by FBI agents for just trying to vote twice](http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/nov/02/southern-nevada-woman-arrested-suspicion-trying-vo/). That should make most people think twice before trying anything on Tuesday.

So, while we should all have our guard up and be vigilant if we see or hear about any wrong doing, we should also keep our heads and realize that it is not easy to rig an election - someone has to have the will, knowledge, opportunity, the correct execution in a CREDIBLE way, likely work in a team where everyone can keep a secret, cheat the RIGHT number, and NOT get caught. The perpetrators would have to cheat ~ 168,000 votes - about the size of everyone living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I have to believe that's not easy.

And, hey, the good news is that even IF Ohio falls to Romney legitimately or not, [Obama has a credible pathway to 270 if he can just win either Colorado or Virginia](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/custom-presidential-election-map#nlamdnjannabjense) which Nate has [Obama winning in BOTH](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/). Either way, VOTE! Because every vote we're up in Ohio makes it that much tougher to cheat. :)

**TLDR - There's been no evidence that Ohio was cheated in 2004. Even if there was cheating in 2004, it will be harder in 2012 because Obama has a larger lead and it's harder to cheat as we go forward, not easier.

If similar thing happened in the general election under a GOP government, this same establishment Democrats would be fuming and crying election fraud. Now, the thing is, GOP is watching this unfold and taking notes, so isn't this a shot in the foot? Isn't the DNC teaching GOP that they can manage elections ""creatively"" to their advantage?

Not talking about exactly the same type of fraud of course, as a delay and selective release of information in the general doesn't impact the end results, but fraud in a sense ""if we just do this unusual thing it will benefit out guy and let's do it, Dems can't do shit about it"".

I personally believe there are only 3 real ""tossup"" states: Virginia, Florida, and Colorado.

Obama **should** also definitely win Ohio, but I'm reading so many alleged election fraud threads, that I'm gunshy to call it a tossup or solid Obama.

At any rate, if Virginia and New Hampshire, go for Obama early in the night, that could set-up an early Obama victory **IF** there are no other upsets.

It seems a trustworthy voting system should have these attributes:

1) anonymity: no one can see your vote

2) verifiability: you can, if you choose, verify that your vote is correctly counted in the total

3) incorruptibility: you can't be incentivized to vote a particular way (i.e., vote buying)

Now, one obvious idea is to print a receipt with your vote plus a confirmation number.  That solves (1) -- your receipt doesn't have your name on it.  All votes can be published for transparent counting without revealing names, so it also solves (2) -- you can lookup your confirmation # in the published results and check that your vote is correct.

The problem is, it also makes it possible to (illegally) buy votes -- someone could offer $5 for every Obama receipt, for example, or your employer could make your job conditional on a Romney receipt.

The reason receipts have any value, though, is that their supply is restricted: only one per voter.  So what if we increase the supply?

For example, every voting machine could print two identical receipts for your vote.  One you take, and the other gets dropped into a bucket in the voting booth.  If someone's incentivizing you to vote a certain way, you're completely free to rummage around in the bucket for another receipt.

Maybe the details could be tweaked (three receipts?  print extra receipts on demand?  at home?), but it seems like something like this could completely remove any incentive for vote-buying.  What do you think?",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

Supporting ANY deal that offers special consideration under the law for ANY group is a dangerous precedent to set. In this case, it's dangerous for more reasons than simply its precedent. The massive profiteering by executives involved in smoke screen of fraudulent securitization is criminal, unethical, and unacceptable in a country that holds itself up as an example to be emulated.

Since theres little palestinian involvement in that conflict and they dont handle non palestinian refugees, arent they comiting fraud to some level exploiting the conflict under the impresion that they are collecting money for syrian refugees when actually they fall under the responsability of UNHCR ?",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

219,A more secure voting system?,0.0,10jjpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/10jjpd/a_more_secure_voting_system/,0.0,1348712703.0,"So, assume the goal is to keep the principles behind our current voting system and just to make it more secure.

Here's my idea:

So you give a receipt with each vote.  Optionally, you can vote twice in a row (without leaving the booth) and get two receipts, but only the first counts.  

As each person leaves the voting booth, an LED screen visible to everyone in the room keeps a tally and increments by one.  

The voteID and corresponding votes from all receipts can be looked up online and tallied by anyone using excel (or similar).  (This should be delayed somewhat to prevent tying a person to a particular vote or two.)

The website should also show the total number of ""extra"" receipts printed, but not specify which ones they are.

-----

Further Explanation:

The purpose of two receipts is to prevent vote buying.  If someone wants to buy my vote, I can request an extra receipt and give them that in exchange for cash.  They can even look it up if they want to.  It will just appear as a regular vote, even though my actual vote was different.

The percentage of ""fake"" votes is likely to be low, especially once people get used to the system.  It'll likely be low enough that it can be shown to not have the ability to influence the election.

The tally shown to the room helps prevent ballot stuffing.  If the ballot is to be stuff, at some point the end total has to diverge from that number.  This is difficult to do with a room full of people watching at all times.

This system is not immune to corruption, just more resistant.  

In some types of blatant fraud, it's possible that enough receipts from a community could be produced to prove fraud occurred.

In cases of fraud, there should be something like ""Hey, when I left the voting booth at closing time, there was only 9000 votes cast.  How did it get to 12000?"" or ""That tally just jumped from 430 to 500.  I know 70 people haven't voted here in the last 5 minutes."" or ""Why isn't my vote showing up in this system?""

At the very least, this system attempts to ensure that the public *knows* definitively if there is systemic fraud on a more local level, even if it doesn't ensure they can do anything about it.",PoliticalDiscussion,fraud

The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20 inauguration.

Any such move would require a change of federal law, meaning it would need to go through Democrats in the House of Representatives in addition to the Republican-controlled Senate. (The Congressional Research Service actually weighed in on this topic in March, specifically noting that a president has no legal authority to change the date of the election.)

His comments come despite President Donald Trump’s repeated claims that the election was stolen, and his refusal to concede his loss to President-Elect Joe Biden.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Barr said U.S. Attorneys and FBI agents have been working to follow up specific complaints and information they’ve received, but they’ve uncovered no evidence that would change the outcome of the election.

42,Megathread: Trump Fires Top U.S. Election Cybersecurity Official Chris Krebs,56167.0,jw67fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jw67fp/megathread_trump_fires_top_us_election/,6096.0,1605662540.0,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired the top U.S. cybersecurity official Chris Krebs in a tweet, accusing him without evidence of making a ""highly inaccurate"" statement on the security of the U.S. election.

Reuters reported last week that Krebs, who worked on protecting the election from hackers but drew the ire of the Trump White House over efforts to debunk disinformation, had told associates he expected to be fired.

Krebs headed up the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

CISA Deputy Secretary Matthew Travis has now resigned, according to Reuters. Sources at the time of this edit have not fully confirmed if the resignation was voluntary or forced.

74,Megathread: President Donald Trump signs executive order targeting protections for social media platforms,42610.0,gsfg9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gsfg9l/megathread_president_donald_trump_signs_executive/,9866.0,1590701977.0,"President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday designed to limit the legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for the content users post on their platforms.

""Currently, social media giants like Twitter receive an unprecedented liability shield based on the theory that they are a neutral platform, which they are not,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""We are fed up with it. It is unfair, and it's been very unfair.""

The order comes after the president escalated his attacks against Big Tech in recent days — specifically Twitter, which fact-checked him for the first time this week over an unsubstantiated claim that mail-in voting drives voter fraud.

In court on Friday, he pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in the deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

The agreement avoids a second trial on money laundering and other charges.

Manafort was convicted last month on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose banks accounts.

It was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

However, the charges only relate to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign.

On Friday, he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice.

With over 60% of the expected vote in and nearly 8 million votes counted, the No vote (which would retain the Governor) maintains a 67-33 edge and a raw vote lead of nearly 2.8 million. While the remaining vote is expected to be more Republican and, thus, the margin will shrink throughout the night and in the coming days, the remaining vote is unlikely to impact the outcome of the recall.

Had the recall succeeded, Question 2, on who Governor Newsom’s successor would have been, currently shows Republican radio talk show host Larry Elder with 43% of the vote, leading his nearest rival, Democratic YouTube personality Kevin Paffrath, who trails with 11% of the vote.

161,Megathread: White House releases controversial memo on allegations of intelligence abuse,22206.0,7usv0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7usv0k/megathread_white_house_releases_controversial/,18714.0,1517592183.0,">(AP) — The White House on Friday declassified a partisan and bitterly disputed memo on the Russia investigation, clearing the way for House Republicans to release allegations of what they say is FBI misconduct.

>The move came over the fierce objections of the FBI and Justice Department, which have said the document prepared by Republicans on the House intelligence committee is inaccurate and missing critical context.

>The memo alleges that the FBI abused U.S. government surveillance powers in its investigation into Russian election interference. Trump, who has called the investigation a “witch hunt,” has supported the release of the memo in the apparent hopes that it could help undermine the probe being led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

This is a megathread to discuss the authorization and impending release of the House Intelligence Committees memo authored by Rep. Nunes (R-CA). **Please note that off topic and low effort comments may be automatically removed**

2,The Geopolitics of Navalny’s Return & The Future of Democracy in Russia,257.0,lh3i4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/lh3i4n/the_geopolitics_of_navalnys_return_the_future_of/,41.0,1612990227.0,"Alexi Navalny (Алексей Навальный) is the single most visible face of the anti-Putin opposition movement inside Russia, in all its iterations.  He is an attorney, political activist and blogger that gained notoriety through his [crusade](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/04/04/net-impact) against Vladimir Putin.  Primarily through advocacy on YouTube, where his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/NavalnyRu) as of this writing exceeds 6.4 million subscribers, Navalny highlights the Russian government’s corruption with particular emphasis on theft of state assets by Vladimir Putin and the circle of oligarchs that stand behind him. 

**Novichok & Context**

In August 2020, Navalny was hospitalized in Germany following an assassination attempt with a [novichok nerve agent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/world/europe/navalny-opcw-russia-novichok.html).  Novichok nerve agents are a type of binary chemical weapon.  Binary chemical weapons are stored and transported in the form of their less toxic chemical precursors, which makes them harder to identify and detect before use.  Novichok nerve agents belong to a class of chemical weapons developed by the USSR starting in the early 1970s.  While known to be currently manufactured by several other countries outside the current Russian federation, a similar novichok nerve agent was used for the purpose of assassinating Sergei and Yulia Skripal at their home in England in 2018.  

Sergei Skripal was a former Russian military intelligence officer who acted as a double-agent for the United Kingdom’s intelligence services from the 1990s to 2000s.  Skripal was arrested outside his home in Moscow in December 2004, before being convicted of high treason against the Russian federation for his espionage activities in service of the British crown.  

Though sentenced to thirteen years in prison, he was exchanged for several Russian nationals who were imprisoned for life in the United Kingdom as a part of a spy swap in 2010.  While the Russian Federation had since abolished capital punishment, many [suspected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/sergei-skripal-does-revenge-for-treason-lie-behind-harm-to-ex-spy) that Skripal’s assassination was intended as a death sentence carried out from afar.  A similar fate befell the former FSB and KGB officer, Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with a polonium isotope six years after he defected to the United Kingdom in the early 2000s with his wife and young son.  

And Vladimir Putin’s political rivals have not only died as a result of exposure to chemical weapons or radioactive isotopes.  For example, Boris Nemtsov was [gunned down](https://www.tvc.ru/news/show/id/62541) while jogging across the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge in Moscow, in front of the Kremlin walls and near Red Square in February 2015, two days before he was supposed to attend a protest against Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.  Few [seriously questioned](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/world/europe/killing-of-boris-nemtsov-putin-critic-breeds-fear-in-russia.html) Putin’s involvement --- particularly in consideration of the fact that Ramzan Kadyrov’s former security chief almost certainly pulled the trigger.  A [show trial](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/3/russia-five-men-stand-trial-for-boris-nemtsov-murder) resulted in five Chechens being convicted for Nemstov’s assassination.  Beyond Nemtsov, at least Boris Berezovsky, Stanislav Markelov, Anastasia Baburova, Sergei Magnitsky, Anna Politkovskaya, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin all rank among assassinations behind which Putin and his government are the [common denominator](https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-critics-of-vladimir-putin-who-died-20170325-story.html).  

**Neither Death Nor Exile**

Before his return, one might have expected that Navalny would have availed himself of the opportunity to remain in [exile](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/01/06/508477662/political-exile-a-centuries-old-russian-tradition-returns), like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, as opposed to the death he narrowly escaped before.  Navalny chose neither.  

After having recovered from poisoning by the novichok nerve agent, Navalny returned to Russia on January 17, 2021.  Navalny was arrested immediately upon return.  Navalny’s arrest was met with global outrage.  Navalny was convicted of fraud and embezzlement and faced a suspended sentence several years back --- despite the complete lack any credible evidence whatsoever to substantiate the charges.  He has been repeatedly arrested, served multiple prison sentences and he has been physically attacked by Putin’s “supporters” on multiple occasions.  In one such incident, a green dye commonly used as an antiseptic was [thrown in his face](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39735867) while in a [Siberian village](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-39337139).  Despite being subject to politically motivated fake criminal charges, assault and scores of other insults, Navalny has persevered.  

Two days later, on January 19, 2021, Navalny released a video titled [Putin’s Palace - History of the world’s largest bribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipAnwilMncI), which has amassed more than 110,000,000 views since release.  The video alleges that a property valued at approximately $1.37 billion (US) located on the Black Sea was built for Putin’s benefit by the circle of oligarchs that form his inner circle.  Putin denies ownership.  [Yet, BBC coverage from 2012](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17730959) quotes one of Putin’s business associates as having indicated that every last detail of the Bond-villain style palace was designed according to Putin’s precise specifications. 

Around the same time, Navalny released a [recorded phone conversation](https://apnews.com/article/alexei-navalny-poisoning-underpants-202f470c2d1c19151b9deb564d94e8f9) in which he pretended to be an FSB officer, debriefing the FSB agent who poisoned him.  In the call, the poisoner apologetically states that the “situation would have turned out differently” if Navalny’s plane had not made the emergency landing that enabled Navalny to receive emergency medical treatment.  And of course, the situation might further have ended differently had Navalny not received medical care in Germany.  According to the call, the FSB agent placed the combined novichok agent inside Navalny’s underwear.  

Based on its OSINT investigation, Bellingcat [revealed the FSB team of chemical weapons experts behind Navalny’s poisoning](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/) who were likewise involved in a series of other [murders of Russian political activists](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/01/27/navalny-poison-squad-implicated-in-murders-of-three-russian-activists/).  The details of Bellingcat’s investigation are essentially confirmed by the phone call Navalny staged with the FSB operative who poisoned him --- though the FSB told the Associated Press that Navalny’s video was fake.

Following Navalny’s arrest, the largest protests in more than a decade erupted across Russia.  Tens of thousands took to the streets in sub-zero temperatures from Moscow to Yakutsk in which over 5,100 people [were arrested](https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-moscow-coronavirus-pandemic-arrests-russia-085b16035e9c89ffb9919e4d94a2309c) in at least [109 cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/international-home/russia-protests-navalny.html) in each of Russia’s eleven time-zones.  Every single major city in Russia saw demonstrations in support of Navalny, prompting [unprecedented](https://apnews.com/article/world-news-moscow-60bb3ba4b68e80db4239e96c2d7ab060) repression tactics by Russian police. 

Rather than backing down in response, the pro-Navalny demonstrations have continued to gain [momendum](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/across-russia-pro-navalny-demonstrations-continue-to-build-momentum) and show no sign of dissipating.  Masha Gessen [explained](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/alexey-navalnys-fearless-return-to-russia) that:

> [Navalny] has . . . show[n] people what they had always known about the Putin regime but had the option of pretending away.  He has shown the depth of the regime’s corruption.  He has shown that Putin’s secret police carries out murders.  With his return to Russia, he has shown the regime’s utter lack of imagination and inability to plan ahead.  He has also shown that, contrary to the Kremlin’s assertions and to conventional wisdom among Western Russia-watchers, there is an alternative to Putin. 

Now, there is no clear path forward where Putin isn’t the clear loser.  If Putin does manage to eventually kill Navalny, Russia may face international retaliation at least as severe as that imposed on Russia after Sergei Magnitsky’s murder.  On the other hand, if Putin does not manage to kill Navalny, Putin’s political rivals will continue to be emboldened, as Putin’s power-base ages and fragments.  While the point at which domestic and/or international political pressure rises to the level of an existential threat to Putin’s control remains unclear, Navalny has moved Russia in that direction.  Putin has never been weaker than he is now. 

**Geopolitics of Navalny’s Return**

The West is not without leverage against Russia, however limited the options may be.  Economic [sanctions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-eu-idUSKBN2A924T), in particular, are a preferred means of coercion.  For example, in 2012 the Obama Administration signed the bipartisan Magnitsky Act into law, which imposed particularized economic sanctions against individuals implicated in Sergei Magnitsky’s murder in a Moscow prison.  Thereafter, numerous other countries passed similar legislation.  Magnitsky-style sanctions blacklisted named persons from Western banks and financial institutions and prohibited nearly all forms of commercial transaction with Western entities or individuals.  In addition, some states have denied visas, restricted travel and frozen and/or seized assets owned or controlled by individuals subject to such sanctions.  Russia maintains that these efforts violate Russian sovereignty and interfere with Russia’s judicial system.  

So far, the United States and Canada have condemned the Russian government’s actions in relation to Navalny and the protests supporting him.  And beyond Magnitsky-style sanctions, other punitive economic measures have been proposed.  

In Europe, two camps have emerged along familiar lines: (1) the United Kingdom, France, and Central and Eastern European countries like Poland, Romania and the Baltic states which historically take more [hawkish positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/18/alexei-navalny-us-europe-condemn-arrest-of-poisoned-putin-critic.html) toward Russia and Putin’s government; and (2) commercially entangled Western European countries like Germany and Italy, who seek to compartmentalize economic interests and human rights abuses.  

For example, [France](https://www.dw.com/en/france-presses-germany-to-ditch-nord-stream-2-over-navalny/a-56411291) has already urged Germany to scrap the gas pipeline project, Nord Stream 2, with Russia in response to Navalny’s assassination attempt and Russia’s anti-democratic political repression.  Yet, while Berlin has condemned the Kremlin and demanded Navalny’s release, Angela Merkel’s spokeswoman Martina Fietz has made clear that the German government has no intention of changing course with respect to future pipeline construction.  Likewise, Armin Laschet, who is the new leader of Merkel’s CDU party criticized any attempt to use Nord Stream 2 as a tool of political leverage against Putin’s government, [arguing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-laschet-exclusive/exclusive-navalny-affair-no-grounds-to-cancel-nord-stream-pipeline-new-german-cdu-chief-says-idUSKBN2A51FL) that:

> For 50 years, even in the aggressive times of the Cold War, Germany has bought gas from the Soviet Union, now from Russia. The German government is following the right course.

German Economic Minister Peter Altmaier has likewise spoken out against linking Moscow’s political repression to Nord Stream 2, [stating](https://www.rferl.org/a/german-minister-warns-against-linking-fate-of-navalny-with-nord-stream-pipeline/31090454.html) that: 

> Business relationships and business projects that have existed for decades are one thing and serious human rights violations and our reactions to them are another.

Further, calls within the [United Kingdom](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-55844146) to impose sanctions on Russian oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov, who own or control interests in English football teams have been heard throughout Parliament.

But whether it is wise to punish Putin’s Russia for Navalny’s attempted assassination by sanctions or otherwise is another matter entirely.  Would imposing sanctions in response to the assassination attempt be nothing more than a symbolic gesture of condemnation?  Alternatively, would they be oriented towards *actually bringing about democratic reform* inside Russia and ending Putin’s regime?  Would the symbolic value of imposing sanctions at all be worth the risk that their imposition might wind up strengthening Putin’s hold on power?  And of course, would imposing sanctions make Navalny look like the Western puppet that many Putin supporters have alleged?  

The theoretical basis for when sanctions should work is straightforward:  impose costs greater than whatever benefit the target derives from continuing in the conduct for which he is being sanctioned.  And sanctions are typically effective at bringing about the specific harm they are oriented to cause.  The problem is that the harm sanctions create almost never translates to actual changes in policy consistent with the sanction’s intent and often bring about unintended consequences.  

Russia’s own punitive measures against Ukraine in the mid-2000s provide an illustrative example.  [Seitz & Zazzaro]( https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-019-09360-2) found that when Russia punished Ukraine for democratic and pro-Western reform by raising gas prices, those affected “were significantly more likely to change their opinions in support of Western-style political and economic systems” --- the exact opposite of what the Kremlin intended.  There is more to be said about why sanctions typically fail, but for our purposes it is enough to ask whether the foreseeable risks of backlash in response to Western sanctions outweigh any likely benefit.  

**The Future of Democracy in Russia**

Vadim Nikitin and others have [argued](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/putin-navalny-russia-protests/) that Navalny’s decision to return to Russia:

> … was an act of such singular courage that it seemed to send a jolt of electricity through the nation’s jaded conscience

It is by no means clear that Navalny will lead Russia to a democratic future.  Nor is it clear that Putin will not try --- and succeed --- to assassinate Navalny, again.  But this moment belongs to the Russian people, and the United States and Europe would do well to reflect on its significance.  For democracy to prevail in Russia, change must arise from within.  After all, these protests in support of Navalny mirror those that preceded [color revolutions across the Soviet bloc](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/vladimir-putins-unchanging-unthinking-response-to-alexey-navalny).  Likewise, it is worth recalling that six months after Lenin’s [return from exile under similar circumstances](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/vladimir-lenin-return-journey-russia-changed-world-forever-180962127/) in Germany, he led the newly formed Soviet Union that emerged from Imperial Russia’s ashes. 

What is clear is that external pressure --- whether in the form of sanctions, cancelled business dealings or otherwise --- will reinforce Putin’s control of Russian politics and unite Russians against the West.  Several years ago, Navalny was the butt of Russian media late night jokes.  Then, even if many Russians themselves supported democratic reform, few saw Navalny as any kind of real transformative figure or alternative to Putin.  Now, they take to the streets by the tens of thousands in every major city in Russia across Russia’s eleven time zones to demand his release.",geopolitics,fraud

I started a thread to discuss the EU migration crisis in the context of climate change about two weeks ago. During the discussions, I said that [I might start similar threads to discuss how Russia and China might deal with climate change migrants](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/91p63g/eu_migration_crisis_general_discussion/e323rst/). Instead, I decided to start a series about climate change in general, which I hope contributors such as /u/ZeroMikeEchoNovember, /u/cherrykirsche, /u/Dr_Gonzoh, and others who share my interest in looking at how climate change will affect the grand chessboard will find useful or interesting. 

This post is the first post in a weekly series that will serve as discussion-starters for how climate change will affect the geopolitics of various countries and regions. In each of the posts, I will provide a general introduction to the region/country (with links to credible sources), provide figures, and pose several questions. These will serve as the basic starter kits for the discussions. Because I'm just a casual dabbler in the field of IR and geopolitics, these posts are learning experiences, so bear with me. I hope these discussions will be less prone to vote-manipulation and brigading (which seems especially prevalent in recent China-related posts), which is why I was wondering if the moderators would be kind enough to put posts in this series in '[contest mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2012/comments/159bww/introducing_contest_mode_a_tool_for_your_voting/)'.

#Geopolitics and Climate Change: China

&nbsp;

**General Introduction**

China is currently the most populous country on the planet, with a population of [1.4 billion](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=CN&year_high_desc=true) as of 2017. Its population is expected to have reached a plateau and will not see significant change through 2050, when it will begin to gradually decline, reaching roughly 1 billion in 2100, [according to the UN Population Division's projection's medium fertility variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant\)). The country has received a [demographic dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_China) from its One-Child Policy, but seemingly [must return it with interest](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2130737/why-china-must-wake-demographic-reality) as its population rapidly ages at a geopolitically-critical period when it needs to sustain its economic growth.

Since 2000, the country has been a net importer of [agricultural products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_China) due to [depletion of its main aquifers](https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100713/full/466308a.html). There is [strong consensus](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19605) that [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources_of_China) is [already](https://www.ft.com/content/3ee05452-1801-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44) facing [a](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/21/asia/china-water-crisis/index.html) water [crisis](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/china-has-a-water-crisis-how-can-it-be-solved/) even before the effects of climate change have truly been felt. Naturally, China has been looking to solve the problem, though whether or not the problem can be solved and whether or not the attempted solutions (like drastic geoengineering) will lead to unexpected consequences remains to be seen.

China is the [world's second largest economy by nominal GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China), though many, including [prominent Chinese officials](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/11/02/is-china-cooking-the-books-on-economic-expansion), have stated that the numbers have been inflated and are unreliable. In contrast, China's per capita GDP is ranked 71st, indicating that China's economic strength comes from its massive population. China was the world's fastest growing economy until recently. It is currently engaged in [a massive economic and infrastructure project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) that spans the Eurasian supercontinent.

By some measures, the country is considered [a leader in science and technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_China), with some saying that it might become [a superpower in science and innovation](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/these-charts-show-how-china-is-becoming-an-innovation-superpower/), though its firms and institutions are plagued with [academic dishonesty](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-science/china-issues-rules-to-get-tough-on-academic-integrity-idUSKCN1IW01O), [intellectual property theft](https://law.stanford.edu/2018/04/10/intellectual-property-china-china-stealing-american-ip/), and [corruption](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1424571/fraud-academia-killing-chinas-nobel-dream). The lack of strong fundamentals in Chinese [science](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/gauging-the-strength-of-chinese-innovation) and technology, has made it dependent on the west --especially the US-- for its core technologies, and this was exemplified by the effects of the [recent American ban on telecoms giant ZTE](https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2153618/china-reliant-us-core-technology-some-time-so-world). China excels at completing megaprojects, which is especially relevant to managing the effects of climate change.

China is currently [the largest emitter of greenhouse gases by a wide margin](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions), generating roughly double the amount of carbon dioxide than the next largest producer, the United States, despite having taken steps to reduce emissions. Climate change is expected to have a strong impact on China, as it is already struggling to meet water demands while [global water reserves continue to be depleted](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/earth-running-out-water-aquifiers/396152/), and [a very recent study from MIT](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05252-y) concluded that if the world continues down the ""business-as-usual"" path, the North China Plain --the population and agricultural heartland of China-- will regularly see a [wet bulb temperature (WBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature) greater than 35 degrees Celsius, rendering it effectively uninhabitable (""A sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding 35 °C (95 °F) is likely to be fatal even to fit and healthy people, unclothed in the shade next to a fan""), on top of affecting crop yields. China is set to see 67 million displaced by rising sea levels, 400 million potentially affected by an uninhabitable climate, and millions more who will likely be hit by abnormal natural disasters. Given the large Chinese diaspora worldwide, it is likely that China will see an increased outflow of migrants.

Historically, China has been very protective of its sovereignty, and [Confucian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism) culture (which is the cultural core of East Asian countries) is less keen on accepting immigrants than others. This is illustrated by the ethnic makeup of Japan ([reportedly 98.5% Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Japan)), Korea ([96% Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Korea#Ethnic_groups)), Taiwan ([95% Han Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Taiwan#Ethnicity)), and China ([91% Han Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_China_and_Taiwan)). With its agricultural and water supplies already under stress, it is unlikely that China will welcome any significant amount of refugees. China shares borders with many small countries and is within a short distance from many more. Of its neighbors, India is the most populous, and is expected to become the largest country by population by 2025, and one report deems it as [the most vulnerable country to climate change](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-hsbc/india-most-vulnerable-country-to-climate-change-hsbc-report-idUSKBN1GV20Z). Given its prominence in the region, it seems possible that China will face a refugee crisis, though the viable routes should make it easy to defend against (assuming western China is unviable for travel). It is unclear to this writer whether China has a strong pull factor in neighboring countries, like what Europe has in Africa and the Middle East.

**Questions:**

* What are China's prospects for solving its agricultural and water problems?

* Will China's massive population, which has been a major source of leverage for the country in business deals, act as a double-edged sword and become a major burden due to climate change?

* If the above is true, how might China deal with the problem? Would it ""cut a pound of flesh"" from itself? Would it attempt to flex its economic muscles? Would it break character and [take the now-fertile Russian land west of the Urals](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/03/where-do-borders-need-to-be-redrawn/why-china-will-reclaim-siberia)?

* Will China face a climate refugee problem from nearby states?

* In general, how well do you think China will weather climate change, assuming no major geopolitical event occurs?",geopolitics,fraud
4,No Turkish Delight: What Does a Redo of Istanbul’s Election Mean For Turkey?,117.0,bysu7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/bysu7p/no_turkish_delight_what_does_a_redo_of_istanbuls/,9.0,1560136750.0," On March 27th, 1994 Recep Tayyip Erdogan took office as the mayor of Istanbul, launching a career that would eventually make him president of the country. Ever since then, Istanbul has been governed by parties that Erdogan associated himself with. [Since ](https://www.france24.com/en/20190402-erdogan-party-lose-istanbul-mayor-turkey-imamoglu-akp)2004, Erdogan’s AK (Justice and Development) Party has ruled Istanbul. On March 31st, 2019, Binali Yildrim, former Prime Minster and candidate for the ruling AK Party, lost to a little known local politician named Ekrem İmamoğlu by the [narrowest ](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/turkish-opposition-candidate-declared-istanbul-mayor-190417142357942.html)of margins. However, President Erdogan chose to order a rerun of the election, claiming massive fraud without even the [flimsiest ](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/erdogan-backs-call-hold-fresh-elections-istanbul-amid-voter-fraud-allegations)of evidence. The decision plunged Turkey into a political crisis that has only deepened the [economic ](https://www.ft.com/content/92818e7c-43c6-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3)crisis it is mired in. In today’s podcast episode, I will be discussing the transformation of Turkey and Istanbul in the decade that preceded the current crisis, the structural economic weaknesses that has trapped the Turkish economy in cycles of boom and bust, and how Presidenet Erdogan’s autocratic and erratic behavior is only compounding these issues.

In 2002, the year in which the AK Party first won national elections, as the Turkish economy was stuck in a deep recession. Turkey’s economy had [shrank ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242034963_THE_2000-2001_FINANCIAL_CRISIS_IN_TURKEY)by 6% in the preceding year, and the IMF was [demanding](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/pages/publication16004_en.pdf)harsh austerity to unlock much needed finance. The new AK Party continued to austerity program, slashing budgets and [privatizing ](https://preserve.lehigh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&context=perspectives-v28)state owned companies. As painful as the reforms were, they ultimately proved successful. [GDP growth](https://tradingeconomics.com/turkey/gdp-growth-annual) regularly averaged over 7% aside from during the Great Recession. Istanbul was transformed during this period, as [luxury ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-gentrification/gentrification-tears-at-istanbuls-historically-diverse-fabric-idUSKBN0II0G020141029)high rises proliferated in what were once historic districts. The government has announced a series of massive mega-projects. Istanbul is [constructing ](https://phys.org/news/2018-01-turkey-unveils-route-km-istanbul.html)a 45 km canal that will allow ships to bypass the straits of the Bosporus, and a new airport that will be the [largest ](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/istanbul-new-airport)in the world occupying more land than Manhattan is under construction. However, despite all this progress, there was a sense that the concerns of ordinary Istanbul citizens were being ignored in the mad rush to become a global city. Ekrem İmamoğlu was able to run a vigorous based upon local issues, promising a more people centered approach to development and in his brief term as mayor, İmamoğlu [found ](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/world/middleeast/istanbul-mayor-election-erdogan.html)evidence of systematic corruption.

As important as local issues are to understanding the AK Party’s shock defeat in the mayoral election, the dire state of the Turkish economy are just as important. Turkey has long suffered from cycles of [boom and bust](https://tradingeconomics.com/turkey/gdp-growth), going through five sharp recessions since 1980. The root problem behind Turkey’s macroeconomic instability is the perennially low [savings ](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2016/cr16105.pdf)rate. As Turkey’s economy boomed during the 2000s, Turkish corporations could not find sufficient financing from local savings, and were forced to borrow from abroad. I By 2018, foreign currency denominated [corporate debt](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/03/14/the-struggle-to-restore-turkeys-stricken-economy) stood at 35% of GDP. While this debt was essential for fueling economic growth, the fact the debt is denominated in non-Lira currency poses a severe threat to the Turkish economy. In recent months, the combination of Trump’s trade war and rising interest rates in the US have unsettled financial markets, sending [unstable ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-10/seven-em-countries-at-risk-of-exchange-rate-crisis-nomura-says)currencies, such as those of Pakistan, Argentina and Turkey into tailspin. The Turkish Lira has gone from 4.49 to the Euro to 6.62 to the Euro. As a result, interest payments have gone up by 50%, even as domestic sales are denominated in Lira. [Waves ](https://warontherocks.com/2018/10/turkeys-walking-dead-zombie-companies-lurk-around-every-corner/)of Turkish corporations have defaulted on their debt, plunging the Turkish economy on a contraction of 3% in 2019.

Turkey’s economic ills cannot entirely be placed on the global financial context. Erdogan’s government was initially [praised ](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/magazine/the-erdogan-experiment.html)for it’s relaxed repression of Kurds, weakened the political prerogatives of the military, and loosened state enforced secularism. However, his regime has become far more dictatorial in recent years, especially after a [failed ](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/turkey-failed-coup-attempt-161217032345594.html)coup attempt in 2016. After the coup, the government made a mass purge. The government [detained ](https://globalnews.ca/news/4418346/turkey-arrests-post-coup-crackdown/)160,000, purged 130,000 civil servants from office, and closed scores of media outlets. Erdogan also pushed a constitution that effectively centralized all power in the [presidency](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39617700), and has made campaigning [difficult ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/turkey-social-media-arrests/)for the opposition to operate. As Erdogan has centralized decision making in his hands, he has let his worst instincts dominate economic policy making. Erdogan has appointed more yes-men and cronies to power, including [making](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44774316)his son-in-law the finance minister. Erdogan has refused to raise interest rates, in part out of a populist desire to [boost ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-economy/turkeys-erdogan-says-determined-to-lower-interest-rates-to-targeted-levels-idUSKCN1S80XX)his short term popularity, but also out of genuine beliefs that interest rates are evil. The political turmoil caused by Erdogan’s decision to redo elections in Istanbul has plunged the country deeper into political crisis, sending the Lira falling even [further](https://ahvalnews.com/istanbul-elections/turkish-economy-deteriorated-due-ruling-partys-istanbul-election-hustle-main).

The AK pary’s ascension to power 2002 at first seemed to mark a major transformation of Turkey. However, over time Turkey fell into old patterns of boom and bust and non-democratic government. It is clear that if the new elections in Istanbul are free and fair, Ekrem İmamoğlu will by an even larger margin. Erdogan’s government, even when far from democratic, has always relied upon broad public support and a veneer of democratic legitimacy. Cancelling Istanbul’s election erases this veneer, even though the mayor of Istanbul isn’t in a real position to challenge the president. The latest decision making has made Erdogan’s erratic behavior more clear, and senior members of the AK Party are [threatening ](https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/06/06/turkeys-president-erdogan-may-face-a-mutiny-in-his-own-party)to leave and form their own party. Ironically, it seems Erdogan’s attempts to centralize power in his hands has had only the opposite effect.

5,Culminating Analysis of DNC/DCCC/Soros/Colin-Powell/NATO-General-Breedlove/NSA-Equation-Group/Podesta Leaks and Hacks,96.0,5bgwfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5bgwfj/culminating_analysis_of/,15.0,1478453724.0,"It has been a running theme lately that the U.S. government blaming Russia for the DNC/Podesta leaks is an attempt at deflection and is false. In the past few days, however, some very interesting pieces of information have come out from three different well-respected cybersecurity companies tasked with investigating the leaks or the groups behind these leaks. These companies are CrowsdStrike, Symantec, and SecureWorks. I think it is important that we cast away the media's non-technical analyses and go straight to the source.

The founder of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American and his company has been tasked with investigating the DNC/Podesta leaks. He blames Mother Russia. Relevant excerpts:

>At six o'clock on the morning of May 6, Dmitri Alperovitch woke up in a Los Angeles hotel to an alarming email. Alperovitch is the thirty-six-year-old cofounder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and late the previous night, his company had been asked by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a possible breach of its network. A CrowdStrike security expert had sent the DNC a proprietary software package, called Falcon, that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. Falcon ""lit up,"" the email said, within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC: Russia was in the network.

>Alperovitch, a slight man with a sharp, quick demeanor, called the analyst who had emailed the report. ""Are we sure it's Russia?"" he asked.

>The analyst said there was no doubt. Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike's experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia's answer to the CIA; and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence.

>Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald fifty-four-year-old former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike's president of services. Henry led a forensics team that retraced the hackers' steps and pieced together the pathology of the breach. Over the next two weeks, they learned that Cozy Bear had been stealing emails from the DNC for more than a year. Fancy Bear, on the other hand, had been in the network for only a few weeks. Its target was the DNC research department, specifically the material that the committee was compiling on Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meanwhile, a CrowdStrike group called the Overwatch team used Falcon to monitor the hackers, a process known as shoulder-surfing.

>Ultimately, the teams decided it was necessary to replace the software on every computer at the DNC. Until the network was clean, secrecy was vital. On the afternoon of Friday, June 10, all DNC employees were instructed to leave their laptops in the office. Alperovitch told me that a few people worried that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was clearing house. ""Those poor people thought they were getting fired,"" he says.

>For the next two days, three CrowdStrike employees worked inside DNC headquarters, replacing the software and setting up new login credentials using what Alperovitch considers to be the most secure means of choosing a password: flipping through the dictionary at random. (After this article was posted online, Alperovitch noted that the passwords included random characters in addition to the words.) The Overwatch team kept an eye on Falcon to ensure there were no new intrusions. On Sunday night, once the operation was complete, Alperovitch took his team to celebrate at the Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chão.

>...

>Aperovitch's June 14 blog post garnered so much media attention that even its ebullient author felt slightly overwhelmed. Inevitably there were questions about the strange names his company had given the Russian hackers. As it happened, ""Fancy Bear"" and ""Cozy Bear"" were part of a coding system Alperovitch had created. Animals signified the hackers' country of origin: Russians were bears, Chinese were pandas, Iranians were kittens, and North Koreans were named for the chollima, a mythical winged horse. By company tradition, the analyst who discovers a new hacker gets to choose the first part of the nickname. Cozy Bear got its nickname because the letters coz appeared in its malware code. Fancy Bear, meanwhile, used malware that included the word Sofacy, which reminded the analyst who found it of the Iggy Azalea song ""Fancy.""

>The day after the media maelstrom, the reporters were back with less friendly questions: Had Alperovitch gotten his facts right? Was he certain Russia was behind the DNC hacks? The doubts were prompted by the appearance of a blogger claiming to be from Eastern Europe who called himself Guccifer 2.0. Guccifer said that the breach was his, not Russia's. ""DNC'S servers hacked by a lone hacker,"" he wrote in a blog post that included stolen files from the DNC. ""I guess CrowdStrike customers should think twice about company's competence,"" Guccifer wrote. ""Fuck CrowdStrike!!!!!!!!!""

>an incorrect attribution in public. ""Did we miss something?"" he asked CrowdStrike's forensics team. Henry and his staff went back over the evidence, all of which supported their original conclusion.

>Alperovitch had also never seen someone claim to be the only intruder on a site. ""No hacker goes into the network and does a full forensic investigation,"" he told me. Being called out, he said, was ""very shocking. It was clearly an attack on us as well as on the DNC.""

>Alperovitch initially thought that the leaks were standard espionage and that Guccifer's attacks on CrowdStrike were just a noisy reaction to being busted. ""I thought, Okay, they got really upset that they were caught,"" he said. But after documents from the DNC continued to leak, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than that. He concluded that the Russians wanted to use the leaked files to manipulate U. S. voters—a first. ""It hit me that, holy crap, this is an influence operation. They're actually trying to inject themselves into the election,"" he said. ""I believe that we may very well wake up on the morning the day after the election and find statements from Russian adversaries saying, 'Do not trust the result.' ""

>...

>Days later, Alperovitch got a call from a Reuters reporter asking whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been hacked. CrowdStrike had, in fact, been working on a breach at the DCCC; once again, Alperovitch believed that Russia was responsible. Now, however, he suspected that only Fancy Bear was involved. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author.

>Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0's website. This time he released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, he went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress.

>...

>Alperovitch's friends in government told him privately that an official attribution so close to the election would look political. If the government named Russia, it would be accused of carrying water for Hillary Clinton. The explanations upset Alperovitch. The silence of the American government began to feel both familiar and dangerous. ""It doesn't help us if two years from now someone gets indicted,"" he said. After Michelle Obama's passport was published online, on September 22, Alperovitch threw up his hands in exasperation. ""That is Putin giving us the finger,"" he told me.

The guy responsible for ousting Stuxnet as being an American/Israeli cyberworm (no friend of the U.S. government/establishment) also says that his company, Symantec, has found that Russia was responsible for the leaks:

>It is pretty clear judging by the indicators of compromise [IOCs]. The binaries that were used to hack the DNC as well as Podesta’s email as well as some other Democratic campaign folks, those IOCs match binaries and also infrastructure that was used in attacks that were previously recorded by others as having Russian origin. That much we can confirm. So if you believe other people’s—primarily government’s—attribution that those previous attacks were Russian, then these attacks are definitely connected. We’re talking about the same binaries, the same tools, the same infrastructure. 

>We’ve analyzed the tools, the binaries, and the infrastructure that was used in the attack, and from that we can confirm that it’s connected to a group that has two names. One is Sofacy, or “Cozy Bear,” and The Dukes, which is also known as “Fancy Bear.” From the binary analysis point of view, I can tell you that the activities of these attackers have been during Russian working hours, either centered on UTC+3 or UTC+4; they don’t work Russian holidays; they work Monday to Friday; there are language identifiers inside that are Russian; when you look at all the victim profiles they would be in interest to the Russian nation-state. So all of that stuff fits the profile. Now, could all those things be false flags? Sure. Other government entities obviously have come out and said it is the Russian state, and the binary forensics would definitely match that.

>There was another attack that happened in the Ukraine. So in December, in the Ukraine, all the power went out to about 260,000 households, or customers. They basically infiltrated the power company, got access to the machines that controlled the power, they flipped the computer switches off and shut down the power, and then they began to wipe all the machines and devices—overriding the hard drives and trashing the machines so that they couldn’t be started up again, or so that the switches couldn’t come on again. Ukrainians were able to get power back after six hours by switching to manual mode. They went off their computer monitor mode and physically flipped the switches to bring the power back up. What’s interesting about that case is the fact that they were more behind technologically actually helped them. Something very similar could easily happen in the U.S. and we’re much more beholden to computing infrastructure here, so our ability to switch to manual mode here would be much more difficult.

>>Is there linkage between the DNC and Podesta hacks and the 2014 State Department hacks that were also believed to be carried out by Russia?

>Yeah, these are being conducted by the same groups. We know that from the IOCs—by looking at the tools they use and the infrastructure they use. 

>Many of these attacks were happening prior to the nomination of Trump. Based on that theory, people believe that there was a general plan for disruption, and it may be the case now that the easiest and best way to do so is in the manner you speak, but these attacks did not just start happening post-Trump’s nomination. So in that sense, there is a feeling that it’s not a very Trump-specific activity versus an election disruption activity. This is the easiest way for them to disrupt the election.

Another cybersecurity company, SecureWorks, has published some interesting blogposts about all this:

>In mid-2015, CTU researchers discovered TG-4127 using the accoounts-google . com domain in spearphishing attacks targeting Google Account users. The domain was used in a phishing URL submitted to Phishtank, a website that allows users to report phishing links (see Figure 1).

>[Figure 1. Example of accoounts-google . com used in a phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image001_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=53&w=700&hash=5EFFAB208B8129679AA1DD2799DF1DA6C304BF1E&la=en)

>Recipients who clicked the link were presented with a fake Google Account login page (see Figure 2). The threat actors could use entered credentials to access the contents of the associated Gmail account.

>[Figure 2. Fake Google Account login page.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image002_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=525&w=700&hash=A09261000379B1497696C542381E4C36B8B1D582&la=en)

>**Encoded target details**

>Analysis of the phishing URL revealed that it includes two Base64-encoded values (see Figure 3). The decoded Base64 values (see Table 1) match the Gmail account and its associated Google Account username. If a target clicks the phishing link, the username field of the displayed fake Google Account login page is prepopulated with the individual’s email address.

>[Figure 3. Spearphishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=46&w=700&hash=3D077E948C7CDC6AD033007FC7BEA5C522C77BC4&la=en)

>[Table 1. Decoded Base64 values from the phishing URL used by TG-4127.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image003-B_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=83&w=700&la=en&hash=4C167E12D168951236C212619C6FAFB6878C6EB1)

>**Use of the Bitly URL-shortening service**

>A Bitly URL was uploaded to Phishtank at almost the same time as the original spearphishing URL (see Figure 4).

>[Figure 4. Bitly phishing URL submitted at same time as accoounts-google . com phishing URL.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image004_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=96&w=700&hash=3F1B911C3F7C4C3C316875D1E162C27944F089B2&la=en)

>Using a tool on Bitly’s website, CTU researchers determined that the Bitly URL redirected to the original phishing URL (see Figure 5). Analysis of activity associated with the Bitly account used to create the shortened URL revealed that it had been used to create more than 3,000 shortened links used to target more than 1,800 Google Accounts.

>[Figure 5. Link-shortener page for bit.ly/1PXQ8zP that reveals the full URL. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image005_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=195&w=700&hash=C6D25DD8BD795D1C1820667A43280CDFCA531A2B&la=en)

>**Target analysis**

>CTU researchers analyzed the Google Accounts targeted by TG-4127 to gain insight about the targets and the threat group’s intent.

>**Focus on Russia and former Soviet states**

>Most of the targeted accounts are linked to intelligence gathering or information control within Russia or former Soviet states. The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russia’s military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for example, the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian prime minister. Other targets included individuals in political, military, and diplomatic positions in former Soviet states, as well as journalists, human rights organizations, and regional advocacy groups in Russia.

>**Other targets worldwide**

>Analysis of targeted individuals outside of Russia and the former Soviet states revealed that they work in a wide range of industry verticals (see Figure 6). The groups can be divided into two broad categories:

>* Authors, journalists, NGOs, and political activists (36%)
>* Government personnel, military personnel, government supply chain, and aerospace researchers (64%)

>TG-4127 likely targeted the groups in the first category because they criticized Russia. The groups in the second category may have information useful to the Russian government.

>[Figure 6. TG-4127 targeting outside of Russia and former Soviet states. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image006_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=453&w=569&hash=90B644F7BA1914EAAE3DE8E88A477AEBF6A5FAA9&la=en)

>**Authors and journalists**

>More than half (53%) of the targeted authors and journalists are Russia or Ukraine subject matter experts (see Figure 7). It is likely that the Russian state has an interest in how it is portrayed in the media. U.S.-based military spouses who wrote online content about the military and military families were also targeted. The threat actors may have been attempting to learn about broader military issues in the U.S., or gain operational insight into the military activity of the target’s spouse.

>[Figure 7. Subject matter expertise of authors and journalists targeted by TG-4127. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image007_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=554&w=700&hash=4C7BA6262DE17D1D89563374E199D507FD70CEF7&la=en)

>**Government supply chain**

>CTU researchers identified individuals who were likely targeted due to their position within the supply chain of organizations of interest to TG-4127 (e.g., defense and government networks). Figure 8 shows the distribution by category. The targets included a systems engineer working on a military simulation tool, a consultant specializing in unmanned aerial systems, an IT security consultant working for NATO, and a director of federal sales for the security arm of a multinational technology company. The threat actors likely aimed to exploit the individuals’ access to and knowledge of government clients’ information.

>[Figure 8. Categories of supply chain targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image008_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=442&w=700&hash=A96E1DED22B814F5CA2F38442BA79CFA50897977&la=en)

>**Government / military personnel**

>TG-4127 likely targeted current and former military and government personnel for potential operational insight gained from access to their personal communications. Most of the activity focused on individuals based in the U.S. or working in NATO-linked roles (see Figure 9).

>[Figure 9. Nation or organization of government/military targets.](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/072%20Google%20Accounts/image009_ta-google-accounts.ashx?h=485&w=700&hash=6C9B3BC342F030E561737A77A955478641C74F49&la=en)

>TG-4127 targeted high-profile Syrian rebel leaders, including a leader of the Syrian National Coalition. Russian forces have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime since September 2015, so it is likely the threat actors are seeking to gain intelligence on rebel forces to assist Russian and Assad regime military operations.

>**Success of the phishing campaign**

>CTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September, 2015. More than half (59%) of the URLs were accessed, suggesting that the recipients at least opened the phishing page. From the available data, it is not possible to determine how many of those Google Accounts were compromised. Most of the targeted accounts received multiple phishing attempts, which may indicate that previous attempts had been unsuccessful. However, 35% of accounts that accessed the malicious link were not subject to additional attempts, possibly indicating that the compromise was successful.

>Of the accounts targeted once, CTU researchers determined that 60% of the recipients clicked the malicious Bitly. Of the accounts that were targeted more than once, 57% of the recipients clicked the malicious link in the repeated attempts. These results likely encourage threat actors to make additional attempts if the initial phishing email is unsuccessful.

Here's another article by SecureWorks:

>**Spearphishing details**

>The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.

>**Hillary for America**

>TG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation of the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page (see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account.

>[Figure 1. Example of a TG-4127 fake Google Account login page. ](https://www.secureworks.com/~/media/Images/Insights/Resources/Threat%20Analyses/071%20Hillary%20Clinton%20Campaign/image001-rev.ashx?la=en&hash=55CF7747F1989C49AE6B9BED081A37B6F3F6F94A)

>CTU researchers observed the first short links targeting hillaryclinton.com email addresses being created in mid-March 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108 email addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the owners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses, suggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity.

>The identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending from senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures managed communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures arranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles:

> * National political director
> * Finance director
> * Director of strategic communications
> * Director of scheduling
> * Director of travel
> * Traveling press secretary
> * Travel coordinator

>Publicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a spearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been clicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three times, and two were clicked four times.

>**Democratic National Committee**

>CTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network.

>**Personal email accounts**

>CTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the Hillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a hillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications, media, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy director office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40 of the links have been clicked at least once.

>**Related activity and implications**

>Although the 2015 campaign did not focus on individuals associated with U.S. politics, open-source evidence suggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S. Republican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and mid-May.

[How Russia Pulled Off the Biggest Election Hack in U.S. History](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49791/russian-dnc-emails-hacked/)

Guccifer2.0, The Shadow Brokers, and DCLeaks, who have all leaked U.S. documents/cyberweapons, love talking about the ""U.S. elite"" and ""corruption"" in America, along with saying ""the elections are rigged."" I wonder why these people suddenly became so interested in the U.S. election?

Regardless, we know from the Bit.ly victim profiles that Podesta, the DNC, Ukrainian/Russian journalists, Bellingcat and other enemies of Russia were targeted by these groups. This also means that those targeted by DCLeaks and Guccifer2.0 were the same people, and that the aforementioned entities are actually one. 

Why would they lie about being separate groups?

Lastly, I have gone through all the public statements made by these groups, by going through their Twitter/Tumblr/Medium/WordPress/web posts. Here are some of the comments made by DCLeaks, Guccifer2.0 and The Shadow Brokers. Tell me if you notice a common theme:

**DCLeaks**

Known for hacking the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former NATO General Breedlove, as well as Soros' OSF intranet documents.

>George Soros is a Hungarian-American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, political activist and author who is of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry and holds dual citizenship. He drives more than 50 global and regional programs and foundations. Soros is named an architect and a sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years. The USA is thought to be a vampire due to him and his puppets, not a lighthouse of freedom and democracy. His minions spill blood of millions and millions of people just to make him even more rich. Soros is an oligarch sponsoring the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton, hundreds of politicians all over the world. This website is designed to let everyone inside George Soros’ Open Society Foundation and related organisations. We present you the workplans, strategies, priorities and other activities of Soros. These documents shed light on one of the most influential network operating worldwide.

>---

>Looks like Clinton's staff doesn't care about security.Wonder from whom did they learn it..

>---

>FBI hq is a great place for club meeting especially when Clinton is under investigation

A further look at their Twitter account reveals that they mostly re-tweet WikiLeaks/RT/PressTV, hate Clinton, like Trump, love talking about the email scandal, post conspiracy theories about Mark Zuckerberg, exclusively target Russia's enemies (like former NATO General Breedlove, Soros, Colin Powell, etc,.), defend Russia from being attacked, and have a penchant for focusing on news portraying the U.S. elections/debates as ""rigged"":

**Guccifer 2.0**

Known for hacking the DNC and DCCC.

>Together we’ll be able to throw off the political elite, the rich clans that exploit the world!

>Fuck the lies and conspirators like DNC!!!

>---

>Who inspires me? Not the guys like Rambo or Terminator or any other like them. The world has changed. Assange, Snowden, and Manning are the heroes of the computer age. They struggle for truth and justice; they struggle to make our world better, more honest and clear. People like them make us hope for tomorrow. They are the modern heroes, they make history right now.

>Marcel Lazar is another hero of mine. He inspired me and showed me the way. He proved that even the powers that be have weak points.

>Anyway it seems that IT-companies and special services can’t realize that people like me act just following their ideas but not for money. They missed the bus with Assange and Snowden, they are not ready to live in the modern world. They are not ready to meet people who are smart and brave, who are eager to fight for their ideals, who can sacrifice themselves for the better future. Working for a boss makes them slow I suppose.
Do you need more proof?

>---

> don’t want to disappoint anyone, but none of the candidates has my sympathies. Each of them has skeletons in the closet and I think people have a right to know the truth about the politicians.

>As for me, I see great differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hillary seems so much false to me, she got all her money from political activities and lobbying, she is a slave of moguls, she is bought and sold. She never had to work hard and never risked everything she had. Her words don’t meet her actions. And her collusion with the DNC turned the primaries into farce.

>Opposite to her, Donald Trump has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says. His position is straight and clear.

>Anyway that doesn’t mean that I support him. I’m totally against his ideas about closing borders and deportation policy. It’s a nonsense, absolute bullshit.

>I have nothing to say about Bernie Sanders. It seems he never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him!

>---

>Here are the DCCC docs on Florida: reports, memos, briefings, dossiers, etc. You can have a look at who you are going to elect now. It may seem the congressional primaries are also becoming a farce.

>---

>As you can see, the private server of the Clinton clan contains docs and donors lists of the Democratic committees, PACs, etc. Does it surprise you?

>---


>It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds.

>---

>I found out something interesting in emails between DNC employees and Hillary Clinton campaign staff. Democrats prepare a new provocation against Trump. After Trump sent his financial report in May it appeared on DNC servers at once. DNC rushed to analyze it and asked the Jones Mandel company to make an effective investigation. I won’t be surprised if some mainstream media like the New York Times or CNN publish soon Trump’s financial docs. No doubt who could give them.

>---

>I’d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.

>As I’ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities.

>I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.

>I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.

He frequently re-tweets WikiLeaks, just like DCLeaks. He re-tweets and follows conspiracy theory outlets like Alex Jones and Roger Stone, just like DCLeaks followed RT and PressTV. Of course, he sprang back to life two days ago, right before Election Day, to complain about ""Democrats rigging the election."" I thought he didn't favour any political party?

**The Shadow Brokers**

Known for leaking the NSA's elite hacking entity's, Equation Group's, cyberweapons. 

>!!! Attention Wealthy Elites !!!

>We have final message for “Wealthy Elites”. We know what is wealthy but what is Elites? Elites is making laws protect self and friends, lie and fuck other peoples. Elites is breaking laws, regular peoples go to jail, life ruin, family ruin, but not Elites. Elites is breaking laws, many peoples know Elites guilty, Elites call top friends at law enforcement and government agencies, offer bribes, make promise future handjobs, (but no blowjobs). Elites top friends announce, no law broken, no crime commit. Reporters (not call journalist) make living say write only nice things about Elites, convince dumb cattle, is just politics, everything is awesome, check out our ads and our prostitutes. Then Elites runs for president. Why run for president when already control country like dictatorship? What this have do with fun Cyber Weapons Auction? We want make sure Wealthy Elite recognizes the danger cyber weapons, this message, our auction, poses to their wealth and control. Let us spell out for Elites. Your wealth and control depends on electronic data. You see what “Equation Group” can do. You see what cryptolockers and stuxnet can do. You see free files we give for free. You see attacks on banks and SWIFT in news. Maybe there is Equation Group version of cryptolocker+stuxnet for banks and financial systems? If Equation Group lose control of cyber weapons, who else lose or find cyber weapons? If electronic data go bye bye where leave Wealthy Elites? Maybe with dumb cattle? “Do you feel in charge?” Wealthy Elites, you send bitcoins, you bid in auction, maybe big advantage for you?

>TheShadowBrokers is having special trick or treat for Amerikanskis tonight. But first questions.

>Why is DirtyGrandpa threating CIA cyberwar with Russia? Why not threating with NSA or CyberCommand? CIA is cyber B-Team, yes? Where is cyber A-Team? Maybe threating is not being for external propaganda? Maybe is being for internal propaganda? Oldest control trick in book, yes? Waving flag, blaming problems on external sources, not taking responsibility for failures. But neverminding, hacking DNC is way way most important than EquationGroup losing capabilities. Amerikanskis is not knowing USSA cyber capabilities is being screwed? Where is being “free press”? Is ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX negligent in duties of informing Amerikanskis? Guessing “Free Press” is not being “Free as in free beer” or “Free as in free of government influence?

>Let us be speaking regarding corruption. If Peoples#1 is having $1.00 and Peoples#2 is having $1000.00 which peoples is having more money? Which peoples is having more spending power? Voter$1 is giving $1 to politician and Voter$1000 is giving $1000 to politician, which voters is having more political power? Is both voters having equal political power? “one person, one vote”? Politicians, lobbyist, media, even SCOTUS (supreme court) is saying this is being true, money is not corrupting. In binary world, maybe. But world is not being binary, is it? What about peoples#3, VoterUndecided? VoterUndecided is giving no moneys and no votes. Politician is needing money for campaign to buy advertising, positive media stories, advisors, pollsters, operatives to be making VoterUndecided vote for politician. Political fundrasing, now which voter is having more political power? VoterUndecided votes for politician and politician wins. Re-election is coming. Government budget decision is required. Voter$1 is wanting politician to be spending taxes on education for making children into great thinkers, leaders, scientists. Voter$1000 is shareholder of defense & intelligence company is wanting politician spending taxes on spying and war to be making benefit self, for great profit. Political favors, now, which voter is having more political power? Did theshadowbrokers lose Amerikanskis? Amerikanskis is still thinking “one person, one vote”? Money isn’t corrupting elections, politics, govenments?

>USSA elections is coming! 60% of Amerikansky never voting. Best scenario is meaning half of remaining red or blue fanatics or 20% of the most fanatical is picking USSA government? A great power. A free country. A good-doer. TheShadowBrokers is having suggestion. On November 8th, instead of not voting, maybe be stopping the vote all together? Maybe being grinch who stopped election from coming? Maybe hacking election is being the best idea? #hackelection2016. If peoples is not being hackers, then #disruptelection2016, #disruptcorruption2016. Maybe peoples not be going to work, be finding local polling places and protesting, blocking , disrupting , smashing equipment, tearing up ballots? The wealthy elites is being weakest during elections and transition of power. Is being why USSA is targeting elections in foreign countries. Don’t beleiving? Remembering Iran elections? Rembering stuxnet? Maybe is not Russia hacking election, maybe is being payback from Iran?

/u/ImChrisHansenn were able to accomplish by some research yesterday. Every story contains real world events that have actually happened with actual whistleblowers and governments around the world. As a geopolicical subreddit how do you view these stories and situations compared with current situations happening around the world right now with people like Assange, Manning, Snowden, and others.


My post follows below.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's all an act of aggression against everyone involved. They are just testing the water to see what they are capable of getting away with.

You want a spy movie read? Check this out. It's all from real world events.
If you piece together all the Wikipedia articles about Litvinenko, the Russian Apartment Bombings, Assassinated businessman Boris Berezovsky, Asassinated journalist Anna Politkovskaya, the Stratfor Hack which ties multinational corporations to Private Intelligence Corporations, Global Intelligence, Private Security Contractors, Money Laundering to hide the trail of the decision makers, their relations to Wikileaks, Wikilieaks relation to whistleblowers, and Snowden's current situation of being a whistle blower....

Everything starts to get crazy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko#Russian_apartment_bombings
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Berezovsky_(businessman)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Stratfor_email_leak

>WikiLeaks founder **Julian Assange told Reuters that his concerns with Stratfor stem from it being a private intelligence firm relying on informants from government agencies with dubious reputations, both from the U.S. and abroad,** and especially its targeting of activist organizations.[5] He also called the company a ""shadow CIA"" and stated that the emails would ""reveal Stratfor's web of informers, payoff structure, payment-laundering techniques and psychological methods.""[24]

>Al Akhbar, citing internal emails from the **Stratfor hack, reported former Blackwater director James F. Smith had a relationship with Stratfor and was for a time considered one of their major sources. Emails appeared to show that Smith participated in the murder of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi**, and had more recently been assigned to aid the rebellion against the government of Bashar Assad in Syria. In relation to his assignment to Syria, Smith requested an intelligence overview of the Syrian opposition from his Stratfor briefers.[17]

>An email involving **a Stratfor analyst stated that it had been determined that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency knew of Osama bin-Laden's safe house.**[11]

>emails reveal that Stratfor had been partnering with Shea Morenz, a former **Goldman Sachs director, along with other informants, in order to profit from what could be considered insider trading. Stratfor planned to use the intelligence it gathered in order to profit from trading in several worldwide markets.** They created an offshore ""share structure"" known as ""StratCap"" during 2011, in order to avoid insider trading allegations.

Also worth checking out is Russian President Vladimir Putins role in Gazprom the largest natural gas comapany in Europe and one of the largest corporations in the world. 

Here is the type of organization Putin made Gazprom.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_champions

>National champion is a political concept in which large corporations in strategic sectors are expected not only to seek profit but also to ""advance the interests of the nation.” This policy has been popular and practiced by many countries.

Next is worth checking out Putin's networth. (Dick Cheney, Haliburton, etc)

Review everything above with past CIA/NSA scandals from the United States at home and abroad and you can see just how fucked up and interwoven everything and everyone in power really is.

As well as *whistleblowers from the World Bank* of which almost every nation is a member. They help move the secretive money around and launder it all.

http://nsnbc.me/2013/06/12/world-bank-whistleblower-karen-hudes-arrainged-to-federal-court-on-13-june/

>**Allied Barton, the International Security Contractor and contractor for security personnel at the World Bank** who was responsible for **Hudes´illegal arrest**, *is owned by members of the same cartel that controls the Bank for International Settlements, 40 percent of the asset value of 43,000 transnational corporations and financial institutions, and 60% of their annual earnings.* http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1107/1107.5728v2.pdf

another one - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-lawton/world-bank-whistleblower_b_3350872.html

http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2012/0716/feature-world-bank-robert-zoellick-too-big-to-fail.html

Internal reports, reviewed by FORBES, show, for example, that even after Zoellick implemented a budget freeze some officials operated an off-budget system that defies cost control, while **others used revolving doors to game the system to make fortunes for themselves or enhance their positions within the bank.** Why not track all the cash? 

Good luck: Bank sources cite up to $2 billion that may have gone unaccounted for recently amid computer glitches.

Sadly, the last part is cultural: The bank, those inside and outside it say, **is so obsessed with reputational risk that it reflexively covers up anything that could appear negative, rather than address it. Whistle-blower witch hunts (see box, p. 92) undermine the one sure way to root out problems at a Washington headquarters dominated by fearful** yes-men and yes-women, who–wary of a quick expulsion back to their own countries– rarely offer their true opinions.

The UK Serious Fraud Office also called the Securities and Exchange Commission to inquire into the World Bank’s accounting irregularities. Hudes reported to UK Parliament that the SEC stonewalled the Serious Fraud Office.

Edit - Just to note since my comment will probably have a lot of responses I would like you to remember the links posted and their stories and also think about how it's all just so unbelievable that these situations are happening.

*And have been for a while. It just goes to show how much distraction there is and how much pressure is put onto whistleblowers to keep information like these stories from having staying power in the mainstream media.*

Imagine if these were the types of stories the press reported on instead of the stories we get from them now.

I honestly think the JCPOA was only done, because American and European businesses wanted to start trading in Iran---money rules everything. 

Israel and Saudi Arabia kept saying the deal made it EASIER for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.  The Obama administration brushed all these concerns off.  Then Trump came in and got the US out of the JCPOA and intensified sanctions on Iran.  He is basically doing everything Israel and Saudi Arabia wants plus more.

Now that Trump has ""officially"" lost (we have to see the official results---whether fraud was involved), Bibi/Crown Prince/Mike Pompeo are having secret meetings.

If I am Israel or Saudi Arabia, at this point you may have to consider war.  Biden has said he will go back into a ""deal"" with Iran IRRELEVANT of what Israel or Saudi Arabia have to say.  I feel like Israel, Saudi Arabia, (possibly even the US) will start a MASSIVE war in Iran within the next 30-40 days.

If this is done, then it would prevent Biden from going into any ""peace deal"" or the JCPOA with Iran and would FORCE Biden to support Israel and Saudi Arabia.  Imagine if Trump/CP MBS/Netanyahu launched a SUDDEN MASSIVE STRIKE into Iran?  Thousands die.  There will be no recourse from this.

This may be the only option in Saudi Arabia and Israel's mind, as a possible 4-8 years of Biden may be too risky for their National Security.  I think they will strike Iran and force Biden's hand.  They will do anything to prevent Biden from going back into the nuclear deal.

War is the ONLY option for Israel and Saudi Arabia.

>After years of studying it, I believe that cryptocurrency is an inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificially enforced scarcity.

>Despite claims of “decentralization”, the cryptocurrency industry is controlled by a powerful cartel of wealthy figures who, with time, have evolved to incorporate many of the same institutions tied to the existing centralized financial system they supposedly set out to replace.

>The cryptocurrency industry leverages a network of shady business connections, bought influencers and pay-for-play media outlets to perpetuate a cult-like “get rich quick” funnel designed to extract new money from the financially desperate and naive.

>Financial exploitation undoubtedly existed before cryptocurrency, but cryptocurrency is almost purpose built to make the funnel of profiteering more efficient for those at the top and less safeguarded for the vulnerable.

>Cryptocurrency is like taking the worst parts of today's capitalist system (eg. corruption, fraud, inequality) and using software to technically limit the use of interventions (eg. audits, regulation, taxation) which serve as protections or safety nets for the average person.

>Lose your savings account password?   Your fault.

>This is the type of dangerous “free for all” capitalism cryptocurrency was unfortunately architected to facilitate since its inception.

>But these days even the most modest critique of cryptocurrency will draw smears from the powerful figures in control of the industry and the ire of retail investors who they’ve sold the false promise of one day being a fellow billionaire. Good-faith debate is near impossible.

>For these reasons, I simply no longer go out of my way to engage in public discussion regarding cryptocurrency. It doesn't align with my politics or belief system, and I don't have the energy to try and discuss that with those unwilling to engage in a grounded conversation.

I know my previous post I mention in ""background reading"" were posted in conspiracy subs, but I assure you they are fact based, and only legitimate government articles, academic articles, and security organization articles are used as sources. I simply didn't know of any other subs that would take this type of geopolitical issues that amount to conspiracy seriously.

If you have any suggestions for political discussion subs that would like to discuss this material, please inform me of them.

_____________

**Background Reading:**

I've done extensive research on Russia's tactic they call Informatsionnoye Protivoborstvo, IPb, which translates to Information Confrontation, or Information War. A tactic started in the 1990's after the collapse of the USSR. Deemed ""Sixth Generation Warfare"" by Russian military. It was designed to blur the lines between war and peace.

I've wrote extensively on it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gczekd/informatsionnoye_protivoborstvo_ipb/

And the same post but further expanded to include further details and sources here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyNOPOL/comments/hf2iuv/are_you_a_product_of_ipb/

In these posts I give dozens of links to government reports and security agency reports from nations all over the world, some going back over 20 years. 

In the second post I expand upon my first and include several links to news reports from nations all over the globe reporting on Russian interference in elections and sowing division among their population.

If you aren't well versed on Russian IPb, they are a good place to start.

___________

**Division of the Left:**

After further research into the rising violence and confrontations in America, I believe Russia's end goal is Civil War in America.

Russia has been caught stoking the rage in both ends of the spectrum, from Antifa to White Supremacy movements.

This report by the EU discusses how Russia is currently creating and supporting online communities pushing Antifa and far left movements by pushing and amplifying police injustice, social inequality, racial issues and questioning the legitimacy of the government.

https://www.eupoliticalreport.eu/russian-connection-in-us-riots/

________ 
**Division of the Right:**


While at the same time Russia has been supporting and reigniting far right issues and supporting groups like White Pride, Tea Party, Boogaloo movement and other far right groups.

Which this University of Washington article discusses, as well as how the goal is polarization.

https://faculty.washington.edu/kstarbi/examining-trolls-polarization.pdf

___________

**Russia's Plan for Donald Trump:**

Though ultimately their support for the American Far Right is greater, as they also needed to help influence the key piece to their plan, Donald Trump.

Helping influence the American public into electing Donald Trump has been the pivotal  point in their entire plan. Without the election of Donald Trump in 2016, America likely would not be in the position it is today. His instability and ego have made him the easily manipulated tool they needed to help ensure America destroys itself from the inside out. Russia is able to manipulate Donald Trump both directly, and indirectly.

They can control Donald Trump directly, by Vladmir Putin playing as his pal. As well as the large Russian debt Donald Trump carries as they bailed out his failing businesses when no bank would touch him due to his bankruptcy of his Atlantic casinos. His debt to Russia and his fondness of Vladmir Putin allow Donald Trump to be directly controlled through direct suggestions.

This foreignpolicy.com article discussing the Russian debt Donald Trump carries.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/ 

Besides the direct control they have over Donald Trump, Russia can indirectly control him as well. Largely by playing against his ego. Through online troll accounts, they can make trending posts that inflame him, causing him to lash out and become unstable. Often attacking the ""Left"" both Democrats and movements. Donald Trump is not a man lead by logic and reason, he is a man lead by his emotions, in particular his ego, which Russia has been able to weaponize against him, as well as America.

**Setting the Stage and Possible Scenarios:**

I believe what were are witnessing is Russia pushing America towards Civil War come November 3rd.   

They are setting the stage for mass levels of civil unrest or rioting no matter what the outcome of the election.

If Donald Trump wins, there will be mass levels of protesting. Especially if there is any evidence of voter tampering. Donald Trump will likely feel emboldened by his win, if it occurs, that he will likely mobilize the military in order to quickly squash the riots. With the potential outcome of Civil War, even within the government/military itself.

If Donald Trump loses, he will likely blame voter fraud and claim the loss illegitimate. He will likely directly call on his supporters to take to the streets in protest, which will lead to protests from the left. Possibly leading to clashes. There is also a strong chance that Donald Trump will use his appointees within the Judicial Branch to rule the election illegitimate, which would likely lead to protests and rioting by Anti-Trump supporters.

Russia has already attempted to create race wars in America during the 2016 election cycle, they did not succeed. The stage seems set for them to succeed this time.

This article from the Michigan Journal of Race and Law discusses how Russia attempted to create a Race War in America during the 2016 election cycle.

**Opinion:**

I strongly believe that Russia is in collusion with China in their attempts to dethrone America as the global leader. To what level they are working together, I don't have much evidence to support, so I can not say at this time. They are largely each other's greatest ally, bonded in their distaste of America being seen as the global leader. But I believe neither wants to trust or rely on one another, their partnership is one of necessity. Russia needs China to become globally dominant so that global sanctions against Russia can be lifted. Russia's economy is currently heavily constricted by America lead sanctions against them. China needs Russia, because Russia has the espionage experience that China simply isn't creative or ingenious enough to master on their own. China's espionage is strongly tied to surveillance, information theft, and using its wealth to bribe. Russia has mastered the art of manipulation, they understand the ego of individuals in Western nations. Something China just simply doesn't grasp well, they don't understand how the West thinks, they don't understand individuality on the level we have. Russia does. Russia knows how to exploit our beliefs, ignorances, and ultimately our egos and mind. They know how to manipulate Americans, because they have been doing it since the Cold War. It is arguably their greatest strength, and I believe we may be close to achieving their greatest accomplishment, overthrowing America.

**China's Role:**

China's role in Russia's plan is simple, they see themselves as the emerging global super power of this century. It has been a plan it work for decades, and it is only accelerating. The first step was becoming the World's production powerhouse. It offered unbelievably cheap production by exploiting its workers and the environment. Capitalist Western nations could not resist in their search of ever growing profits. Hyper capitalist America was drawn in the furthest, becoming heavily reliant on cheap Chinese goods for the functioning of their society. Other nations fell for this as well, but to varying lesser degrees. 

This gave China the money they needed to move to the second stage in becoming the dominant global leader. They couldn't simply produce products designed by Western nations, they needed the ability to design and produce these products themselves. With the money the West gave China, China turned around and starting heavily funding Western institutions. Corporations, Government funded alliances, and University institutions. With these  becoming dependent on Chinese funding, they became vulnerable to Chinese bribes and data theft. China funds these institutions so that they do the research for China, and then China steals the research and intellectual property it needs to further their own research. With the end goal of China becoming completely vertically integrated in production, the ability to produce everything on its own, from the raw materials and design, to the finished product. Essentially eliminating Western countries from the process, which previously was the all important design aspect. With China producing from start to finish, it would give them an incredible amount of control over Western nations, who would be almost entirely dependent on China. The dependence on China would allow them to extract far greater profits from the West than they do now.

If you want a real world example of what China is doing, look at Amazon, which has essentially copied China's gameplan. Be unreasonably cheap by exploiting workers to centralize reliance on them, where they will then later be in the position to take full advantage of their customers.

Another key part of China's plan of becoming the new dominant global leader for this century, is their heavy investment in developing nations. Being seen as a the global leader is a pay to play scenario. Previously this role was filled by America. Which is where Russia again becomes part of China's goal. Russia helped elect Donald Trump, who views these pay to play situations as ""Bad Deals"". Donald Trump is simply too simple to understand these ""Bad Deals"" was America paying for nations to be reliant on America and retain America's global influence. Pay to play. As Donald Trump and America pulls funding from global institutions like WHO, pulls out of trade deals that would make nations reliant on America like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, as well as funding to developing nations, America is losing influence. Every time America steps back from these, China steps up. Greatly increasing it's funding to global organizations and even more so, developing countries. South America and Africa still have many developing nations. Globally speaking these two continents along with India represent the fastest growing markets. China has been investing heavily into these regions to build infrastructure, so that when they become strongly developed, they will look to China as the global leader, not America. 

Many American's tend to not take South America or Africa's development seriously. In fact, many often scoff at their importance. But their development is crucial to China's overall plan. The reason? Food. The one thing that China is currently heavily reliant on the West for, particularly America, is food. China simply doesn't have the food production to feed its 1.43 billion citizens. As it stands now, without American staple foods, China would starve. Their plan to combat this is to develop South America and Africa. Both South America and Africa have the land mass and climate to be incredibly good sources of food production. Unfortunately they are currently underdeveloped and unable to meet China's demands. Once China finishes developing these continents, they will be more than capable of supplying China with food so that it can end its reliance on America. Brazil's current destruction of their rain forest to create space for agriculture is likely evidence that my belief in this is coming true.

_________

**Conclusion/Summary:**

This was a long read, hopefully you made it this far. If you are American, hopefully you have read my views with an open mind, and carefully reviewed my sources. Hopefully it has enlightened you to what is going on in your country, who is causing it, why they are causing it, and how they are causing it. You all need to realize how you are being manipulated, and quickly change your path. There is four months until things will likely pique. If the path isn't changed, America could very well end up in Civil War, and it could even possibly trigger the Third World War. American's need to unite and realize how their government and their views are being manipulated. Vote with intention. Do not become apathetic. Get active, get informed, get involved, but do not get violent, do not get divisive. That is their goal, and it will be America's downfall if it continues. Do your part, learn about your government, at the local, state, and federal level. Don't fall for the apathy trap you're being sold that all parties are the same, they aren't. That is a lie you are told to keep you apathetic to voting. Come November 3rd, do your part. In the meantime, get involved and educate and inform others. Ignorance breeds hate, your best way to counter it is by helping your fellow Americans understand exactly what is going on. Goodluck.

Would love to hear feedback and people views on this geopolitical issue of Russia/China and the role of disinformation in the West.

**EDIT/Backstory on Putin's personal feud with Hilary Clinton:**

*Copypasta from my response to a comment about the person level politics that have influenced how this has played out*

For further backstory on why Russia and Putin is targeting America recently, and specifically Hilary Clinton previously, you have to look to Russia's Snow Revolution.

In 2011 in Russia's election, America detected what they suspected to be widespread voter fraud. Then Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, publicly remarked on this voter fraud. Which lent credibility to the internal groups within Russia who believed Putin enacted voting fraud. This kicked off a massive movement in Russia from 2011-2013 called the Snow Revolution. Which lead to the arrest and disappearance of many dissenters, political opponents, and journalists.

Vladimir Putin clearly and directly singled out Hilary Clinton and said she was responsible for this movement, and claiming she was directly responsible for supporting and funding it. Putin has a personal feud with Clinton, as he saw her as being directly responsible for the largest challenge to his power in during his reign. She was claimed to have directed a movement that saw Russia's strongman leader pushed around, by a woman. Putin could not tolerate this in public, or within the ranks of governing officials. Russia's economy is weak, and Putin must keep the image that he is a strongman with complete control of Russia, unless movements against him would build. In order to regain his image, Russia's IPb campaigns against America, but specifically the Democrats, and Hilary Clinton were put in place.

Ever since 2013, Hilary Clinton has been targeted by Russian hacking and hoaxes pushed through social media platforms. Ultimately leading up to Russian linked hacking of Clinton's emails which was a great detriment to her election campaign. Putin succeeded in interfering with Clinton's attempt to govern, much like he accused her of doing in 2011.

Some background information on the feud between Putin and Hilary Clinton.

But all these measures are useful only on a large scale.

While there are many responsible households in the US, we still lack crucial regulations in industrial sector. On the other hand China has nearly the strictest regulations in the world, but being reasonable in consumption is barely getting popular among Chinese people.

The most problematic countries both in household consumption and government regulations are India and Russia. For example, Alang is world famous ship graveyard that has been causing ecological problems for more than 3 decades. At the same time there seem to be less problematic zones in Russia. But recently one of the most popular leaders of the opposition and ecology fighters ms. Kharaidze was charged with fraud as soon as she mentioned that she is starting her campaign to enter Russian congress with the ecological party ""Green Alternative"". The appearance of the charges seems to follow the same fake scenario as in the case of the Kremlin's main critic Alexey Navalny. Which is a signal both to the fact that environment is far from the main concern in Russian politics and to the fact that ""Green Alternative"" will have to confront much larger forces than they planned. Let's wish them luck and courage.

In view with all the above, the question arises - how can we combine the ways of studying responsible consumption as well as political action worldwide? Because as we all know, there is no plan B.",Freethought,fraud

That doesn't even have any rational connection to the pretextual excuse of safeguarding against fraudulent votes. So I wonder if that part of the law could even pass rational basis review, let alone any scrutiny higher than that.

But then there are the other parts of the law, the parts that at least purport on their face to be aimed at detecting and stopping election fraud. While that may be the pretextual excuse, anyone with half a brain can tell that this is just being passed by a Republican-trifecta state in order to keep the democrats out of power. It's clearly just designed to make it logistically impossible for black citizens to vote in large enough numbers that the democrats can pose a threat.

Now, do we have any *proof* (that is to say ... evidence that will hold up in court, not just our common sense as we read the news) that the Georgia Republicans are purposefully and maliciously targeting black voters (as opposed to Democrat voters)? Probably not. However, is it really necessary for us to show said proof? I would argue that, if an election law even so much as has the *disparate impact* of discriminating against black citizens, that alone means it violates the 15th Amendment to the US Constitution.

That's how it works with employment discrimination. For example, in many federal appellate circuits, it is illegal to discriminate against an applicant for employment solely on the basis of their criminal record, because courts have recognized that such a policy has the disparate impact of disproportionately affecting black people, even though the words ""disparate impact"" never appear in the text of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If the words ""disparate impact"" don't appear in the Civil Rights Act but it's still the force of law nonetheless, I see no reason why the same logic can't also be used to incorporate a ""disparate impact"" provision into the 15th Amendment.

Would a national mask mandate hurt his chances at re-election?

Is the strategy to make this pandemic worse whilst suppressing an option to vote remotely? This way voters are disenfranchised for fear of getting sick.

This is just speculation that's been eating at me. There's enough cold hard evidence and facts displaying Trump's corruption on plenty of other matters.
