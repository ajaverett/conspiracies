Or Thanks or Tom Hanks has been Infecting just about just about every “fringe” event of sub-series of conspiracy communities. With all the hoopla surrounding him currently I wanted do dive back a couple years to some of the down right ODD things in connection with Mr Hanks.    


From the top I will mention the various point where Tom or connected parties showed up in the particular research I was doing.     
    
  First big series of hanks sync weaving was to do when I was researching the Mandela effect and the prominent position Hanks has as a Nexus of effects.      
    
  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/7lfka2/an\_exercise\_followed\_by\_examples\_word\_association/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/7lfka2/an_exercise_followed_by_examples_word_association/)    
    
  If you are unfamiliar with the Mandela effect then essentially is a a series of pop culture points that have been altered or a wide collection of people have noticed a change from their memory of a particular specific point.   


Weather or not it is faulty human memory or something else is up for debate but what is not up for debate is the rampant and creative ways the Mandela effects connect to Tom Hanks.     
    
  I made this post as a way of explaining how to play with words and symbolism, ways of looking at things as a puzzle.   


Here is a bit of what that looks like.     


Mandel means Almond, An almond is the Mandorla, Mandelas prisoner number is 46664 but used to be 4664 according to some. Cern is said to be responsible or at least involved in some way and their video “Happy” Has Both Nelson Mandela and 4664 (the occluded Prisoner number) Cerns logo has the 666 theme as well as being Mandela effected as well and the effect added a mandorla. Cern built the WWW or 666 vav vav vav 777/ which is also the Monster energy drink logo. LOGOS changing LOGOS is the WORD and the thing that was with God during creation. The levels of fractal metaphor are stunning to me. Staggeringly beautiful not just in their existence but the fact that conscious minds can behold it.   
    
   Isnt it funny that Jaws (villian) and Jaws(shark) are both to do with The mouth and teeth and the ME involves braces... And that the dolly/jaws scene had them mirror each others smiles, like in snow whites mirror mirror. and that the actress who plays dolly is Blanche Ravelec. Blanche means White/pure. As does Clarice In the Silence of the lions/lamb.... loins fruit of the womb. froot looms loony looms..... the double 00 thing oo like eyes that see.  

  
   Sally fields name is effected, her famous Oscar speech is effected, she costars in forest gump which has curious George as a key element and sally field being the one Tom hanks is quoting, he would then be involved in another ME later on. And sally fields brother works at cern... Tom hank is also Woody and Says “Theirs a Snake in my Boots” which contextually makes no sense and reminds us of the Fields not having a plural.. Another way to look at that is “Boots” could be interpreted as a word.. and the Snake is S s is a snake a snake hissessssss los of ssess lol The s on the end can also denote possession (again more S'es) possession is ownership and ownership is shackling and oppressive. You may also be reminded of Field of Dreams “If you build it THEY/HE will come (who is he?) HE is right in the middle of THEY TY thank you... and back to the start with the fact sally fields acceptance speech was her saying thank you to the academy.  


  
   This may appear to be nonsense or gibberish but if you had the time and knew the things I was referencing then you would be able to see the connections.   


Of Course this is just nothing as it is. But then the universe nods to us this genuine morsel.

The craziest part about the LHC CERN connection is that I didn't see it back when I was deeply diving into Tom hanks and the Mandela effect.  That fact came later along with this particular nugget I have seen no one reference.

My wife comes in and mentions that she got an ad for the movie Splash with Tom hanks, while I am Knee deep in looking into “Red Shoes”  


I started looking into this movie because of the notable Calling Card that Hanx has developed on twitter. He has posted pictures of lone gloves, shoes and other discarded or lost objects. Its kind of his “Thing”   


I first had this brought to my attention due too my research into the Death of Issac Kappy.  Which is another completely bonkers rabbithole that covers Epstein and leads to the death of researcher Tracey Twymin.   
    
  Kappy had called out some folks in his various videos before his death.

  Whelp this is new too me. Damn strange , The way hes propped up and the fact the time stamp in the video is 2 mins before he is noted as jumping off the bridge as there was supposedly a group of 6 or 7 teenagers on the bridge attempting to stop him.

  Tom hanks posted a picture of a discarded glove with the caption “Historic Route 66. Roadkill? I hope not! Hanx. “  


This was on 4-4-2018 and 40 days(5 weeks 5 days) before Kappys death on Route 66.  


2 posts later on the day that Kappy died Hanks posts

Make not of all of the posts made from 3-13-20 and beyond and you will see that there is a pattern to the posting style not present before.   


Before 3-11-20 he posted inside the ap using the twitter posting ap, and writing the post and attatching  a picture.   


After 3-11-20 all of his posts where he writes a blurb are pictures of text with pictures embedded

Now we are in the year of the RAT. Which is quite heavily intoned with the black plague     
    
  [https://chinesenewyear.net/](https://chinesenewyear.net/)    
    
  The phrase ""black death"" (*mors nigra*) was used in 1350 by Simon de Covino or Couvin, a Belgian astronomer, who wrote the poem ""On the Judgment of the Sun at a Feast of Saturn"" (*De judicio Solis in convivio Saturni*), which attributes the plague to a [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astrology)) of Jupiter and Saturn.    
  Hmm that is indeed interesting as I am aware that there is a Great Conjunction this very year, the year of the Rat.  And the Year of the Coronavirus.  


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_conjunction)    
    
  This conjunction is taking place on the solstice which is quite significant.   
    
  May-31-2000 was our last great conjunction and can you see how the world is so much different from that point in time. And we can suspect that this point in 2020 is yet another turning point into a “New Normal”  


Note that Dante Alighieri was very involved with astrology and had a penchant for the Great conjunctions in particular. And He was the inspiration of the movie INFERNO with Tom hanks trying to prevent a global outbreak intended to reduce  the population to save the planet.

….........................................................................................................................  
Here is a point of note. I am browsing this wiki for the first time and I am seeing this nugget.  


Pope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and [Cante dei Gabrielli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cante_dei_Gabrielli) da [Gubbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gubbio)  was appointed [*podestà*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podest%C3%A0) of the city.

Podesta really..... I had no idea this name meant anything, really never looked into it, even though I have an obsession with names and the meanings of said names, I had not sought this.

  So we have a grand convergence of coincidence. 1 with event 201 coming before HR 6201 is passed and 2 with the rummy game hanks played with his wife referencing said bill.

Look up “Baloo Mandela effect” and you'll see what I mean.  


This stood out too me because of course Tom hanks connection too the Mandela effect through notably the Most Mandela effects attributed to his name and works. But I didn't think it was 'Enough” to share here.   


So after seeing Madonna and Tom hanks connected via the Corona Typewriter I googled . “Tom Hanks and Madonna”

Tom hanks wife is Rita Wilson...................... Wilson you say?! Hmmm well the vollyball in CAST AWAY must have been named after her... right????   
    
   In the film, Wilson the [volleyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_(ball)) serves as Chuck Noland's [personifie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personification)d [friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_friend) and only companion during the four years that Noland spends alone on a deserted [island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island). Named after the volleyball's manufacturer, [Wilson Sporting Goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Sporting_Goods), the character was created by screenwriter [William Broyles, Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Broyles,_Jr.) While researching for the film, he consulted with professional survival experts, and then chose to deliberately strand himself for one week on an isolated beach in the [Gulf of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_California), to force himself to search for water and food, and obtain his own shelter. During this time, a volleyball washed up on shore. This was the inspiration for the film's inanimate companion. From a screenwriting point of view, Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue in a one-person-only situation    
     
   Here is a prime example of synchronicity that when brought up to someone not exposed to these ideas they would come back at you with “Well its prolly because his wife was named Wilson” and then the door is shut for them they don't have to take on any new ideas or modify there existing foundation of reality.  If you tell anyone a small peculiar fact then they inevitably try and “Solve” what you just told them. They have to organize the new information in a way that doesn't cause uncomfortability or stress. The human brain seems to have an Autonomic response to new information that doesn't jive with the world view that person has built up over the years.    
     
   Mention any Mandela effect and someone will try and come up with a reason to ignore what you are presenting to them. The effects themselves are in such mundane places that it doesn't seem to have much weight to the average Joe.    
     
   It seems like many people fall into the logical fallacy of the “Wisdom of the Crowd” Even if they have no concept of what this is they may still fall into its tenants.    
     
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom\_of\_the\_crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)    
     
   Take any of the biggest conspiracies out there. The moon landing, 9-11, flat earth. The bigger and more wide spanning the conspiracy then the more “Well, if this is real then people would have said something about it” “You couldn't keep a secret that big” “Somebody in my life would have told me if X was True/False.”    
   Have you seen the meme from xfiles with the poster Mulder has saying “I want to believe” with a flying saucer on it. Thats what this is like. But the train goes both ways. “I want” and “I dont want. “

   Both of these Mantras play out in our heads unbeknownst to our recognition. A duel play on what we wish reality to be and what we wish it not to be. As want and unwant are dualistic sides of the same coin.  For someone that believes 9-11 was an inside job. “I want to believe” that I among all these other people on this planet found out that this large sector of society has been duped and I am one of the few people smart enough to have figured it out.    
     
   For someone who thinks 9-11 conspiracy theorists are insane. “ I dont want to believe I have been duped by the establishment and that everything I have been taught and all the people that I love have been duped into believing an untruth.”    
     
   I think this is mainly something that stems from our human need for others to identify with and a tribe to call home. And to have our beliefs echoed by another group. To be acknowledged as a contributor to the paradigm and to feel validated by others that feel the same way.    
     
   Its like we are innately narcissistic creatures who love our own images. We find those most similar to us and we just stare at each other reflecting the same ideas and producing a greater dived between US and THEM.What it comes down to is life's great mystery. Which takes shape in questions we ask ourselves:  ” Why do I exist?” “Why is reality a thing instead of a non-thing?” “What is my purpose?”    
     
   Instead of “what is my purpose?” it becomes “Is there even a purpose?”    
     
   Mainstream elements give us Relativity, The Big Bang, and Evolution.    
     
   If a human delves into and absorbs these tenants of culture, then one may come to the conclusion that reality is the result of a freak accident of random number of infinite forces coming together and creating everything you know and love and think and do. That it is all a fluke and you are just lucky..... but luck doesn't exist because this is a random universe and nothing lies deeper than surface exploration.    
     
   To identify Self you must also have the Other. The contrast creates the existence of a thing.Imagine 2 worlds, one of infinite shadow and one of infinite light. The one of infinite shadow would be a black slate and the world of light a white slate. Without contrast everything is nothing. Sense without the lack of sense is Nonsense. A world of pure sound or silence is a world where sound isn't a thing that exists.  If you ask the question. “What is a thing” the answer would be the inverse of its opposite. What is an exhale. It is the inverse of an inhale. But what is that? It is a see saw..... seeing and after seeing sawing. SAW because it WAS. Its like pIng pOng In and Out IO overlapped is the symbol for power. On/Off.  Imagine a hero without a villain. The story of Batman is a prime example of the balancing force of the universe. Without the Joker he would have never experienced the trauma to become the batman, its very possible that if the joker had not killed his parents that he would not have had fear in the cave with the bats. Joker was the primeval creation force alchemizing the batman into existence.    
     
   And then you ask would the Joker have done what he did if he didn't have a nemesis to combat against... a force to emphasize his existence    
     
   This reality/ game seems like a puzzle of disCERNment. That the presence of so many untruths shows us the massive amounts of truths that can be yielded. The shadows can show us where the light lies.

The book is a story of a dystopian future where children are raised on video games and are chosen based on their aptitude to be brought into the military and as a part of their training they do a series of “Wargames”  via simulations systems and Haptic feedback suits for realism. SPOILER ALERT! The simulations they were performing were actual drone battle missions where they were killing actual sentient creatures.     


The psychology of getting kids to perform against actual foes with the knowledge that it was all a game made them more proficient in their duty to kill.    


Ok lets reel it back for a     
    
  TLDR.   
    
  Tom hanks is involved or a focal point in the Mandela effect phenomenon present in Forrest Gump Life is/.was like a box of chocolates, Apollo 13 Houston we have/we've had a problem, Woody from toy story says “There's a snake in my boot/s ,Momma from Forrest Gump is played by sally field/s whose name is considered a Mandela effect and has a famous Oscar speech that is commonly attributed to the Mandela effect and Sally Fields brother in real life is a scientist at CERN.

  Tom hanks then turns CERN back on after a failure that had occurred. He did this in honor of a movie Angels and Demons whos sequel INFERNO has Hanks catch a virus set to be a worldwide pandemic for the purposes of population control for the greater good. In Nov of 2019 one month before the first documented case of Novel Coronavirus Event 201 is hosted in  NYC by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. And on 3-11-2020 the same day Hanks and Rita announce they are infected with Corona virus, after bringing a Corona typewriter all the way to Australia. Then Hanks announces his wife's score of 6 games 201 points. When 6201 if you google it will get you one thing.

Hanks is called out in a video also calling out Epstein and others involved in the underground trafficking of children, This person is then killed/died/epstiened on route 66 which Tom hanks Tweets about.   


There is some funky stuff going on in the world and to be blunt there are 3 options. And then variations between those 3 options.   
    
  The extremes are   


1. This is all orchestrated and everything presented through the public is controlled/filtered and dispensed with one purpose. All news media and things that people talk about are intricately put together to share some underlying puzzle.  


Ways this could be feasible: this is a simulation and everything is preordained and put in place with no free will to the occupants in the simulation.   


Ways it couldn't be feasible. Barring a simulation it just would not cut it to have any sort of person or group in charge of such a thing, its too well orchestrated for human hands.   


I suppose a god of the realm in control of such things could perform such a feat..... but why?  


2. This is all the universe playing a coincidence game, a red herring game of sorts to keep some busy and others asleep.  Like if Tom hanks really got the itch to bring his Corona typewriter and he and his wife did actually play games of Gin Rummy that resulted in the 6 games 201 points with Event 201 being finished and HR 6201 just passing the same day they are infected with coronavirus.   


This is just one facet of the coincidental underlying tapestry that paints itself underneath human activity.   


Within this post I detail some stellar findings/coincidences that bear repeating here.

Oh yeah and the 3rd Extreme way of looking at this data I have presented here and in the past is to just shut the door and say.  


“Nothing” none of this means anything at all and you are just thinking too much or looking too deep.   


The most likely is a synergy of these 3 points. There maybe a controlling organization or AI program controlling the media and news, film and music.  But there is most likely a clever universal side of things projecting the ironic in these peculiar times. And im sure some of this is just digging to deep as everything is intrinsically connected .

1,An Analysis of Numbers used in the Bible and How they relate to Pi,256.0,j2ye24,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j2ye24/an_analysis_of_numbers_used_in_the_bible_and_how/,111.0,1601512815.0,"# Time

We are currently in an important transition period of human history as we finish out the old ways of doing, and being, and usher in a new Era of peace, love, and enlightenment. The Bible contains messages/warnings of these times, in both The Book of Daniel and Revelation. In this article, we will discuss how we have entered a final set of allotted days, the synchronistic and Divine creation of the Bible, and how it is all based upon Pi.

Daniel and Revelation both discuss certain periods of time which are supposed to take place at the end of the world's age. Daniel mentions periods such as:

* 70 weeks (broken up into 7 weeks + 62 weeks + 1 week)
* 2300 ""_evenings and mornings_"" or ""_sacrifices_"" (1150 days)
* 1260 / 1290 / 1335 days

The 7 + 62 week segment of the 70 weeks is 483 days, the [3 digit](https://oeis.org/A032510) number which takes the longest to have its first occurrence in Pi.

Revelation reiterates the relevance of the 1260 days, and refers to it in multiple ways such as by saying ""a time, and times, and half a time"" (1 + 2 + 0.5). A ""time"" is a set of 360 days, and so 360 * 3.5 = 1260. This period is also called the ""42 months"" because a prophetic month is 30 days, and 42 * 30 = 1260.

Continuing forward, the timeline is [confirmed](https://theprophetictimeline.com/tlcop_text_timeline.html) and expanded by the Mayan King [K’inich Janaab’ Pakal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%CA%BCinich_Janaab%CA%BC_Pakal), ruler of the Maya city-state of Palenque. This king dubbed himself the messenger of the time cycles and left us an important prophecy. The prophecy simply tells us that there will first be a period of 1144 years. Those 1144 years are made up of 22 cycles of 52 years. The first 13 cycles are called Heavens, and the last 9 cycles are called Hells. Then there are another 13 Heavens and 9 Hells, 22 cycles of 360 days totaling 7920 days. Then there are 40 days, then 1260 days, and finally 60 days.

Brazilian medium Chico Xavier spoke of the date 7/20/2019, which coincides with the completion of the 7920 days for our timeline.

The numbers of the prophecies work together in such astounding ways, that it seems the true intent of these messages were to give humanity insight into a timeline structure correlated with numbers based off Pi, rather than to express that an event must happen on any day.

The chosen numbers for the timeline are synchronistic. 360 is 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 and 7920 is 8 * 9 * 10 * 11.

360 is one of the ""self locating"" numbers of Pi, occurring at the end of 360 digits. Another example of the timeline's relation to Pi is that if you [sum](https://rechneronline.de/digit-sum/) every decimal digit of [Pi](https://theprophetictimeline.com/resources/pi.txt) before the first occurrence of ""7920"", you get 14159, the first five digits of Pi! It's also interesting to note that 5280, the number of feet in a mile, multiplied by 1.5, is 7920. There are 7920 inches in a furlong, and the diameter of the Earth is approximately 7920 miles.

14159 could be seen as the first prime number of Pi. Multiplying 14159 by 2 equals 28318, a number which has its first appearance in Pi at the end of 12600 digits. The 1260 days of the Bible * 10 equals this number. Then, summing those 12600 digits of Pi equals 56636 which is 14159 * 4.

When searching for a doubled prime number in Pi, 28318 (1667th prime * 2) is the first doubled prime to satisfy the fact that the digits leading up to and including its first occurrence in Pi, sum to a multiple of the prime. This is shown [here](https://pastebin.com/9D2LK4a2).

# Primer

To study some of the subjects later in this article, we will have to know the basics about some things:

The Bible is made up of 66 books. The Old Testament contains 39 books/929 chapters written in Hebrew. The New Testament contains 27 books/260 chapters written in Greek. There are 31102 verses and 1189 chapters in total.

To investigate certain subjects, we will be using the lexicon in Strong's Bible Concordance. This lexicon takes all of the original Hebrew/Greek root words of the Bible and puts them in alphabetical order. This list was originally published in 1890 by James Strong.

If you take all of the Greek root words of the New Testament and put them in alphabetical order, ""Jesus"" becomes word [#2424](https://theprophetictimeline.com/strongs?strongsnumber=G2424). The order was designed in this way because 2424 first appears in Pi at the end of 1111 digits, a very spiritually significant number.

### Gematria

Gematria is an alphanumeric code which assigns a numerical value to a name, word or phrase based on its letters. Gematria is technically a Hebrew practice, and Isopsephy is its Greek counterpart. We can use the word ""gematria"" interchangeably to describe the assignment of numbers to letters, whether they be Hebrew, Greek, or English. The method for calculating the gematria, however, will change between languages.

Let's examine the Greek word for Jesus:

    Ἰησοῦς   (Iēsous)

    Ι	Iota	10
    η	Eta		8
    σ	Sigma	200
    ο	Omicron	70
    υ	Upsilon	400
    σ	Sigma	200

    The values of each Greek letter sum to a total of 888

Jesus was the focus of the New Testament while Israel was the focus of the Old Testament. The [Hebrew word](https://theprophetictimeline.com/strongs?strongsnumber=H3478) for Israel has a gematria value of 541 which is noteworthy, as it is the 100th prime number/10th star number, and occurs in Pi directly next to 2424, the number of Jesus: `2424 541`

# 262 and the Bible

The Bible was masterfully crafted to  contain numbers relevant to Pi.

262 is a fundamental number of reality as the first 262 decimal digits of Pi, Phi, and e all sum to the same number, 1192.

The 262nd prime number is 1667 and the 1667th prime number is 14159, the first 5 decimal digits of Pi. It goes on that the number ""1667"" first occurs in Pi with a 3 immediately following it as `16673`. 262 + 1667 = 1929, and the 1929th prime number is 16673.

262 + 667 = 929, the number of chapters in the Old Testament. The New Testament contains 260 chapters, the number of days in the Mayan Tzolkʼin cycle.

Adding 929 to 260 gives you 1189, a very important number of the timeline. This will be explained further.

### 232

The 232nd prime number is 1459, and 232 + 459 = 691. The 1459th prime number is 12203.

### 17

The number 17 seems to somehow represent God, or the Divine. The first Grand Lodge in Freemasonry was founded in 1717 for this reason. Francis Bacon had a serious impact/involvement in both Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, and the number values for his name using Pythagorean Cipher (Full Reduction Gematria) are ""Francis"" (34) ""Bacon"" (17) for a total of 51. His wife's name, Alice Barnham, also sums to 51, and she was even born on 5/14/1592 (Pi = 3.141592). The base named ""Area 51"" uses this number (17 * 3) to represent the advanced capabilities of highly intelligent lifeforms, like extraterrestrials.

The 17th letter of the alphabet is ""Q"", the name of the godlike and mischievous being in Star Trek. It's also the name of the supposed military intelligence operation which has gained much notoriety, which started on 10/28/2017.

As the Bible contains 1189 chapters, it is important to note that 189 first appears in Pi at the end of 1717 digits. We also see a synchronicity take place as we raise our awareness to the fact that 189 Jesuit institutions of higher learning exist throughout the world.

From this we see the emergence of a ""Pi Code"". A hidden way to express a concept based on a number's association with Pi. As for the year of Alice Barnham's birth, 1592 is considered a special number because 7777 first appears in Pi at the end of 1592 digits. Alice Barnham's birthday month (5) multiplied by the year 1592 = 7960, or 7920 + 40 like from Pakal's timeline.

It is known well that 3.14 is equal to Pi, and such a confounding relationship presents when one observes that if you take the first 314 digits of Pi, they sum to 1392, then 1392 digits of Pi sum to 6251, a number which intersects the numbers appearing at the end of 1717 digits of Pi like so `625189`. On top of that, 6251 digits of Pi sum to 28318, a number which is well known to be the first five digits of 2Pi.

The whole of the timeline seems to boil down to a 17 in one way or another. The year the 1260 days ends is 2023, which is 7 * 17 * 17.

### Divine Construction of the Bible

We have discussed 929, 260, and 1189, as well as 17, 51, and 189, so we will now introduce 294 and 895:

294 occurs directly next to the number 895 in Pi, and these are the first two numbers to occur directly next to each other while summing to 1189. This is why the most often occurring gematria total for verses in the Bible is [895](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?reference=Exodus+6%3A10).

Another important Pi code is 691, which first appears in Pi at the end of 895 digits. The 691st prime is 5189, and 5189 first appears in Pi at the end of 1717 digits. 51 is 17 * 3 and 8 + 9 = 17. We also see that 17 * 17 is 289, which occurs at the end of 1586 digits (691 + 895 = 1586). Those 1586 digits of Pi sum to 7200, the number of days in the Mayan [calendar unit](https://maya.nmai.si.edu/calendar/maya-calendar-converter) called the ""kʼatun"".

249 first appears in Pi at the end of 294 digits, and 249 represented in duodecimal is 189. We also see that 51 digits of Pi sum to 249 and 249 digits of Pi sum to 1129, the 189th prime number.

The verse with the **largest** gematria total in the Bible is Luke 6:42, which is the 25189th total verse of the Bible. It was designed in this way because 25189 first appears in Pi at the end of 1717 digits.

According to Biblewheel's database of the original Hebrew and Greek text, there are 445797 words in the Bible. If you divide this by the 31102 verses of the Bible, you get 14.333 which is profound because 14333 first appears in Pi at the end of 1700 digits. 333 / 1700 are very important Timeline codes.

The Bible is [made up](https://www.cuttingedge.org/news/k1005.cfm) of sections of 297 or 3 * 3 * 33 chapters. Therefore 1189 is also represented as 297 + 297 + 1 + 297 + 297. The middle chapter of the Bible is Psalm 117, which is also the shortest chapter of the Bible, containing 33 English words.

Chapter #297 is 1 Kings 6:1, which discusses the building of Solomon's Temple. Interestingly, this is even the 8898th verse in the Bible, as 1931 (294th prime) + 6967 (895th prime) = 8898.

### Alignments of the Timeline

Now that we have learned some fundamental numbers, we can appreciate how they create alignments in our timeline. We'll first look at three essential dates:

* 5/14/1948 (the founding date of Israel)
* 11/12/1997 (start of the 7920 days)
* 12/21/2012 (start of the Mayan 14th baktun)

Adding 1592 days to 12/21/2012 creates an incredible alignment:

* 25189 first appears in Pi at the end of 1717 digits
* 25189 is the 2781st prime number
* 7110 first appears in Pi at the end of 2781 digits
* 11/12/1997 + 7110 days = 5/1/2017
* 5/14/1948 -> 5/1/2017 = 25189 days
* 12/21/2012 -> 5/1/2017 = 1592 days

And here's a timeline date which shows a connection between 1667 and 929:

* 5/31/2017 (start of the 1150 days)
* Adding 1667 days to this date = 12/23/2021
* This date has a Mayan long count of: 13.0.9.2.9

### 261 - 262 - 263

By observing the way that [primes sequence](https://pastebin.com/QCdrUaky) next to each other, we see three numbers stand out distinctly in decimal:

[DATA](https://theprophetictimeline.com/images/program_results.png)

Using this formula, a special balancing point takes place in the decimal numbering system in which the numbers 261, 262, and 263 seem to ""self-resolve"" or revolve back on themselves. The middle number, 262, of these perfect three numbers, is extraordinarily special because its 1667th prime number is 14159! Another interesting fact to point out is that 260 multiplied by 1.5 is 390, a number which occurs at the end of 1189 digits of Pi.

This fact may clue us in as to why the New Testament has 260 chapters. There are 260 numbers before this anomaly occurs. The numbers then run out of range, and this balancing point does not take place again in the sequence of infinite primes.

What's most interesting is the fact that the number 262 as well as 263 both hone in on the number `7920` in Pi, the number used for Pakal's timeline. Prime #262 is 1667, and prime #1667 is 14159. When you sum every digit of Pi before the number `7920`, you arrive at 14159. Including the number `7920` in your digit sum test gives you 14177. We see that 14159 is prime #1667 and 14177 is prime #1669, just as these numbers fall right next to each other in the sequence of primes.

# Timeline Fundamentals

Here is the base timeline which the Bible references with encoded numbers:

* 11/12/1997 (completion of 1144 years and start of the 7920 days)
* 12/21/2012 (winter solstice - completion of the Mayan ""13th baktun""/start of the 14th baktun)
* 5/31/2017 (start of the 1150 days / 2300 sacrifices of Daniel)
* 4/29/2018 (start of the 70 weeks or 490 days of Daniel)
* 7/20/2019 (completion of 7920 days and start of the 40 days)
* 8/29/2019 (completion of 40 days and start of the 1260 / 1290 / 1335 days)
* 9/1/2019 (completion of 70 weeks)
* 7/24/2020 (completion of 1150 days)
* 2/9/2023 (completion of 1260 days and start of the 60 days)
* 3/11/2023 (completion of 1290 days)
* 4/10/2023 (completion of 60 days)
* 4/25/2023 (completion of 1335 days)

In addition to this base timeline, there are some supplementary dates:

* 4/15/2014 (first blood moon of a tetrad, middle day of 1189 days)
* 12/26/2014 (alignment for 262)
* 10/28/2017 (start of a 1189 day period of 929 + 260 days, or 895 + 294 days)
* 7/17/2019 (date symbolic of the [crucifixion](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?reference=Matthew+20%3A19) of Jesus)
* 4/1/2020 (start of the [10 days](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?book=66&chapter=2&verse=10) mentioned in Revelation)
* 4/10/2020 (10th day)
* 4/11/2020 (completion of 10 days)
* 5/14/2020 (completion of 929 days and start of 260 days)
* 7/26/2020 (date symbolic of ""[Harvest](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?book=40&chapter=7&verse=16)"", completion of 2152 year [Zodiac Time cycle](https://theprophetictimeline.com/timeline_images/ZodiacTimeCyclesTimeline.png))
* 1/29/2021 (completion of 1189 days)

222 is an extremely relevant number of the timeline, which can be seen by the fact that 5/31/2017, 7/20/2019, and 2/9/2023, are all day 222 of the Tzolkʼin cycle (meaning these dates are all a multiple of 260 days apart). It's also interesting to point out that the 222nd prime number is 1399, and 1399 days after 11/12/1997 is 9/11/2001. 9/10/2001 was actually the last day of Coptic year 1717. We spoke of 294 above, which first occurs in Pi like this: `2294 895`. 2294 - 895 = 1399.

From 12/21/2012 to 4/25/2023 is 3777 days, which can also be represented as 1399 + 1189 + 1189.

As 4/25/2023 is also considered to be the completion of a final 1189 day period, the middle day (595th day) of that final 1189 day period is 9/7/2021, day 222 of the Tzolkʼin, and also the first day of Hebrew Civil Year 5782. (represented as 7/1/5782)

5189 - 895 = 4294, and we see that the number 294 has been revealed from this simple calculation, but there is two ways in which 4294 [relates to the timeline](https://theprophetictimeline.com/timeline_images/April_Timeline.png):

* 2708 first appears in Pi at the end of 4294 digits, like so: `2708 2668`
* 3777 first appears in Pi at the end of 14294 digits
* 12/21/2012 + 2668 days = 4/11/2020
* 12/21/2012 + 3777 days = 4/25/2023
* 4/25/2023 - 2708 days = 11/25/2015 (the 189th day of the Tzolkʼin cycle)
* 11/25/2015 is also the 5189th day of a period when 9/11/2001 is counted as day 1

Back to the number 1399: We also see that 1399 backwards is 9931, and 9931 first appears in Pi at the end of 22222 digits. 9931 is the 1225th prime like 12/25 for Christmas. The importance of the number 222 is seen in pop culture, such as in 222 Records by Adam Levine, who founded his company on 2/9/2012, a date which seems to closely resemble 2/9/2023.

9/11/2001 is an example of a date which is [not explicitly mentioned](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?book=20&chapter=18&verse=10) in the Bible, or by King Pakal, but is a date which is closely aligned with other timeline dates nonetheless. For example, 9 * 9 * 9 * 9 or 6561 days after 9/11/2001 is 8/29/2019, the start of the 1260 days. Terminator 2: Judgment Day, names the date 8/29/1997 as “Judgment Day”, a day in which nuclear destruction occurs in the movie. This date is 22 years before the actual 1260 day period.

22 is the number of chapters in Revelation, and the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet.

It is common Jewish belief that both the first/second temples were destroyed on the same day. Josephus war [Chronology](http://www.josephus.org/FlJosephus2/warChronology7Fall.html) states the following in the entry for August 29th:

>the stream of blood was more copious than the flames."" He observes that this was on the very day and month that the First Temple had been burnt by the Babylonians.

In Daniel's [7](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?versenumber=3418) + 62 + 1 weeks, he mentions a significance to the middle day (4th day) of the final week of the 70 weeks, and says that a sacrifice ceases on this day. That day which is singled out is 8/28/2019, the first day of the Tzolkʼin cycle.

Let's now review the date 7/17/2019. This date is used as [symbolism](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?versenumber=25999) for Jesus' crucifixion in the Bible because it is said that he arose in 3 days, just as 7917 is 3 less than 7920. The number 189 appears in Pi at the end of 1717 digits, and 189 days after 7/17/2019 is the start of a final 1189 day period.

We have noted 232's connection to 691. 232 first appears in Pi like so `627 232 7917 8608`. This is significant as:

* 11/12/1997 + 7917 days = 7/17/2019
* 8608 - 7917 = 691
* 7917 - 627 = 7290
* 11/12/1997 + 7290 days = 10/28/2017

We have mentioned that the founding of Israel is core to the timeline: 

* 5/14/1948 -> 11/12/1997 = 18079 days (1879 is the 289th prime number, or the 17 * 17th prime)
* 5/14/1948 -> 8/29/2019 = 50 years and 7777 days
* 5/14/1948 -> 7/20/2019 = 25999 days

25999 is a very powerful prime number, and is the 2860th prime. We see an [odd ""synchronicity""](https://pastebin.com/X0eTN32C) here as:

* 11/12/1997 + 7140 days = 5/31/2017
* 0417 occurrence #2 appears in Pi at the end of 25999 digits
* 7140 + 2860 = 10000

### Pi / Timeline Codes

666 is the ""number of the beast"", of Revelation 13:18. This is a number which points us to multiple timeline dates. 666 first appears in Pi at the end of 2442 digits. 2442 is 1221 * 2:

12/21/2012 + 2442 days = 8/29/2019, the start of 1260 days

We also see that 666 digits of Pi sum to 2961:

12/21/2012 + 2961 days = 1/29/2021, the completion of a 1189 day period which started on 10/28/2017.

* `625 189` first appears in Pi at the end of 1717 digits
* 1/29/2021 - 189 days = 7/24/2020 (completion of 1150 days)
* 625 digits of Pi sum to 2772 and 7/24/2020 - 2772 days = 12/21/2012
* 10/28/2017 + 929 days = 5/14/2020, the 72nd birthday of Israel / day 1 of the Tzolkʼin cycle
* 2701 is the gematria total for the first Bible verse, [Genesis 1:1](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?versenumber=1)
* 12/21/2012 + 2701 days = 5/14/2020

### Biblical Code Confirmation

One way we can verify the timeline is by looking deeper into the Bible verses themselves. For example:

>[Daniel 12:12](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?reference=Daniel+12%3A12) (KJV)
>Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.

In this verse, the word for ""waiteth"" is Hebrew word #2442. As a reminder, 12/21/2012 + 2442 days = 8/29/2019, the start of the 1260 / 1290 / 1335 days. We now see that 2442 and 1335 are complimentary numbers, and that 2442 + 1335 = 3777.

Daniel 12:12 also uses word #5060 which is a companion number to 4009, as they appear directly next to each other in Pi (`5060 4009`):

* 9069 occurrence #2 appears in Pi at the end of 3069 digits (those digits sum to 14159): `9069 7920`
* 9069 = 5060 + 4009
* 7920 - 4009 = 3911 (541st prime)
* 7920 - 5060 = 2860

The relationship between 2442 and 1335 is seen in other sections of the Bible as well. See these two verses:

>Matthew **24:42** (KJV)
>Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.

>Mark **13:35** (KJV)
>Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:

The verses mirror each other almost exactly and reiterate to us the fact that 2442 and 1335 are complimentary numbers of the timeline. We also see that Matthew 24:42 is the 24000th total verse of the Bible. With this verse placed at an even 1000 verses, it lends credibility to the idea that the Bible has a planned structure to show the importance of this verse. Daniel's verse was the 22094th total verse, showing the number 2294.

The Bible is strongly based off of Pi, with many of the names being derived from its numbers. The word ""Moses"" is H4872 because the number ""487"" first appears in Pi with a 2 after it like so: `4872`. From the start of Daniel's 70 weeks to the 1260 days is 487 days:

* 4/29/2018 -> 8/29/2019 = 487 days
* Finally, 4872 digits of Pi sum to 22094

This area of Pi containing 487 has many different important codes: `7848 216 829 989 4872 2658`

There are multiple interpretations for this:

* 216 (6 * 6 * 6) days after 8/29/2019 is 4/1/2020
* It can also mean 6829 days after 4/1/2020
* 4/1/2020 + 6829 days = 12/12/2038 (13.**1.6.6.7**)

There's also:

* 4/29/2018 + 487 days = 8/29/2019
* 12/21/2012 + 2658 days = 4/1/2020
* 12/21/2012 + 9487 days = 12/12/2038 (13.**1.6.6.7**)

To continue our confirmation of the 1260 days in the Bible, we see that 829 (representative of 8/29/2019) first appears in Pi like so `829 2540`. Greek word #2540 means ""time"", and is first used in this verse:

>Matthew 8:29 (1611 Authorized Version) — And behold, they cryed out, ſaying, What haue we to doe with thee, Ieſus thou ſonne of God? Art thou come hither to torment vs befor yͤ time?
>Verse #23375

The importance of this verse is confirmed by the fact that it is the first verse in the New Testament of the 1611 KJV to use the special word abbreviation ""yͤ"" which stands for ""the"". We also see the number 3375 in the total verse number, which is 15 cubed, and the sum of 761 digits of Pi - every digit of Pi before a point which contains six 9's. This area also holds 13499, the 1600th prime: `134999999`. (Side note: 40*40 or 1600 is the address of both the White House and Google. 1599 and 1601 are related numbers in Pi)

We then see that Greek word #2540 is the same word used for ""time"" in this verse of Revelation which mentions the 1260 days:

>Revelation 12:14 (KJV) — And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
>Verse #30906

A coded tweet referring to this verse was made by Trump's team, containing an RFR gematria value of 666:

>[Donald J. Trump](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1139263781144596486) - June 13, 2019
>After 3 1/2 years, our wonderful Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be leaving the White House at the end of the month and going home to the Great State of Arkansas....

The verse mentioned above contains a very major code which pertains to the 1260 days. The 1260 days are mentioned 7 times in the Bible, twice in Daniel, and five times in Revelation. The term ""[great eagle](https://theprophetictimeline.com/english?words=great+eagle)"" is used only three times in the Bible, with this verse being the last occurrence, and Ezekiel 17:3 being the first occurrence. Ezekiel 17:3 links to Revelation 12:14. Ezekiel 17:3 is marked as extremely important because it is the **only** verse in the original 1611 King James Bible to use the apostrophe (') punctuation character.

**Note:** The 1611 KJV is highly coded, and contains 2860 question marks ""?"" throughout the Old Testament, Apocrypha, and New Testament.

Ezekiel 17:3 is verse #20829, another code for 8/29/2019. If you move up 1000 verses, you arrive at verse #21829, which is Daniel 3:21, the only verse in the Bible to use Hebrew word #6361, as 6361 is the 829th prime number. If you then move up another 130 verses, you arrive at verse #21959 which is the first of two verses in Daniel which mentions the 1260 days. Another 130 verses up and you arrive at verse #22089, the second of two verses in Daniel mentioning the 1260 days.

In total you have moved up 1260 verses from Ezekiel 17:3 to arrive at the last mention of the 1260 days in Daniel. 173 is also the 40th prime, and the 40 day period ends on 8/29/2019.

### 1260 Days and 14159

The number 262 is the foundation for some of the most interesting aspects of the Pi code.

Here are the attributes of 262:

* The 262nd prime is 1667
* 262 digits of Pi sum to 1192
* 262 first appears in Pi at the end of 2039 digits

These numbers relate to the date 12/26/2014:

* 12/26/2014 + 262 days = 9/14/2015 (7/1/5776 first day of Hebrew Civil Year)
* 12/26/2014 + 1667 days = 7/20/2019
* 12/26/2014 + 2039 days = 7/26/2020 (date known as the ""Harvest"" in the Bible)

And now to include some additional understanding about the number 1667:

* 1667 first appears in Pi at the end of 10499 digits

10499 relates to other numbers through the way digits sum in Pi. These two numbers are its relators:

* 515 digits of Pi sum to 2280
* 2280 digits of Pi sum to 10499

Now for an interesting correlation:

* 12/26/2014 + 1192 days = 4/1/2018
* 4/1/2018 + 515 days = 8/29/2019
* 8/29/2019 + 10499 days = 5/27/2048
* 5/27/2048 - 2280 days = 2/28/2042

From the completion of the 1260 days on 2/9/2023 to 2/28/2042 is 6959 days. This is interesting as 14159 occurs for the second time in Pi at the end of 6959 digits.

Here is some connecting information about 7/26/2020 to tie this together:

* 1233 is a Pi code and first appears in Pi at the end of 22470 digits
* It appears like so: `2774 7 1233 88 1740`
* 12/21/2012 + 2774 days = 7/26/2020
* 12/21/2012 + 1233 days = 5/7/2016 (13.0.3.7.13)

We have come upon an interesting date here because of the fact that:

* 3713 first appears in Pi at the end of 1929 digits
* Then, 5/7/2016 -> 7/26/2020 = 1541 days

1541 is a great number of the timeline for multiple reasons:

* 1541 first appears in Pi at the end of 5280 digits
* Prime #1541 is: 12941 (294 is seen as well as the fact that 29 * 41 = 1189)
* 1541 digits of Pi sum to 6967 (the 895th prime)

On top of this, prime #12941 is 139241. Both 294 and 3924 inside these numbers are relevant as to the timeline. 12/21/2012 -> 5/27/2048 = 12941 days

To restate the importance of ""relator"" numbers in Pi:

* 5/14/2020 + 2280 days = 8/11/2026
* 11/12/1997 -> 8/11/2026 = 10499 days

### The Harvest and 17

17 * 17 is 289, and the 289th prime is 1879. It first appears in Pi with a 6 in front like this `6 1879`

This is interesting as 61879 is the 6222nd prime!

* 6222 first appears in Pi at the end of 2280 digits
* Those 2280 digits of Pi sum to 10499

One of the important dates which relate to Harvest is this:

* 12/21/2012 + [7117](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?reference=Judges+4%3A21) days = 6/16/2032
* 6222 + 895 = 7117
* The sum of divisors of 7117 is 7776
* 7776 in Octal is 17140 and in Duodecimal is 4600

Note that this number could even represent 5/31/2017 (start of the ""2300 sacrifices"").

* 7140 + 4600 = 11740 (10000 + 1740)
* 11/12/1997 + 11740 days = 1/3/2030
* 12/21/2012 -> 1/3/2030 = 6222 days

The date 4/10/2020 has an excellent connection to this date:

* 4/10/2020 -> 1/3/2030 = 3555 days

Notice that 3555 * 2 = 7110, a number we mentioned earlier in this article.

The reason these numbers have importance is because they are directly connected to 14159, or Pi.

* 1667 first appears in Pi at the end of 10499 digits: `3555 1667`

The days leading up to 7/26/2020 can be split up in many ways:

* 12/21/2012 + 1879 days = 2/12/2018 (long count has 5319, numbers in ""COVID-19"")
* 2/12/2018 + 895 days = 7/26/2020
* Or, 1375 + 1399 = 2774

### Ordered Primes

If you [order primes](https://pastebin.com/azMtDtci) based on their percentage increase from their most previous prime number, you can learn interesting things ([list here](https://theprophetictimeline.com/resources/prime_increasing_list_percentage.txt)).

Here is an example:

[DATA](https://theprophetictimeline.com/images/sorted_primes.png)

2 is the first prime on this list because nothing comes before it. 3 is the fourth item on the list because it increases 50% from 2, its most previous prime number.

When you compare this list side-by-side with the usual order of primes, you will see that summing these two numbers and searching for the first 4-digit palindromes reveals 2442 and 2772.

Genesis 1:1 totals 2701 as we have said, which is 37 * 73. Israel is also word #3478, which is 47 * 74. Then, 3478 - 2701 = 777. The 777th number on the list is 24317, which is the 2701st prime number.

777 is a relevant number of Pi for many reasons, like how:

* 7777 first appears in Pi at the end of 1592 digits
* 5903 (777th prime) first appears in Pi at the end of 358 digits
* Those 358 digits of Pi sum to 1600
* 777 digits of Pi sum to 3486, and 3486 occurs at the end of 7920 digits
* 7/17/2019 is the 358th day of the final 360 day cycle of 7920 days

Doing research into the first / last n-digit number to appear in our ordered prime list reveals:

    First n-digit nums: 2, 11, 127, 1361, 10007, 107441
    Last n-digit nums:  7, 73, 883, 9931, 99991, 999961

It's interesting to see 9931 on this list because it intersects 1600: `9931600`.

It is also interesting to note that 9931 is #5630 on this list, as it reminds me of an interesting correlation:

* 5630 digits of Pi sum to 25552
* 5/14/1948 + 25552 days = 4/29/2018

The list we have created of ordered primes seems to have an immediate connection to Pi. When the primes are concatenated with the order number of the list, we see certain numbers become visible.

1319, 1459, 1541, and 1667 stand out to me.

Some of these numbers sum to numbers which have significant connections to Pi:

* 1541 + 1667 = 3208 and 3208 first appears in Pi at the end of 879 digits
* 879 digits of Pi sum to 3911 and prime #879 is: 6829
* 2640 is 1/2 of 5280 and 1/3 of 7920
* 2640 digits precede `6829` in Pi
* 1667 + 1747 = 3414 and 3414 digits precede the first occurrence of `5280` in Pi

Moving down, 1459 and 1541 read diagonally show us 1441 and 1559 which is an alarming synchronicity as both of these numbers have a relation to the date 7/26/2020.

* 1559 appears in Pi next to 2774: `2774 1559`
* 12/21/2012 + 2774 days = 7/26/2020

The verse [Matthew 11:12](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?reference=Matthew+11%3A12) seems to confirm both the 7920 days and the date 7/26/2020.

25189 - 1717 = 23472, and Matthew 11:12 is the 23472nd total verse of the Bible. It has a gematria total of 12700 because 12700 digits of Pi precede 1112 (as in 11/12/1997). It is as so: `1441 1112`

The number 989 represents the end of an age because this number appears at the end of 1000 digits of Pi. 1000 represents completion in this sense. There are five Greek words which have a value of 989. Included are my picks for what the numbers represent:

    415     989    (4/15/2014)
    726     989    (7/26/2020)
    1112    989    (11/12/1997)
    2111    989
    3449    989

This is the first verse to use word G726. 726 + 2020 = 2746 and 2746 digits of Pi sum to 12700.

### Pi / Timeline Codes (continued)

Many numbers have dual/multiple meanings. For example, the Bible mentions the number 12000 numerous times (Revelation says that 12000 are sealed from each tribe) because 7140 first appears in Pi at the end of 12000 digits. This relates to the timeline as:

* 11/12/1997 + 7140 days = 5/31/2017

As 5/31/2017 is known for being the start of 2300 sacrifices, another relevant Pi Code is seen by the fact that Hebrew word #1818 means ""blood"". 1818 first appears in Pi at the end of 1575 digits, and those 1575 digits of Pi sum to 7140. Blood is shed when a sacrifice occurs.

It's interesting that 5/31/2017 is 780 or 260 * 3 days from 7/20/2019. Adding 780 days to 11/12/1997 brings you to 1/1/2000, the start of the new millennium. Other interesting alignments exist in the timeline as how 9/30/2019 (7/1/5780) + 1189 days = 1/1/2023.

7/26/2020 is seen as the start of the age of Aquarius. The units for these cycles are:

* 2184 days for one degree (1/360th)
* 2184 * 360 = 786240 days for one 2152 year Zodiac age
* 786240 * 12 = 9434880 days for one ""complete"" cycle ([25831](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?reference=Luke+21%3A4) years)
* 9434880 / 360 = 26208 days for one degree of a whole cycle

2184 is an interesting number which can be seen in this sequence:

`104 digits of Pi sum to 492 ... 492 digits of Pi sum to 2184 ... 2184 digits of Pi sum to 10000`

11/12/1997 + 1740 + 2184 + 2184 + 2184 days = 7/26/2020

**Highly Important Aspect of the Pi Code:**

* 2184 first appears in Pi at the end of 1740 digits
* 2184 + 1740 = 3924
* 3924 digits of Pi sum to 17916
* 11/12/1997 - 17916 days = 10/24/1948 and 10/24/1948 -> 7/26/2020 = 26208 days

We then see that 3924 first appears in Pi at the end of 7473 digits, and adding 7473 days to the start of the 7920 days gives you the date 4/29/2018, which is the start of the 70 weeks of Daniel.

##### 3911 and 3924

* 3911 first appears in Pi at the end of 3736 digits (Position 3737)
* 3924 first appears in Pi at the end of 7473 digits (Position 7474)

Note that the positions of these numbers are correlated and coordinated. The Bible confirms this concept in the [7474th verse](https://theprophetictimeline.com/explorer?versenumber=7474), which contains the first 3911 gematria total.

* 7/26/2020 + 3911 days = 4/11/2031
* 11/12/1997 -> 4/11/2031 = 12203 days (1459th prime number)
* (1740 + 2184) or (3924) + 2184 + 2184 + 3911 = 12203

### More Pi Codes

The 286th prime is 1871, and both 7/17/2019 and 7/26/2020 are the 1871st days of these respective dates:

* 6/3/2014 (13.0.**1.8.9**)
* 6/13/2015 (13.0.**2.9.4**)

2775 digits of Pi precede `1871` and 7/26/2020 is the 2775th day of the 14th baktun.

189 + 294 = 483 (the last 3 digit number to occur in Pi, appearing at the end of 8555 digits)

7/17/2019 + 483 days = 11/11/2020, a day which is 294 days from the start and 895 days from the end of a final 1189 day period.

* 1318 in Revelation 13:18 is a Pi code, as 1318 (up to 1319) digits of Pi sum to 5957
* 10/28/2017 + 5957 days = 2/18/2034 (13.**1.1.8.9**)

10/28/2017 is the start of a 1189 day period, and this particular period can be broken up into 895 + 294 days:

* 10/28/2017 + 895 days = 4/10/2020 (13.0.7.7.7)
* 11/12/1997 + 8185 days = 4/10/2020
* 8185 represented in octal is 17771
* 8185 occurrence #3 appears in Pi at the end of 10777 digits

1000 days after 10/28/2017 is 7/24/2020. We have already noted that 189 days + 7/24/2020 = 1/29/2021. 189 digits of Pi sum to 843.

* 7/24/2020 - 843 days = 4/3/2018 (13.0.5.6.9) ... 1717 first appears in Pi at the end of 569 digits
* 12/21/2012 -> 4/3/2018 = 1929 days

The total length of time from 11/12/1997 to 4/25/2023 is 9295 days. This number first appears in Pi at the end of 7715 digits like so: `2402 9295`. This is relevant because 2402 days after 12/21/2012 is 7/20/2019, completion of the 7920 days.

* 10/28/2017 + 7715 days = 12/12/2038 (13.**1.6.6.7**)
* 7/26/2020 + 7715 days = 9/9/2041 (13.**1.9.2.9**)

691 shows us two important places. 691 first appears in Pi at the end of 895 digits like `1776 691`. Its second occurrence is like this `7715 691`

* 6804 first appears in Pi at the end of 1776 digits
* 9295 first appears in Pi at the end of 7715 digits
* 11/12/1997 + 6804 days = 6/29/2016
* 107 first appears in Pi at the end of 1489 digits
* 7/26/2020 is the 107th day of a period which starts 4/11/2020
* 7/26/2020 is the 1489th day of a period which starts 6/29/2016

7/26/2020 could also represent the middle day of a 1189 day period, which would make the completion of this period 3/13/2022, 8887 days after 11/12/1997. 3/13/2022 - 895 days = 9/30/2019. 7/26/2020 is also the 117th day of a period which begins on 4/1/2020, just as Psalm 117 is the middle / 595th chapter of the Bible.

* 11/12/1997 + 7919 days = 7/19/2019
* 12/21/2012 -> 7/19/2019 = 2401 days (7 * 7 * 7 * 7)

The 1000th prime number is 7919, one less than 7920, the number we studied above. 7919 * 2 = 15838, and 15838 digits of Pi sum to 71214.

7/26/2020 has the long count 13.0.**7.12.14**

As 4/25/2023 is the completion of the 1335 days, we see that 1003 first appears in Pi at the end of 12294 digits, like so: `1003 1541`

* 4/25/2023 - 1003 days = 7/26/2020
* 7/26/2020 - 1541 days = 5/7/2016
* 7/26/2020 - 2294 days = 4/15/2014

Remember that 4/15/2014 is the first blood moon of a tetrad, and is also the middle day or 595th day of a 1189 day period. We see that 595 first appears in Pi at the end of 415 digits.

* 12/1/2015 is the completion of this 1189 day period
* 333 first appears in Pi at the end of 1700 digits
* 7/26/2020 is the 333rd day of the 1260 days and is the 1700th day of the period starting 12/1/2015
* 12/1/2015 -> 7/20/2019 = 1327 days

771 digits of Pi sum to 3449. 7/26/2020 is the 771st day of 6/17/2018 (the 62 week segment), and the 3449th day of 7/26/2020 is 1/3/2030.

To relate 6/29/2016 to Pi again, we see that 552 first appears in Pi at the end of 1665 digits:

* The 552nd day of 12/26/2014 is 6/29/2016
* The 1665th day of 12/26/2014 is 7/17/2019

### Fun Facts

* 5/14/2020 + 5280 days = 10/28/2034
* 11/12/1997 -> 10/28/2034 = 13499 days

The word ""giraffe"" is loved by occultists, as the numbers of it show:

7/17/2019 is both the 7918th day of one period of time and the 1665th day of another.

# 1189 Day Periods

* 9/19/2009 (7/1/5770) -> 12/21/2012 = 1189 days
* 8/29/2012 -> 12/1/2015 = 1189 days (4/15/2014 is middle day)
* 10/28/2017 -> 1/29/2021 = 1189 days
* 9/10/2018 (7/1/5779) -> 12/12/2021 = 1189 days (middle day or 595th day of this period is 4/26/2020, the 117th day of the year)

3,The Law of One,143.0,l0xmdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/l0xmdh/the_law_of_one/,61.0,1611103313.0,"The Law of One comes from the Ra Material, a series of conversations between Don Elkins, a physicist, pilot, and UFO investigator, and Ra, a multidimensional being who spoke through Carla Rueckert, a psychic, medium, and Don Elkins’ life partner. It was channeled in the 1980s. Some of the topics discussed include physics, philosophy, cosmology, spirituality, mathematics, and humanity’s hidden history. The language used in the material is highly sophisticated and precise. One scholar even compared it to a PhD dissertation on epistemology.

https://www.lawofone.info

In the material, Ra states the Law of One, though beyond the limitations of name, may be approximated by saying that all things are One, that there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is One, and that One is the Infinite Creator. Ra claims that this universe, which is actually one of many, was created by the One Infinite Creator by distorting himself/herself through the creation of free will, love, and light. Supposedly, all things come from an interaction of these three distortions.

Ra also describes each galaxy as being a creation of an intelligence called a Logos. Logoi create sub-Logoi, or stars. For example, our sun would be considered a sub-Logos. Each sub-Logos is responsible for the unique archetypes experienced by the beings in that solar system. The archetypes humans resonate with are influenced by the signs of the zodiac, which are determined by our sun’s location in the universe. Ra claims these archetypes were encoded into the Tarot system long ago, which actually originated on Ra’s home planet, Venus. According to Ra, the Tarot system was originally used by Ra’s race to study their own spiritual progress. However, it was later introduced to ancient Egypt when Ra visited Earth to aid humans in their cosmic evolution. It eventually became the deck of cards we see today.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot#History

Supposedly, Ra also had a hand in building some of the pyramids. According to Ra, the Great Pyramid was meant to be used by humans for healing and initiatory work. Those who wish to become purified or channels for the Law of One can use it for these purposes. However, Ra’s teachings have since been distorted by humans and this is why Ra attempted to make contact with us again around 40 years ago. Ra’s main concern is helping humanity transition to the next density, or the next level of consciousness.

According to Ra, there are 8 different levels of consciousness, or densities. The first density is associated with the elements, like earth, air, water, and fire. The second density is associated with organic life, like bacteria, plants, and animals. Humans are supposedly third density beings, the level of consciousness associated with self-awareness and duality. However, we are in the process of evolving into fourth density beings, the level of consciousness associated with love and understanding. The fifth density is associated with light and wisdom. The sixth density is associated with wholeness and the uniting of opposites. It is a level of consciousness that sees beyond good and evil. It is supposedly the density archangels come from. The seventh density is the last level beings reach before merging back into the One. And the eighth density is the beginning of the next octave, where the journey starts all over again. Beings evolve by practicing the Law of One through Service to Self or Service to Others.

Some might perceive beings who have chosen the path of Service to Self as evil. Their purpose in this universe is to dominate and enslave. Supposedly, The Orion Group is made up of these beings, and they’re responsible for many of the UFO abductions and cattle mutilations. However, Ra says there are also beings from higher densities who have chosen the path of Service to Others that are incarnating as humans on Earth to aid us in the transition to fourth density. Ra calls this transition the Harvest, and it supposedly began sometime around 2011. Ra claims to be a sixth density being. Supposedly, at this stage of cosmic evolution, planetary civilizations merge into one unified consciousness, something Ra calls a social memory complex. This gives each entity in that civilization access to all the knowledge of that planet.

While all this sounds absurd, many ideas in the Ra Material seem to be reiterated in other channeled works. For example, Ra acknowledges the existence of The Nine, a group of extraterrestrials Andrija Puharich, a medical inventor and physician, claimed to contact in the 1950s. Oddly enough, Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, claimed he channeled a collective of entities who called themselves the Council of Nine while creating the legendary television series. Coincidentally, the Council of Nine is also a group of gods in Greek mythology. Ra also claims to be part of the Confederation of Planets, a group of beings who work in service of the Infinite Creator. This name is similar to the Galactic Federation, a group of extraterrestrials the former Israeli space security chief recently claimed to be in contact with.

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weird-news/former-israeli-space-security-chief-says-extraterrestrials-exist-trump-knows-n1250333

The Ra Material also seems to reiterate the findings of other occult researchers. For example, the mathematician, inventor, and personal astrologer of Queen Elizabeth I, John Dee, claimed he contacted angels who told him Earth was quarantined from the rest of the universe. Ra also says Earth is quarantined until humans reach spiritual maturity. Oddly enough, Ra claims the beings enforcing this quarantine live in the rings of Saturn. This seems to back up the conspiracy that Saturn is somehow keeping humanity trapped in a kind of pocket dimension.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke#Conspiracy_theories (scroll down to Saturn—Moon Matrix)

Some ideas presented in the Ra Material also seem to be depicted in the Disney movie Soul. New souls are imprinted with archetypes, the soul who refuses to go to Earth is named 22 (the number Ra associates with Tarot), and the Jerrys are reminiscent of a sixth density being. However, if you’re a Christian, you might be skeptical of channeled works because the Bible says to turn away from psychics and mediums. Is the Ra Material one of the doctrines of devils Saint Paul warned about? Was Soul disinfo? Or was it a work of art that revealed hidden truths?

**“Art intuitively apprehends coming changes in the collective unconscious.”**

**— Carl Jung**

Nevertheless, I believe the Ra Material will become more relevant as the world continues to become stranger and stranger. If you’d like to learn more about the Law of One, I recommend watching Brian Scott and Aaron Abke on YouTube or following @TheLawofOne_ on Twitter. Thanks for reading!

4,Astrological information on dates that may be significant to us conspiracy-minded folks,119.0,j4bk10,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j4bk10/astrological_information_on_dates_that_may_be/,65.0,1601709453.0,"Hey, hoping that this type of post is allowed. If not it's ok & I totally understand!

Anywho, I'll cut right to the chase: I study astrology and am working towards becoming a licensed, practicing astrologer. I've been paying *very* close attention to the news being shared in this sub, and the timing in relation to the stars. It's all very much connected, so I wanted to share some upcoming dates that we should pay close attention to. Here they are:

• **October 9th**: Mars/Pluto square. This is a 90° alignment that basically translates to challenging, dramatic energy. A good example of how the square aspect affects us is the presidential debate: It happened *during* a square between Mars and Saturn. The last time this happened between Mars and Pluto was August 13th, although I don't recall what was going on then. There will be a third square on December 23rd. Historically, Mars/Pluto squares have been triggers for natural disasters--we could see earthquakes, floods, perhaps even mire wildfires. (The last time this square happened my phone broke that very day too LOL)

• **Oct.18th**: Mars/Jupiter square. I think this is going to be a big one. I can tell you all that the last time there was a Mars/Jupiter square, was the exact same day of the explosion in Beirut. That week was also the last time the Pentagon released any information related to UFOs. I suspect that both Beirut/middle-Eastern affairs & UFOs are on the table for being relevant later this month. Maybe something else will happen, maybe we will just get more details on what happened back then.

•**Oct.14th through election day**: Mercury retrograde in the sign of Scorpio. I'm sure you've all heard of Mercury retrograde at some point or another. Mercury rules communication & information, so when it goes retrograde, those things tend to get wonky. In astrology, each zodiac sign is ruled by at least one planet--Scorpio is ruled by both Mars and Pluto, and this is the sign Mercury will be in during the retrograde, which conviniently ends on election day. And, as I mentioned before, Mars and Pluto will be arguing in the heavens early this month. Thus, their challenging energy will be fueling Mercury, and making communication even more stressful leading up to the election. We can see this crystal clear right now, and it's only going to get weirder.

•**Halloween**: A Full Blue Moon in Taurus, forming a conjunction to Uranus. This Full Moon will be the second of the month--the first happened on the night of 10/1, which was when Trump announced via Twitter that he apparently tested positive for the 'rona. Uranus is the planet of surprises, chaos, and innovation...when it gets involved, expect the unexpected. When it gets involved on Halloween during a blue moon, in midst of all this other energy, *really* expect the unexpected.

• **December 21st**: Fast-forwarding to the winter solstice, this day will arguably kick off the most significant energy of the year, during a grand conjunction between Jupiter and Saturn. This aspect happens every 20 years, but this one has a twist--it is happening in the sign of Aquarius. What makes that special is the fact that for centuries, these 20-year cycles have been lining up in Earth signs; that is, Taurus/Virgo/Capricorn. This year begins a new *several-century-long* cycle, where every 20 years the two planets will be meeting in Air signs, as opposed to Earth. Those are Aquarius/Gemini/Libra. One day, almost the entire solar system will be lining up in Libra...I believe this is far after our time though, something like 2350 haha.

Anyways......I just wanted to provide these dates and a little context. Let me know what you think will happen in the comments. I know that a lot of stuff to do with global pedophilia also coincided with astrological goings-on, in addition to the scamdemic and basically every single other big thing we've talked about on r/conspiracy. I really have been paying attention, personally it helps keep me sane during these wild times. And I can tell you all with certainty: We ain't seen nothin' yet.

If anyone wants to know more, please feel free to ask. I have only scratched the surface, because this subject is truly a bottomless rabbit hole. Thanks for reading if you made it this far!

***TL;DR: Mars and the outer planets are causing a ruccuss this month, affecting everything from Covid to election day and beyond. Pay attention to October 9th, 14th, 18th, 31st, and especially pay attention to December 21st through Christmas. The heavens are shifting in major ways, and we will notice. I cannot & will not tell you what is going to happen with certainty--I can only tell you that the craziest of 2020 is yet to come. Good luck & stay strong!***",conspiracy,Zodiac

2. My mother was diagnosed with DID as a teen in the 70s and she was in and out of a lot of state funded mental heath institutions during that period.

She now claims that she believes she was experimented on at that time. I’ve always discredited her, but upon researching it more...I’m disturbed to say her claims may not be that out there.

I witnessed her randomly disassociate and tune in and out of many different personalities on many occasions growing up.

I saw a video of Britney Spears doing it in an interview and it was VERY VERY similar to that, so much so that I even sent it to my sister to confirm and she agreed. It was terrifying having to deal with this growing up and nothing about it seemed natural to my sister and I as kids.

I also have one particular TDV subscriber in the Czech Republic who parses through a lot of this data for me…
and what we have been uncovering about some sort of event on August 10th/11th is at least worth mentioning
here. If something of interest does happen on this date then at least I can say I tried to tell you. And, if
nothing happens, much of this information is interesting nonetheless.

TISHA B’AV

Tisha B’Av, the 9th day of the month of Av, which is the 11th month in the Jewish calendar (in Europe they
would write this date as 9.11., this year 2019 in Gregorian calendar TISHA B´AV falls to August 10-11), is the
saddest day in the Jewish calendar, on which the orthodox jews fast, deprive themselves and pray.

It is the culmination of the Three Weeks (of mourning), a period of time during which we mark the
destruction of the two Holy Temples in Jerusalem, the Solomon’s temple by the Neo-Babylian empire in 587
BC and Herod's temple by the Roman empire in 70 AD.

It is crucial to note that this world is run by secret societies and at the very hard core of the secret societies is
the Kabbalah. Kabbalah is the ancient jewish mysticism. It is a method of encoding information through a
system of mathematics and numbers. It is some of the most ancient knowledge that man has ever possessed
and has been kept secret and given only to those who proved themselves worthy through the process of
initiation.

Nobody today really knows where it comes from, it was here a long time before the jews came along, the jews
just took it and preserved it. It truly is the hardcore of the secret knowledge, the metaphysics, the science that
not even 0.1% of the today´s world population know anything about,

Shortly to the symbol 911 and what it means in Kabbalah; Tisha B'Av is actually the Ninth of AV, the 9th day
of the 11th month in the jewish calendar. In Kabbalah number 10 is the symbol of God's perfection and
superiority.

The satanists (what the people at the highest ranks of the secret societies like freemasons are) are literally
very afraid of God, so they do everything to escape God’s supervision over their deeds , try to hide from Him
and that is why they have this symbol 9 11 as the most satanic one, since they believe this symbol kind of
“jumps over” or “skips” God, since God’s symbol of perfection and superiority in Kabbalah is the number 10.

They jump over the number 10 or try to skip it, that is why 9 11… the Tisha B´Av holiday of the jewish
calendar falls into the second half of July or first half of August in the Gregorian calendar.

Some of the events that took place on Tisha B´Av in history:

● The First Crusade officially commenced on August 15, 1096 (Av 24, AM 4856), killing 10,000 Jews in
its first month and destroying Jewish communities in France and the Rhineland.
● The Jews were expelled from England on July 18, 1290 (Av 9, AM 5050).
● The Jews were expelled from France on July 22, 1306 (Av 10, AM 5066).
● The Jews were expelled from Spain on July 31, 1492 (Av 7, AM 5252).
● Germany entered World War I on August 1–2, 1914 (Av 9–10, AM 5674), which caused massive
upheaval in European Jewry and whose aftermath led to the Holocaust.
● On August 2, 1941 (Av 9, AM 5701), SS commander Heinrich Himmler formally received approval
from the Nazi Party for ""The Final Solution."" As a result, the Holocaust began during which almost
one third of the world's Jewish population perished.
● On July 23, 1942 (Av 9, AM 5702), began the mass deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto, en
route to Treblinka.
● The AMIA bombing, of the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, killed 85 and injuring 300 on
July 18, 1994 (10 Av, AM 5754).
● The Israeli disengagement from Gaza began in the Gaza Strip, expelling 8000 Jews who lived in Gush
Katif; August 15, 2005; 10 Av, 5765.
● Last year 2018 on Tisha B´Av on July 21st, we had a shooting in Chicago. It happened at 10:30am
when the arms of the clock point at 11 and 6, the upside down 911.

Tisha B´Av this year is the numerical value of the number 58, 11+8+20+19, 58 is very symbolic number for
freemasonry and other occult or secret societies. Donald Trump is also connected to this number, we will
devote some attention to this number with relation to Donald Trump later below, furthermore the word
TRUMP equals 222 in „reverse satanic“ style of gematria. August 10th is the 222nd day of the year.

Moreover, some numerologists are saying that the most satanic day in the year from the number point of
view is June 6th, like 6/6. For example, last year the merger of the two giants, Monsanto and Bayer , deal for
$66 billion USD, was allegedly signed on 6/6/18 (18=6+6+6). Now if you add 66 days to 6/6 (June 6th),
you’́ll come to August 11th, TISHA B´AV of 2019.

This year we had a ritual on 6/6, with all the world’s (mis)leaders in Normandy, France, the 75th anniversary
of the Normandy landing of the allies in 1944. On CNN they put some headlines in quotes, like “NORMANDY
ANNIVERSARY” which equals 222 in ALW Kabbalah style of gematria (the beginning of Tisha B´Av this year
is in the evening of august 10th, the 222nd day of the year). They also posted, “NORMANDY D-DAY” which
equals 118 in both ALW and KFW Kabbalah styles of gematria. Maybe they are pointing to august 11th as
much as they can, since 11.8. is the way August 11th is written in Europe.

AUGUST 11TH

The date 11.8. is also like 11+8 = 19, we are in the year 19, 19 matches CHAOS is gematria, in reverse it is 91,
matching PHOENIX.

It is also like 11x8=88, which is the symbolic number of Trump, in other words the “super time number.”

The number 11 in Kabbalah is representing duality, shattering and the initiation into the mysteries of religion.
September 11th was permeated by the number 11 like no other event in known history. 11 is also represented
by the twin pillar of Jachin and Boaz, which stood at the entrance of Solomon’s temple. Number 11 and its
multiples are the master numbers in numerology, they do not get reduced unlike the other numbers, which
can be reduced.

The number 8 is the number of time, represented by the hour glass, the infinity symbol and the Ouroboros
biting its own tail. Number 8 is also the symbol of the Magician tarot card, the Magician is always depicted
with the number 8 above his head and with the hourglass on the table in front of him.
1+1+8+2+0+1+9=22

22 is the “master builder number”, freemasons consider themselves to be THE MASTER BUILDERS. Also,
there is 22 books of revelation, this date august 11th seems to be very much entangled with eschatology or the
end times.

Haarp’s patent day is August 11th 1987. It will be exactly 32 years on august 11th 2019. The 32nd degree is the
highest degree of initiation of the Scottish rite of freemasonry, the most used rite among the Jewish
freemasons. It has 33 degrees, but the 33rd degree is the so called “honorary degree”, the masons in the 33rd
degree are bestowed this kind of degree as a credit for what they have done for freemasonry in their life or
even after they die. No higher initiation into any more “sacred knowledge”, the highest degree of initiation is
the 32nd degree.

The formation of AL-QAEDA was on 11.8.88 (1988). This year on August 11th 2019 it will be exactly 31 years.
31 is the 11th prime number and also 13 in reverse, 13 is the biblical number of rebellion.
AL-QAEDA matches 58 in gematria (words matching this number will be named later on) and also 888 in
gematria, matching DONALD J TRUMP, EMMANUEL MACRON, JESUS CROSS, DEUTSCHE BANK

Also, 11.8, 1919 the new German constitution was adopted, founding the Weimar Republic. This act lead
Germany shortly after the first world war and a downwards spiral of hyperinflation, consequently into a nazi
overtake, and ultimately into the second world war.

DONALD TRUMP

With the connection of building the third temple in Jerusalem at this time, the third year of the reign of
Donald Trump as the new “King Cyrus” (the third year of the reign of King Cyrus is being described in the
bible), and along the fact this year being very, very important for the satanic rulers on its own, this year
TISHA B´AV on August 10th-11th 2019 seems to be a quite probable date for some kind of event of 911
importance.

The state of Israel just celebrated its 71st anniversary on May 14th this year. 88 days later we´ll come to
August 10th, the beginning of TISHA B´AV. 88 is the symbolic number of Trump (the re-incarnated King
Cyrus):

● Trump spent 88 million USD of his own money for his campaign
● Trump had 88 offices across the US during his presidential campaign
● Trump had 88 events or campaign stops during his campaign
● Trump had the number 88 on his podium everywhere he spoke during his campaign
● Trump had 88 military advisors, retired admirals and generals who supported him in his campaign
● Trump’s slogan “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” equals 808 in numerology. For those who missed
Christine Lagarde’s lecture on numerology, zeros are ignored in numerology
● Trump’s slogan “STRONGER TOGETHER” equals 88 in two gematria styles
● Trump’s cousin Thomas P. Trump , due to which Donald Trump was being mocked during his
campaign, died exactly 1 year before Trump's inauguration day, 20. January 2016, 88 days before he
would be 88.
● The movie Donnie Darko, predicting Trump's victory, where the main character kind of symbolizes
Donald Trump, and the movie talks about time travel and the year 1988, is overloaded with the
symbology of the number 88
● The word “Trump” matches 88 in gematria in the „english ordinal“ style, the most basic numerology
style, where A = 1 and Z = 26, DONALD J TRUMP equals 888 in english-sumarian style of gematria
● Trump’s mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, died when she was 88 years and 88 days old

Donald Trump, in esoteric circles, is always compared to King Cyrus, or Cyrus the Great, the king of Persia,
who released the Jews from the 70 years of captivity in Babylon, gave them back the city of Jerusalem and
built a wall around it. Netanyhu even compares Trump to Cyrus.

When Trump was selected the US president, the state of Israel started minting coins with the king Cyrus and
President Trump together on one coin.

If we just for a while accept the notion that Trump is the reincarnation of the King Cyrus, (now taking into
account the fact they truly look alike…), we should also look at some potential other connections and
similarities between these two leaders and maybe try to make some predictions of what might be happening
in the near future…

Now let’s look at the bible, New King James Version, Daniel 10:

Daniel 10 New International Version (NIV)

Daniel’s Vision of a Man

10 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel (who was called
Belteshazzar). Its message was true and it concerned a great war.[a] The understanding of the
message came to him in a vision.

2 At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks. 3 I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my
lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.

So now we are in the third year of Donald Trump (reincarnated Cyrus the Great???) presidency, who is
compared to King Cyrus in many esoteric and historic aspects, and we are nearing the “three weeks of
mourning.”

The three weeks of mourning are between the 17th of Tammuz (when the walls were broken down, the breach
was made, when they were coming over to take over the temple and siege Jerusalem) and Tisha B´Av (the
destruction of the two temples, Solomon’s temple and Herod's temple), meaning this year, 2019, between
July 21st and August 11th in the Gregorian calendar.

August Eleventh is like 11.8.2019, or 11+8+20+19=58. 58 is the number very much connected to the
freemasonry other occult or secret societies.

Let's look at some words matching the number 58 in numerology: JERUSALEM, THIRD TEMPLE,
SOLOMON’S TEMPLE (the 1st temple that got destroyed on Tisha B´Av), HEROD'S TEMPLE (the 2nd
temple that was destroyed on Tisha B´Av), RED HEIFER, FREEMASONRY, ROSICRUCIAN, SECRET
SOCIETY, SCOTTISH RITES, DOLLAR

It is important to note that Donald Trump won the 58th presidential election in the USA, his inauguration
date was 20.1.2017, 20+1+20+17=58, Trump Tower has 58 floors. Trump announced he would be running for
candidacy from the 58th story of the Trump Tower. August 11th is 58 days after Donald Trump’s birthday
(June 14th).

Donald Trump was in Israel at the exact place where they plan to build the third temple, on May 22nd 2017
(another very ritualistic day for the freemasons), exactly 811 days before 8/11, or august 11th 2019.

PREDICTIVE PROGRAMMING

THE SIMPSONS:

The episode “APOCALYPSE COW,” quite clearly symbolizing the RED HEIFER, (154 in gematria, matching
TEMPLE MOUNT, RITUAL SACRIFICE).

RED HEIFER, which birth was announced by the Temple institute in Israel on September 4th 2018, a day
that leaves 118 days till the end of the year, later was celebrated in Israel on 9/11/2018. The date the Red
Heifer was actually born is reportedly on August 28th 2018. August 28th 2018 is like 28.8./2018, or
2+8+8=18, 1+8=9, then the year 2018 is like 2+0+1+8=11, so hidden 9/11 in the date of the Red Heifer’s
birth.

The birth of the red heifer is a biblical sign of building the third temple, the third temple should be built at the
time when the MESSIAH comes back to planet earth, the messiah is said to come back “through the Golden
Gate”.

The Simpsons’ “APOCALYPSE COW” is the episode 17, Season 19 (season 19, do they point to the year 19???
btw. „AUGUST 11“ is 19 in gematria matching CHAOS, and also equals 91 matching PHOENIX), episode 17
(1+7=8, do they point to the 8th month of the “season” or year 19?).

“Apocalypse Cow” came out on April 27, 2008.

2008 was a leap year, so April 27th was the 118. (11.8.) day of the year.

Again, it is 11 years ago when this cartoon was put out…

THE GRIM REAPER

There is a video of Grim Reaper standing in the dress of Satan next to the San Francisco Golden Gate bridge,
nicely done predictive programming, this video came out July 24th 2018, exactly 1 year and 18 days before
August 11th 2019. 1 year 18 days. We are dealing again with the predictive programming of 118…

PACIFIC RIM

In this movie, which is all about a tragic events and the main one is the destruction of the GOLDEN GATE
BRIDGE IN SANFRANCISCO, it shows on the scene when the bridge is being destroyed the date August 11
2013, at 9:32am (923 and its variations are the new satanic code for some kind of tragedy events). Maybe just
a coincidence…

SAN FRANCISCO GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE

It is said that the “third temple” should be built at the time the Messiah comes back. Also, the story says that
the Messiah will come back through the “Golden Gate”. The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco kind of
shares the name with the Golden Gate in Jerusalem. That is the eastern gate of the Temple Mount, where a
divine presence used to appear and will appear again, when the Messiah comes, and a new gate replaces the
present one.

It is important to note that Donald Trump won the 58th presidential election in the US, but is actually the
45th president of the US, since some presidents made two terms.

Let's look at some word or word connections having 45 in gematria:

GOLDEN GATE, HOLY BIBLE, BRIDGE, MIKE PENCE, BITCOIN

Now the current mayor of San Francisco is the 45th mayor of San Francisco, and she is turning 45 years old
on August 11th 2019. Her name is London Breed.

Lets look at the gematria of her name:

LONDON BREED 54 (45 in reverse), 317 matching SATURN, MESIAH, BITCOIN, 216 (6X6X6), 33

The construction of the Golden Gate Bridge started on January 5th, 1933. 1/5/1933 is like 1+5+19+33=58

NUMEROLOGY

It is important to note that numerology belongs to the esoteric science by which all the secret and occult
societies are literally obsessed! Next to the geometry or mainly sacred geometry and architecture, math,
astrotheology, it is fair to state that numerology is probably the most important one of all of the teachings in
all of the mystic schools.

It is not the right time now to explain why it is so, it is just important to note that it is a fact. The cabalists and
high ranking members of secret societies are convinced that words with the same numeric values are having
some kind of interconnection or kind of the same vibrational frequencies and therefore kind of a same
meaning or purpose in this material world, or the matrix we are living in. The core of numerology is that
these people believe that God created the world by merging the letters with the numbers and vice versa.

So, let’s get technically into it and see some other correlations and predictive programming, since we know
very well that the powers that should not be, according to the cosmic rule, HAVE TO ANNOUNCE THEIR
PLANS IN ADVANCE, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT COME TO FRUITION! If we are really talking about
some event on a biblical scale, that could really be called 911 2.0, there really has to be something for those
who have “eyes to see and ears to hear…”

August 11th 2019 is like 11+8+20+19 = 58

Let’s look at some words matching the number 58 in numerology: JERUSALEM, THIRD TEMPLE,
SOLOMON´S TEMPLE (the 1st temple that got destroyed on Tisha B´Av), HEROD’S TEMPLE (the 2nd
temple that was destroyed on Tisha B´Av), RED HEIFER, FREEMASONRY, ROSICRUCIAN, SECRET
SOCIETY, SCOTTISH RITES, DOLLAR, GREGORIAN, CALENDAR, ZODIAC, STARS

This year the most significant freemasonic ritual was undoubtedly the burning of Notre Dame. Interestingly,
the 15th of april, this ritualistic day, is exactly 118 days before August 11th, or before 11.8. Coincidently, april
15th, 15.4.2019 is like 15+4+20+19=58, the same value as August 11th 2019.

There was also one other satanic ritual this year, the so called “Christchurch shooting.” It happened on the
15th of March 2019. The zip code for Christchurch is 8011 (8/11). Interestingly, 2 mosques were attacked by
the shooting as well as two temples were destroyed on Tisha B´Av. Coincidently the word connection
CHRISTCHURCH SHOOTING is 118 in „jewish reduction“ style of numerology.

The Christchurch shooting happened on 15.3.2019 , it is like 15+3+20+19=57, the same as August 10th, or
10.8.2018, which is like 10+8+20+19=57, some other words matching 57 in numerology: JEWS, MOON.

11th of August is the 223rd day of the year. 223 is the symbolic number of SKULL AND BONES.

There are some words and word connections matching 223 in gematria:

THE SYNAGOGUE OF SATAN, MASONIC, GOLD AND SILVER STANDARD, GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE,
NATURAL DISASTER, SAN FRANCISCO BRIDGE, LET HIM WHO THAT HATH UNDERSTANDING
COUNT THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST.

On May 14th, 2019, the state of Israel has celebrated the 71st birthday. Words like TEMPLE, TALMUD equals
71 in numerology. May 14th is the 134. day of the year.

Some words matching 134 in numerology: TISHA B´AV, NINTH OF AV (the same as TISHA B´AV),
NETANYAHU. From august 11th till the Netanyahu’s birthday on October 21st is exactly 71 days.

The major satanic ritual of this century was undoubtedly 9/11, or September 11th, 2001. From that day till
August 11th 2019 it is exactly 17 years and 11 months. In numerology, the master number 11 and its multiples
do not get reduced, the other numbers can be reduced. 17 years and 11 days. 1+7/11 is like 8 and 11 to the day
8/11. The word DEATH equals 118 in “JEWISH” style of gematria.

222

CONCLUSION

You may have read all that and just think I am crazy. But there are a lot of people who put a lot of work into
decoding these things and it is very interesting information.

So, will something major occur on August 10th or 11th? And, if so, what will it be?

I’ll leave that up to you to ponder on but there is enough evidence pointing to those dates that I felt I should
at least make you aware of it.

Other dates that have similar programming include September 23rd and/or November 23rd. I’ll keep an eye
on those dates as well but we are thinking those dates are more likely to be of importance in 2022 or 2023.

This is all just information. Do with it what you wish. But, as I said, at the very least it is very interesting!

8,Black Mold: Parafungal Activity,100.0,w1ett0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/w1ett0/black_mold_parafungal_activity/,58.0,1658084922.0,"Kind of a follow up to a previous post I made on fungal hacking, and a cross-post from my community. But I think enough people were interested so here is one more specific on black mold and the subsequent invention of the 'paranormal' and supernatural which are conceptions based on the fear and consequences of black mold toxicity that humans have faced since we created the situation for them to grow in, cellulose rich houses, hidden from the sun.

The video is just me talking with the below info. I know this is a word heavy post so some might find it easier to listen. It's just a complex subject that people have relatively little knowledge of, for the most part I'd say. People on here seem pretty conscious of their health and spirituality and I want to present my research on this that you may find helpful, life-changing or just something interesting to ponder.

This is in good faith, I am not intentionally making anything up without at least a decent amount of research and thought put into this. I think I'm more or less right, which wildly changes our understanding of a lot of things. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwnuKDorjtI&ab\_channel=fishinginspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwnuKDorjtI&ab_channel=fishinginspace)

(More or less the script I used, the video is the same, just worded a bit differently and perhaps more elaborative, whatever your preference, should be the same information.)

Black mold, or stachybotrys chartarum is an ascomycetes microfungi that produces slime heads and usually grows in wet cellulose rich building material and interestingly enough, its actually uncommon in nature, found sometimes in soil and grains. In fact this kind of fungus is probably only relevant because of human homes. Black mold is actually a variety of several types of household molds, though chartarum is the typical mold associated with 'black mold'.

Science has a very limited understanding of the effects of black mold and the most accepted symptom is lung bleeding. However we do know that it is a mycotoxin, which just means it produces harmful toxins to humans, plants and animals.

The list of possible links to disease is practically endless, yet science has had trouble pinning anything specific, it is too dependent on a variety of factors because there are so many different types of molds as well as each person responds differently.

We do know that mold can affect the brain in various ways and it would be difficult to trace it to mycotoxins because they could be damaging your body without any detection unless you're specifically testing for it, the point of this is so you can get a good understanding of black mold.

This is where it gets interesting, because black mold and other mold and mycotoxins are far more prolific and have a much deeper effect on your psyche and physiology than what is believed. This is why during full moons people’s symptoms tend to be exacerbated, the air feels charged, lunacy comes from the lunar, because fungi grows most during full moons more so than other nights and again during rain storms and thunderstorms. This is why you might hear someone with a chronic injury saying they can feel the weather changing, part of this is pressure changes but a lot more of it is the increased inflammation and strain that the extra spores can put on the body.

I believe mold is the cause of many sleep anomalies, like hallucinations, auditory and visual. Seeing shadow people, maybe even sleepwalking or sleep talking. Insomnia is a common symptom of a full moon on top of feeling strange and or crazy. Seasonal mood disorders go hand in hand with weather changes and full moons.

Sometimes even just waking up you find yourself in pain, your nose is running or stuffed, you wake up sore and didn’t sleep well. There is a cause of this, it's the spores in the air invading your body as you sleep. When you are able to clean out the dust you tend to feel a lot better. Most commonly however people have a source of mold in their air ducts that they breathe in constantly. Now not always is there mold actively growing and sometimes the mycotoxins are neutralized, but to some extent breathing in particles can still force your body to have to fight them off.

It works very subtly, I talk about this to some extent in a previous video but I wanted to emphasize black mold, which was kind of the primary fungus I had in mind when I was making the video, even though I was speaking more broadly.

Here are some effects that I think are symptoms of black mold that are not talked about or studied.

Anxiety when you're away from home. Homesickness as it is called, I don’t mean just wanting to go home after you’ve been gone awhile, there is a safety and security and familiarity in your home, when I’m talking about is a sort of parasitic or symbiotic relationship with your home. When the only time you feel like yourself is when you are home, and oftentimes accompanying this feeling is a random fear of certain parts of your house, or when it's dark and you think you see shadow figures in the closet or the corners. You become both obsessed and afraid of your home. It’s really quite bizarre when you think about it but this happens without you even realizing it. It could be decades long.

The more we use our air conditioning, and the cheaper materials we use and the less knowledge of how to regularly care for your utilities is going to cause more mold growth, whether it's in a new home or an old home.

So unnatural attachment is one possible effect of mold, declining health or irritability is another. You might just feel bad all the time or like there’s a brain fog and you have trouble remembering anything, like basic stuff like how your day went, what you ate, what happened last week or last month or even the last couple years.

Complacency is another big one, the lack of motivation to do or clean anything. You’ll tell yourself you need to clean something out and then you never get to it. It’s like there’s a physical or mental barrier stopping you from getting rid of the mold. You’ll see a lot of strange and wild responses if you try to bring it up to someone you suspect might be exposed to mold, even if you're just suggesting it to check every possible reason why they might be feeling bad.

Firstly they will probably disbelieve everything you say, they will ignore you, they may even believe you but then feel like there’s nothing they can do. Keep in mind, it is in the mold’s best interest to keep you complacent.

One of the most striking examples I can think of is in hoarders. These people who are clearly in an unhealthy ecosystem are likely a breeding zone for molds and this forms that attachment to the objects and the house and prevents them from even going near their stuff. It’s like they can’t get rid of anything but they also refuse to go near it.

I’m arguing that this is a mold issue. These mycotoxins affect the brain, many mold can pass the blood-brain barrier. I also think that most of the actual symptoms are from higher exposures to it. We only understand it to cause certain symptoms because we don’t consider any sort of mental illness or behavior or anomaly to be linked to anything physical, certainly not microscopic.

I just wanted to go over that again for anyone who didn’t quite catch it in the other post, you know just trying to be more specific and give you better examples, but now that we’ve established some of what black molds can do, we can get in to the main part of the video

Parafungal activity. As the phrase may suggest, I am proposing that our very idea of paranormal activity is in fact, fungal activity, most often mold growth.

Consider a haunted house, or haunted graveyard or haunted asylum. Think of all the crazy stories and superstitions surrounding ghost hunting and ghost stories. What’s going on is mycotoxins in those locations. You enter a haunted asylum and immediately are hit with unease. You might hallucinate, or think you're hallucinating, you might feel scared, or depressed or even sick. And a lot of times people come back from these experiences and say they are “haunted” . They've been infected with some mold that’s either growing in them or weakened their immune response enough for something else to make them sick.

It also appears once you’ve been exposed to black mold enough to get sick from it, you will constantly find yourself exposed to it again and again. It seems like a permanent effect, even if you detox, you’ll always be at risk of exposure and then again there are plenty of people that have no ill effects around mold, which messes with the data and its why so few scientists and doctors think anything of mold, its inconsistent because we don’t understand all the factors that go into mold poisoning.

But you have to think these asylums or haunted houses are usually considered haunted because of some brutal living conditions, whether it was torture, or experimentation or murder, you’ve got to imagine some level of mold growth is going on. If there are dead bodies, there are things decomposing those dead bodies and the mold can live practically indefinitely in nooks and crannies of the house, slowly releasing spores.

This is the basis for paranormal belief. It’s ancient. We’ve personified mold into demons, ghouls, vampires, werewolves, poltergeists etc. Again this is why full moon and late in the night is believed to be so connected to evil. Fungi doesn’t grow in sunlight, just like a vampire.

The personification of mold isn’t exactly wrong or bad, there is an intelligence to mold, we’ve studied this and we don’t know how far this goes, it's completely unknown territory. But humans personifying mold is accurate in our perception that there is something actively taking advantage of you and your mind. It knows how to manipulate you. And the kind of mold grown from gross torture and brutal murders is likely to be far more toxic, there seems to be a relationship between human intention and actions and the sort of mold that grows, the potency and virulence of it.

Even ancient Egyptian tombs are cursed, this curse is unknowingly mold, that’s why sometimes people get sick and die during excavations. The curse is the mold, just because they didn’t know the microscopic properties of these spirits and magic, doesn’t mean they didn’t understand its existence. Ancient people equated anything antifungal or rust resistant to be holy.

Silver, gold, these are rust resistant and its believed that those properties can be extended to the person. Sometimes there are chemical reactions that can protect from mold, but also just being able to wear something that isn’t actively growing mold will appear to have the same effect as if it is actually blocking mold. This is the purpose of a talisman or holy object.

The idea of metaphysical gemstones comes from this as well. Mayans used certain zeolite minerals to purify their water for drinking. The new age sort of movement on crystals is based on the ability and belief of some crystals to actually be antifungal, whether through ionization of air or chemical and mineral effects as it can be absorbed in the bloodstream.

As I've talked about in previous videos, hanging garlic, or making circles of salt or burning sage and other popular incense from folklore drive away evil spirits because these are all antifungal agents.

And they are antifungal because many of these herbs and plants have to develop chemical defenses to fight fungi, and some of these chemicals can be used by humans for the same purposes.

So if you feel scared in your home, or think and object or location is haunted, its is likely infected with some type of mold, again there are millions of undocumented species of fungi in the world, we know of only 5%. And we don’t even have a full understanding of the little we do know.

But it is the source of paranormal activity, supernatural belief, spiritual experience and folk legends of spirits and creatures, concepts of holy vs demonic. Haunted graves and buildings and objects.

Our personification helped ancient man to understand this intelligent and invisible microscopic force, the trend of abstraction has merely altered our perception of the whole matter of supernatural, paranormal and divine entities through thousands of years of repeated personification, however time and time again we can search for the fungal references in religions, cultural practice and folk belief as well as our own modern interpretation of a force we hardly comprehend, that being fungi and molds. 

And some final thoughts, that you may even think are fringe, even if you can start to agree with everything else I just talked about. These are some thoughts I’ve been having on the matter.

I think fungi contain memory. A mold that gets into the brain or taps into the nervous system is able to essentially download information from the host, this is part of how they form symbiosis, it's the process of lichenization of mycorrhizal or parasitism, depending on the organisms. But they contain that memory and when you or a loved one dies, you may experience their presence, their ghost, maybe it's in a place they used to be a lot and you are breathing in spores that were connected to them at one point, or perhaps you share many of the spores they shared and so that memory is far more vivid because it is in the fungal consciousness or database.

I believe this explains reincarnation as well. Your past life is not your past life, but a fungal organism that was in some other person or creature and is now in you.

It's a lot to think about and take in, so I encourage you to think about this stuff, put your thoughts or experience in the comments, let’s talk about this stuff.

I think there is something to be said about computer anomalies as well. I think fungi can affect hardware as well. Computer hardware tends to only malfunction, you know unrelated to coding issues and stuff, when dust and debris fill up. But dust is a basket term and often that dust may compose of spores and I think fungi can tap into computers as well.

I have an experiment in mind I wish I had the resources to test that involves how to go about testing different fungi to see if they are capable of using computer hardware, or tapping into circuitry, which we know they more or less do with roots and what not and their growth spurts during lightning storms or their ability to hack nervous systems.

It’s interesting and there is a lot of ground to cover, like archetypes, and zodiac and physiognomic expression and psychology and divination and mycelium consciousness and yeah, well one topic at time, thanks for reading",conspiracy,Zodiac

No mention of why the Bad Guys are angry enough to resort to violence. Nope. They're just irrational bad guys. Monsters. And monsters aren't human. Monsters just need to be killed before they kill us with all their crazy gain of function experiments with Coronaviruses. 


#Multiple Researchers At Chinese Lab In Wuhan Were Hospitalized With COVID-19-Like Symptoms In November 2019: U.S. Intelligence Report

This is how the long game is playing out. Slowly over the next couple of years the narrative will build. The rhetoric will escalate. The plebiscite will demand retribution, while fully convinced by their cognitive dissonance that they're only trying to free China to spread Democracy. After all, they can't be allowed to continue doing their mad science experiments, can they? They could end up wiping out the human race, couldn't they? So they have to be stopped. After all, what kind of monsters would do those sort of experiments and risk causing a world wide pandemic?    



#How to fix U.S. biosecurity leaks? Close some labs

>In the wake of disclosures that top government labs mishandled anthrax, smallpox and avian flu, U.S. health authorities are considering the once unthinkable: cutting the burgeoning number of labs working with the planet's most dangerous microbes.     
When the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week unveiled a report documenting multiple safety breaches at its labs, its director for the first time suggested the country turn back the rapid-fire proliferation of such research units, which have tripled in little more than a decade to at least 1,500. 
[Source Here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-anthrax-labs-analysis-idUSKBN0FJ0BC20140714)      


Oh. Crap. Well at least we want to slow down the research here. That's a good start. I mean, we aren't the bad guys, are we? Nope. We're the good guys. They're the **BAD GUYS**.   

#Why Would the US Have Funded the Controversial Wuhan Lab?

>According to Newsweek, funding for the WIV occurred in two phases. The first took place from 2014 to 2019, through a $3.7 million project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses. This work was largely led by Dr. Zhengli Shi, known to many as “batwoman” for her years investigating caves in search of new bat viruses. The second phase began shortly after, with another $3.7 million. Unlike the first, this project appears to have included work on “gain-of-function”: research that investigates how a virus can gain the ability to infect a new type of animal.

Oh. Now I'm not a genius, but, doesn't this look like a set up. Work with Chinese scientists. Give China money. Fund the Research. Deny that it could have come from a lab. And then as time goes on, start to acknowledge the possibility that it came from a lab.     


But what about all those videos from Wuhan that were scrubbed from the internet?   

Remember those videos? Here you go. [Videos of Wuhan Outbreak](https://archive.org/download/2019-nCoV/nothingburger/)        


Still there. For now. But why did they disappear so quickly? Why didn't our news media pick it up? Sure we had a few reports, but nothing crazy. So why? And why didn't our elected officials do anything about it? Don't we have a massive world wide surveillance network to keep us prepared?   


#Investigation into shutdown of Canada’s respected pandemic early warning agency

>But during the first term of the Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government and one year before the current pandemic began sweeping the world, the GPHIN was quietly shut down and researchers moved to other functions. Scientists at Public Health and GPHIN had expressed concern that their warnings and other scientific information was not being listened to or properly understood by government officials in the health department and that they were being marginalized.
The Globe and Mail reported in July that Canada’s Auditor-General was planning to investigate why the agency was shut down after rs of issuing some 1,500 timely alerts into outbreaks like  SARS in China in 1998, MERS,  H1N1 in Mexico, bird flu in 2005 that Iran tried to hide, Zika in West Africa and ebola.

Ok. Ok. Back the crap up buttercup. So Trudeau knows that a Chinese national was kicked out of our highest security biological lab, and he didn't try to get another pandemic response team up and running? Come on. You have to admit that's odd. Oh well, at least he closed all the airports in an effort to contain the risk? Oh that's right, our airports never shut down. Why it almost feels like they wanted the pandemic to get bad, doesn't it? And if that was the case, maybe all of those Wuhan drop dead on the streets videos were deep fakes. Or just staged. Because really, who knows.     


But let me ask you this, if China intentionally released a virus, then why would they open up immediately? Wouldn't it look better to stay closed? Wouldn't the bluff be more believable? And if they did unleash a bioweapon, then why would they have been trying to steal our vaccine research? Wouldn't they already have a vaccine ready?

**To achieve a better outcome, the world must act jointly and swiftly to revamp all aspects of our societies and economies, from education to social contracts and working conditions.

#US military considered using nuclear weapons against China in 1958 Taiwan Strait crisis, leaked documents show

[Source Here](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/24/china/us-china-taiwan-1958-nuclear-intl-hnk/index.html)    


So Daniel just conveniently sat on this information for fifty years, and just decided now to release it? BS. That's a warning hidden in plain sight. One hundred percent. Our side wants a war. They have wanted to bring China to heel, and China isn't playing ball. Pivot to Asia? War games being played worldwide in preparation. And now guess what? Most of us are ready to lash out at someone after this pandemic. And now they are getting ready to aim the gun. Why do you think they're moving so fast on Skyborg and the Loyal Wingman project? Why do you think they're upgrading our ballistic missle defense for North America? And hey, it's a good thing that we have a lot more unemployed now, more people to fight for our freedom!    

But you may think this is taking things too far. Ok. First of all, go back and read the first post in this series. These aren't new issues, and even back then I saw where this was heading, I just thought it was going to happen a lot sooner.

But I jumped the gun. And guess what? We probably still have some time to go. Why would I think that? 


#2022   

Two reasons. Number one comes from a chief scientist from the Rockefeller Foundation. Here's a quote from Flatten the Curve. [Part 4.](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracytheories/comments/gr1u9o/flatten_the_curve_pt_4_the_rockefeller_connection/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)



>One of those papers was written by Jesse Huntley Ausubel. He is an American environmental scientist and program manager of a variety of global biodiversity and ecology research programs. Ausubel serves as Director and Senior Research Associate of the Program for the Human Environment of **Rockefeller University.**     
If you read his paper you'll find a prediction, a prediction which establishes 2022 as the start of the next great power struggle for the American Empire, and suggests the winner of this war shall likely become the world's first superpower. 
[2015 PDF Quantitative Dynamics of Human Empires](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236971590_Quantitative_Dynamics_of_Human_Empires&ved=2ahUKEwiJ187Rg9LpAhXkAp0JHb2oCsgQFjACegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1hk_b116lXzgjcaNtwt6Oz&cshid=1590513746159)


Hmmm. So they predicted a great power struggle, and then coincidences happen and now fingers are starting to blame the only country that could challenge the west for the pandemic. Perfectly **New Normal**.    


And what's the other reason why I think 2022 will be the starting point? Do you remember I Pet Goat 2? Hopefully you do. If not, here you go.   


[I Pet Goat Two](https://youtu.be/65xLByzT1l0)    


Now full disclosure. I was going to make an entire post about this viral video (that popped up out of nowhere just like the plague doctor video), but decided against it. It just wouldn't work in a written post. Too many images involved. But. This video has a lot of strange info that people have missed when analyzing it. And I'll be making assorted references to this video in other posts. For now, let me show you how the 2022 time frame is predicted in this video.   

Sun Sue is a character in the video representing China. And it also happens that Sun Tzu was mentioned in the Dark Winter Exercise (another veiled threat) about anthrax, which happened three months before 9-11 and the anthrax being sent shortly thereafter.    

But I'm getting off track.    

Now if you watch the video you'll notice Sun Sue being approached by a Skull and Bones figure (do I need to elaborate here? Probably not) and when he taps her on the shoulder as she's trying to stop the tanks, you'll notice something on her leather jacket. What is it? A tiger.    

[Tiger Image Jacket](https://images.app.goo.gl/2zVkPTXJvhv7ZS4z8)     


So why's this a big deal?    


**Chinese Zodiac**.    


Years of the Tiger: 1926, 1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2010, 2022. **In 2022, it will be the year of the Chinese Zodiac Tiger**, it starts from the Chinese lunar New Year.    


Yeah. **Not Cool**. And when did this video come out? 2013.     


#Let that sink in.    


It came out in 2013. Do you want predictive programming? There's your predictive programming. And I honestly hope it isn't. Because this isn't going to be a war. It will be an apocalypse.     


#Final Thoughts 

So how did the video creator know to show us a Skull and Bones character metaphorically wanting a war against China, and suggesting that it will start in 2022?       


Who the heck knows. Seriously. Cause this crap is starting to freak me out. Ok. Not really. But I have a pretty open mind to...what? The paranormal? Precognitive capabilities? An omen? Man, I just don't know. But I'm not going to deny what I'm seeing. Not even for one second. And when I add up that video, the Rockefeller scientists and his Qualitative Dynamics of Human Empires, and the inconsistencies in our own Governments behavior leading up to the pandemic, it doesn't look good.      

Not at all.     


So don't dismiss anything. Don't assume that life in a few years will be like life was before. Take a little time and just think, what if. What would I do. What do I need. Because you may not have the luxury of time **if** something happens.     


Keep your head up and eyes open.     

Talk soon.

The Cold War’s nuclear proliferation treaties are now fading into history: the US and Russia broke with a treaty two years ago that had been signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. Now Boris Johnson has reversed Britain’s long-established policy of reducing the nuclear stockpile. As part of the integrated review, the Prime Minister increased the amount of Trident nuclear warheads from 180 to 260. It came in part as a response to Britain’s rivals ‘increasing and diversifying their arsenals’.    
[Source Here](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/a-nuclear-crisis-is-closer-than-you-think) 

Given that Boris Johnson’s new strategy also implies the possibility of responding with a nuclear strike to a non-nuclear threat, the chances of issuing a wrong order could lead to a modern-day Dr Strangelove scenario. In Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 film, Strangelove’s ‘doomsday machine’ consisted of nuclear bombs that would detonate automatically at the time of an enemy strike. If they went off, the world would be destroyed.        
Britain is joining the new nuclear arms race, led by the US, Russia, and China. Last month, in fact, it was announced that Russia is to press ahead with plans to test Poseidon missiles in the Arctic, which could trigger radioactive tsunamis off America’s eastern coast. This worrying development came after three Russian nuclear-powered submarines simultaneously broke through Arctic ice in an exercise designed to show its military might.


NATO has repeatedly rejected calls for adopting NFU policy,[3] arguing that pre-emptive nuclear strike is a key option, in order to have a credible deterrent that could compensate for the overwhelming conventional weapon superiority enjoyed by the Soviet Army in the Eurasian land mass.[4][5] In 1993, Russia dropped a pledge against first use of nuclear weapons made in 1982 by Leonid Brezhnev.[6] In 2000, a Russian military doctrine stated that Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons ""in response to a large-scale conventional aggression"".     China declared its NFU policy in 1964, and has since maintained this policy.    
India declared its NFU policy in 1998, and has since maintained this policy.

Stay safe. Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.",conspiracy,Zodiac
10,9/11 was an occult Mega-Ritual. The numbers of the 4 flights were chosen specifically for their occult significance. Can we use this occult script to predict the next false flag? (Hint: don't go to Phoenix this Xmas!),101.0,14utv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/,152.0,1355512330.0,"I've been researching the anomalies surrounding the events of 9/11 for 10 years now...and never before have I come across such damning information regarding the occult nature of the Mega-Ritual that was carried out on that fateful day.

9/11 was *so* effective that it literally incapacitated the majority of the world's population. The event was so diabolical, so *grand*, that it literally brought about an alchemical transmutation in the minds of the populace. 

The events that day polarized the world more than any before: some people were thrust further into the blindness of their ""matrix"", and others were catapulted directly out of it, being forced into Chapel Perilous.

I've come a long way in my research surrounding this event (as have many of you), but I wasn't prepared for the revelations in this book: [""The Most Dangerous Book in the World: 9/11 as Mass Ritual""](http://www.amazon.com/The-Most-Dangerous-Book-World/dp/1937584178/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1355502572&sr=8-1&keywords=the+most+dangerous+book+in+the+world).

So, why are the flight numbers on 9/11 so important? 

11...175...77...93...

...and what do they have to do with ""the wickedest man in the world"", [Aleister Crowley?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley)

If I ever had a doubt about the ritualistic nature of 9/11 (and the sheer degree of planning that went into it), I couldn't be more convinced now.

The Twin Towers, the Twin Pillars of Hercules, the Gemini of astrology, Joachim and Boaz of Freemasonry (with the ""Salomon's"" Temple Building 7 accompanying them)...were they constructed with the foreknowledge that they would be brought down in a fiery sacrificial cataclysm?

So what does this have to do with the infamous Aleister Crowley? And what does the number 11 have do with all of this?

In Crowley's own words: the number 11 is ""the number of Magick in itself [and] therefore suitable to all types of operation. [It is] the sacred number par excellence of the new Aeon [the Aeon of Horus, Crowley's name for the new age, with himself as the prophet, of course.]""

What better way to start a Mega-Ritual on the 11th day of September (111 days before the end of the year) than to have Flight 11 crash into the tower on the 93rd floor (the significance of that number will become apparent, if it isn't already).

And the second plane? Flight 175 would soon smash into the *77th* floor of the other tower. We'll get to the 77, but for now what's the significance of 175?

Since we're in the realm of Crowley, let's see what he had to say about 175.

""There are three main methods of invoking any Deity...The 'First Method' consists of devotion to that Deity...a perfect instruction exists in Liber 175. This is the book of uniting to a particular Deity by devotion.""

[Here's the Wikipedia page for the Libri of Crowley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libri_of_Aleister_Crowley). Note that 175 says ""On uniting oneself to a Deity.""

Before you start to think this is getting way too esoteric, I'll give you three guesses as to which Deity was being invoked (and the first two don't count).

Again in Crowley's own words: ""I was not content to believe in a personal devil and serve him, in the ordinary sense of the word. I wanted to get hold of him personally and become his chief of staff.""

So, is there an unusual event that might give us an idea which Deity was invoked when 175 supposedly hit the tower?

If you recall what the Commander in Thief at the time was doing, well then it should become painfully obvious.

The moment the 2nd plane hit the tower George W. Bush was reading [""The Pet Goat""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Pet_Goat) in Sarasota, Florida, strangely enough just 10 miles away from Venice, the location of the flight school Mohamed Atta and another ""hijacker"" trained at. What a coincidence!

This ""reading"" of The Pet Goat was essentially a ""Black Mass"", a ""satirical ceremony, a Commander-in-Chief that wouldn't leave his seat until the reading of a story about a pet goat was completed (""I read this book that I may study the nature of my Deity,"") during which time hundreds of his fellow Americans were in harm's way, many of them meeting horrific ends as they burned alive or plunged to their deaths from the towers (""Yet also may he deliberately practise cruelties"")--conjuring the image of [The Tower tarot card](http://www.rootwerx.com/tarotdecks/bosch/the-tower/images/Rider-Waite_The_Tower_large.jpg)--all taking place in...""Paradise,"" the city of Sarasota's unofficial yet widely-used nickname. Well How about that?""

For those who still are unsure what Deity was being invoked, [here's an image that may give you a hint](http://kkoagulaa.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/baphomet.jpg).

If you *still* think all of this is a stretch, hang on, it gets better (or worse, depending on how you look at it)!

AA77 was supposedly piloted by an individual who, according to one of his instructors, ""could not fly at all."" And yet he was able to pull off an *incredible* stunt, and instead of attacking several more strategic points in the Pentagon, he just so happened to choose the very wing were the DoD's accounting division was located...and conveniently enough Donald Rumsfeld had announced the *day before* the attacks they they couldn't account for $2.3 *trillion* in transactions. The records of this and interest in this announcement all but disappeared after the attacks.

Is there significance to the number 77? You bet your occult-deciphering ass there is. 

[A∴A∴](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4) is a magical order that was created by Crowley in 1907. [Here's their seal](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/A.%27.a.%27._seal.png).

AA77 anyone???????

From The Book of Lies: ""7, the septenary; 11, the magical number; 77, the manifestation, therefore, of the septenary. Through matter, because 77 is written in Hebrew Ayin Zayin (OZ), and He-Goat, the symbol of matter, Capricornus, the Devil of the Tarot; which is the picture of the Goat of the Sabbath upon an altar.

Black Mass anyone?

Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, lists 77 ""infernal names"" of the ""Gods and Goddesses of the Royal Palace of Hell.""

It gets better: the Pentagon, which is 77 feet tall, is located on the [*77th meridian west!*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77th_meridian_west). Oh and George H.W. Bush, who first announced his plans for a ""New World Order"" on September 11th, 1990 (11 years before...well shit this is just getting too obvious), well daddy Bush was...77 at the time of the attacks.

For the record, I'm not demonizing *any* of these numbers. Symbols can be used for good *or* evil, I don't believe a number can be inherently ""evil."" After all, ""Symbols don't kill people; people with symbols kill people.""

Any more 77's we can add to this already overbearing occult script? You bet.

I'm sure most of you are familiar with the ""mystery plane"" that was spotting in New York and above the Pentagon during the attacks. The plane has [since been identified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4#September_11.2C_2001) as the E-4B, a highly secretive and advanced plane also referred to as the ""Doomsday Plane"".

A FOIA request *finally* got more information from the FAA in 2008 about this extremely unusual plane that should *not* have been there (unless it piloting the attack aircraft by remote control, but that opens a whole new can of worms. The call sign of this plane that was spotted above the Pentagon during the attack? VENUS77!

For those that are astrologically-minded, the conjunctions of the planet Venus against the Zodiac [form a pentagram!](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m4vuo4c01W4/ULUX7nPQdBI/AAAAAAAAA74/7kuCnP21xYk/s1600/Example_Venus_pentagram.jpg)...Venus invokes the pentagram (plenty of information available on this with a simple online search).

So Flight 77 eliminates Rummy's dirty laundry (along with anyone else who knew too much) by hitting the 77-foot tall Pentagon (with 7 floors!), on the 77th meridian west, while the Doomsday Plane, call sign Venus77 (Pentagram 77!) circles above. Oh, and flight 175, the plane that evoked the ""Deity"", hit the 77th floor.

And what about that final number? Flight 11 hit floor 93...the final fateful flight that day was...drumroll...flight 93!

For those who are familiar with Crowley, this 4th flight is by far the *easiest* to associate with the diabolical individual.

In fact, there's an entire [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/93_%28Thelema%29) on the importance of the number 93 to Crowley and his religious philosophy Thelema. In fact, Thelemites ofter greet each other with ""93"" or will sign correspondences with ""93/93"" at the end. Flight 93...flight AA11 crashes into the 93rd floor...is this starting to make more or less sense?

There is a great deal of information out their on Building 7 as well, including it essentially being an occult-Masonic construct (Salomon building anyone?). It's 47 stories and trapezoidal shape can attest to that (the 47th Problem of Euclid, also known as the Pythagorean Theorem, ""represents a perfect symbol of Freemasonry"").

There is of course a *whole* new can of worms to open with respect to the *astrological* importance of the 9/11 Mega-Ritual, but there is far too much information on this topic to delve into here, as this is already becoming long-winded.

However, more information can be found in this [well-made series of Youtube videos.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkwBjLG1ULA&feature=player_embedded#!) In a nutshell, Saturn and Pluto achieved a position of powerful opposition on September 11th, 2001 (they are both considered to be ""Lords of Death). Any astrologer can tell you that this alignment does *not* bode well for the people on Earth.

Whether or not you believe in astrology is irrelevant...what *is* relevant is that TPTB *do* believe in this stuff and they flaunt it in our faces because they *can*.

For those of you who *have* been studying these occult scripts, it should come as no surprise that Sirius would get dragged into this mess as well. 

From ""The Most Dangerous Book"": ""Today's Coptic calendar (also called the Alexandrian calendar) is based on the ancient Egyptian calendar and is still used in Egypt, and also by the Coptic Orthodox Church. The first month of the year is named Thout, after Thoth, and thus the first day of the New Year is the 1st of Thout. On the Gregorian calendar, this date coincides with September 11th--so that date is not only New Year's Day, but, more importantly, it is the symbolic, or observed, date of Sirius' heliacal rising.""

Of course, the precession of the equinoxes has shifted this a bit, and today that date has shifted 45 days...now the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs on August 5th.

You'll never guess which date *both* the Statue of Liberty (really an homage to both Isis and Lucifer) and the Twin Towers were ""initiated""...August 5th! (Oh, and the Pentagon was initiated in a Masonic ceremony on September *11th* 1941.)

The occult importance of Sirius is beyond the scope of this post, but just trust me that it's important! Did TPTB do anything to associated the event with the word ""Sirius?"" You betcha.

Do a search for 9/11 and Sirius and you'll find that the only K-9 (K=11...11-9...9-11...maybe I need to slow down a bit) who died on that fateful day was named.......SIRIUS. Sirius was dog number 17...17 is The Star in the Tarot...which according to occultists depicts the star of SIRIUS. cough.

If you think it's overkill that they would name and sacrifice a dog merely to add another layer to their occult script, well then you still don't really get how these events work. The *more* symbolism they cram into the rituals, the more powerful the ritual becomes.

Walter Cruttenden, June 2016


""Astrophysicists around the world, including Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin at Caltech, believe there is a large force tugging on our solar system. It has led them to speculate that a massive 9th Planet exists somewhere beyond the known planets.

 
The Binary Research Institute acknowledges there is large force tugging on the southwest underbelly of our solar system. We have been pointing this out for the better part of ten years in various papers and articles. These arguments on the BRI website show the precession observable, the Sun’s apparent lack of angular momentum relative to the planets, the unusual motion and position of unbound space probes, the elongated orbits of the minor planets, etc. are best explained if there is a very large object pulling on our solar system. But we do not think it is a 9th Planet. The force appears to be too great.""

""Considering  the direction and incline of the minor planet orbits it would appear that **our solar system is  being  affected by the Sirius binary system.** This system is equivalent to at least three solar masses. It is  also the nearest star system where one of the companions is a white dwarf. Such stars are much denser than normal matter, meaning  a tea spoonful of this dense matter would weigh about two tons. While there  are other stars and star systems that are closer, none are as collectively heavy, and none contain a  white  dwarf. Consequently, the Sirius system makes the biggest dent in the local space/time fabric.""

**Did the ancient civilizations know about the Sirius secret?**

[Edward G. Nightingale](https://grahamhancock.com/nightingalee3/) proposes that ""Giza was created as a repository for advanced scientific knowledge. The Sphinx views the eastern horizon, its counterpart in the sky is Leo, the lion shaped asterism created in the stars indexed with the star Regulus. The job of the Sphinx is to record the range of the ecliptic from winter solstice though the spring equinox, summer solstice, fall equinox returning yearly to the winter solstice.

It is this view of Sirius on the horizon, the position of the Pleiades, and the relative position of the Great Orion Nebula that is being tracked and documented. The movements of the star Sirius and the Pleiades star cluster are at odds with the current theory of precession in that they do not demonstrate the so-called wobble motion of the Earth’s axis. This implies that Sirius and the Pleiades are on a similar trajectory as our solar system. In fact, that is exactly what I have discovered encoded in The Giza Template. I **propose that our solar system, the star Sirius and the Pleiades star cluster system were birthed from the same stellar nebula,** that being the Great Orion Nebula, M42. These three systems are each on their own spiral trajectory or path, each being separated by time and distance directly related to the Great Year Cycle of 25,920 years. These star systems are moving away from the M42 Nebula in a spiral motion with our ecliptic rolling along like a wheel on a spiral path.""

EDIT:

Another summary of Walter Cruttenden's thoughts:

https://www.sott.net/article/230480-Is-the-Sun-Part-of-a-Binary-Star-System-Six-Reasons-to-Consider

""Just what is the real cause behind the precession of the equinoxes and why did the ancients believe this cycle was so important? Walter Cruttenden asks this question in his latest book Lost Star of Myth and Time and comes to some provocative conclusions. 

To the layman, the precession of the equinoxes is the observed motion of the night sky shifting backwards by a small amount every year. Of course, the night sky continuously shifts throughout the year as the Earth orbits around the Sun, but if one were to take a fixed point in time (like the Vernal Equinox, for instance) and take a snapshot of the sky on that day every year, one would notice the sky slowly shifting backwards with each progressing year. This is what is meant by the precession of the zodiac, or precessional movement. Astrologers would say we are in a different 'age' or zodiac sign depending on which constellations are visible in the sky on the Vernal Equinox of a particular year. This precessional movement of the sky amounts to about 50 arc seconds per year and takes about 24,000-26,000 years to complete a full cycle; the ""great year"" or ""great world cycle"" as it is often called.

Sir Isaac Newton was the first to put forth the idea that this precession is due to a wobbly motion of the Earth's axis, and few scientists have challenged this assumption since Newton's time. Cruttenden dares to ask the most basic question about this in his book bringing together a number of clues to form a hypothesis for precession being the result of the Sun moving in a binary orbit about a companion star. **Could Cruttenden's speculations really lead to data that could overturn the ideas of Newton - a man treated like a deity in the world of physics and astronomy?** As we'll see below, there's actually a large body of evidence to support Cruttenden's ideas.""

Prepare for INTENSITY",75.0,j4lew1,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/j4lew1/jupiter_conjunct_saturn_what_we_will_approach/,46.0,1601754242.0,"Hi guys, i am into astrology and i been researching a bit, just a bit (cause there is so much) about the relationship of this conjunction between this two planets in Aquarius and things that happen in the world under this influence.

What is a conjunction in astrology? Is when two planets meet each other on the same degree (same position) on the wheel of the zodiac (which has 360 degrees). The more exact the conjunction, the greater the force of the effect of this encounter, we use something called ""orbs"" to decide how much flexibility we will have to consider the spectrum of a conjunction (or any other aspect), because both planets could be at exactly the same degree or they could be 1,2,3,4 degrees a part. But as i said before, if they are 3 degrees a part this will still have influence but not as much as if they share exactly the same degree. Basically the closer the stronger the influence.

The information i will provide here is for solid exact or almost exact conjunctions, less than 1 degree a part, and always of Jupiter and Saturn in Aquarius.

Other thing to consider is that in Astrology geometry is important, there are many aspects the planets can do which each other, i will just describe some of them, but not all:

Conjunction (0 degrees), Sextile (60), Square (90), Trine (120), Opossition (180)

This will become more important later when we dig deeper looking for a closer similarities beteween different moments of history.

This is a superficial observation and i invite any of you to add more information of this topic if your are interested, but i wanted to share some info that i found already.

26 days days ago this was posted on this sub:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/inwg6d/astrotheology\_2020\_the\_great\_conjunction/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/inwg6d/astrotheology_2020_the_great_conjunction/)

I loved that post and made me extremely curious so i started looking for moments in the past with some of the same influences. I recommend everyone giving a look to that post before continuing in this one.

This conjunction of Jupiter with Saturn in Aquarius will start on 20 December 2020 (to take into account for later, there are other aspects between other planets that will become important later) and will last til Dec 30.

So the first question is, when has the world been under this aspect in the past? (500BC - 2050 spectrum)

1405, 1345, 1286, 1226, 670, 610, 551, 491, 432,184 BC, 244 BC, 303/304 BC, 363 BC

Any interesting dates for you?

Now, on 20 December 2020, Jupiter conjunct Saturn on Aquarius is not the only aspect, what about if we sum anther aspect to search in the past for dates and narrow the numbers? So we will add a Square between Lilith in Taurus with Jupiter/Saturn in Aquarius which happens on this date also.

Any other date in the past which share the mains aspect we are talking about and this one?

610

Interesting, Muhammad started preaching secretly that year what we call Islam.

Also, 1345 rings any bells? Black death started 1346.

We will encounter a new pandemic? We will see the surge of a new world religion?

This post is rusty, i know, i still have to research more about the other dates i shared with you and what happened, if someone is interested, check out if something interesting/significant happened in those years, comment it here and i will add it to the post (which is not finished).",conspiracy,Zodiac

The occult symbolism of 9/11 can be explained via Freemasonry:

1. Anno Lucis is a Freemasonic calendar that begins in the year 4000 BC to correspond with the start of the Age of Taurus.

2. The zero year point at which Jesus was born was the beginning of the Age of Pisces. This is why he was/is associated with the fish.

3. This means that two ages, Taurus and Aries, lasted 4000 years, or 2000 years apiece.

4. 2000 years after Jesus' birth was the year 2000, obviously. Therefore, 2001 was the first year of the Age of Aquarius, according to this calendar.

5. The [Masonic Royal Arch picture](http://i.imgur.com/5894BlT.jpg?1) shows the Lion, Ox, Eagle, and Man. They represent the zodiac signs of Leo, Taurus, Scorpio, and Aquarius.  

6. The Royal Arch also shows two pillars (towers) connected by an arch. This is a symbol of the alchemical marriage. The pillars symbolize the masculine/feminine, yin/yang dualities within man which must be united to attain higher consciousness. The arch and keystone unite the opposites.

7. Why is it about higher consciousness? Because, according to occultists, consciousness increases as the ages advance towards a Golden Age. This is why they have the cardinal zodiac ages in the middle of the archway. They symbolize the four seasons of cyclical history. Atlantis would be the last Golden Age in this scenario.

8. The two pillar duality is a symbol that takes multiple forms in Masonry, including the double-headed eagle, the checkerboard floor, the square and compass, the hexagram, etc. The hexagram is made of up-and-down triangles.

9. The Twin Towers were replaced by [one tower with sides shaped like up-and-down triangles](http://i.imgur.com/R7VIKUil.jpg). This is a hexagram symbol.


10. The Twin Towers were destroyed and replaced by a building which symbolizes their unification, or the occult unification of oppositions/dualities. This is symbolic of rising consciousness, and this rise happens with the advancing ages. 9/11 occurred at this point in history because it was the dawn of the Age of Aquarius.

The gospel of St Matthew opens the New Testament with a frightening visit from a skyborne being who descends from the starry heavens to proclaim a sensational message to terrified shepherds attending their flocks:

>Behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, *God* is with us.

This event - if it happened at all - would have occurred between four and eight years before the era which came to bear *'Christ'*'s name *Anno Domini* \- which is Latin for 'in the year of our Lord.'  


Like his death and alleged resurrection, the birth of *Jesus* of Nazareth is cloaked in mystery. Just as the pillar of light led the Israelites through the wilderness to the Promised Land in the Old Testament, another enigmatic object served to guide those with wisdom to the birthplace of a carpenter's son in the New Testament.

The ufological angle certainly seems to fit the account of this guiding light in the sky which is depicted on millions of Christmas cards all over the world. It is sung about in carols, it shines down from the tops of Christmas trees, and foil imitations of it twinkle over Nativity scenes.

>But just what was the Star of Bethlehem?  
Is it just a myth or did the starry messenger really exist in the skies of Judaea?

For centuries, theologians and scientists have argued over their interpretations of the celestial event, which was recorded only by the apostle Matthew.

In the second chapter of his gospel, Matthew tells us:

>""When *Jesus* was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the King, behold, there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem, saying, 'where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East and have come to worship him.' ""

According to Matthew, Herod summons the mysterious Wise Men and tells them that if they should find the newborn king, they must divulge the child's whereabouts to him.

Later, the Wise Men see the guiding star in the East and it leads him to the stable where the babe *Jesus* is sleeping.  


In the 17th century, the great German astronomer **Kepler**, sent shockwaves through the Christian world when he suggested that *the star the Wise Men had followed might have been nothing more than a conjunction of the planets Saturn and Jupiter*. However, it is now known that no such conjunctions were visible in the Holy Land during the period St Matthew mentions, which historical scholars reckon is around 4 or 5 BC.

After Kepler's heretical attempts to explain away the Star of Bethlehem as a natural phenomenon, many other scientists also tried to formulate theories to rationalize the stellar oddity.

Halley's Comet was blamed but astronomers have calculated that the comet had already visited and left the heavens before *'Christ'*'s birth.

Another theory proposed that the star that hovered over the stable was actually a distant star that had exploded - or gone supernova, to use astronomers' jargon. Such explosions do occur from time to time and can remain visible in the sky for weeks, even during the daytime.  


Now, it is recorded in ancient Chinese texts that such a supernova explosion did occur - around 4 BC. Chinese astronomers of the time recorded that a star flared up in the constellation of Aquila the Eagle, just below the bright star Altair. What's more, it has been computed that, to anyone standing at the South Gate of Jerusalem, the brilliant star would appear to be over Bethlehem.  


The American scientist **A.J. Morehouse**, who discovered the Chinese record, therefore believes that the Star of Bethlehem is still in the sky, but it is very faint.  


Opponents of Morehouse's theory have pointed out that the exploding star of 4 BC occurred too late to be associated with the birth of *'Christ'*. Also, such a bright spectacle in the night sky would hardly have gone unnoticed by Herod and the other inhabitants of Judaea.

Moreover, a supernova cannot hover in the sky as the star of Bethlehem did over the manger.  


Just as enigmatic as the Star are the Wise men who followed it. Matthew simply states that they were from the East without specifying what countries they came from, and, contrary to popular belief, St Matthew does not actually say there were three of them. In fact, according to the early versions of the Nativity in Medieval times, there were twelve Wise Men!

Whatever their number, most Biblical scholars agree that the Wise Men were students of astrology, which was very popular among the Jewish community at the time.

This theory was strengthened by the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947. Among the timeworn Hebrew and Aramaic texts - some of which date back to the birth of *'Christ'* there are astrological charts depicting signs of the Zodiac and mystical texts referring to the influence of the stars and the planets on the newly-born. The Scrolls also mention an unnamed individual who lived at the time of the *Jesus* who was known as the Teacher of Righteousness.  


In the end, despite all the conjecture and historical research, we are still no nearer to uncovering the truth about the most mysterious herald in history - the Star of Bethlehem.

If it wasn't a comet, nor a planetary conjunction, then surely there is only one logical hypothesis which can explain a light in the sky which behaves as if it is controlled by an intelligence:

>the Star of Bethlehem was a spacecraft; and if we can accept this explanation, we must ask: what was it doing hovering over the stable where *Jesus* was born?

The Christians have longed claimed that the arrival of *'Christ'* at Bethlehem had been predicted centuries before.

In the Book of Micah 5:2 (written in the 8th Century BC), it states that the Messiah - Hebrew for ""the anointed one"" - would be born in Bethlehem, and in the Book of Isaiah 7:14 (also written in the 8th century BC) scripture specifically asserts that the person who will come as *God*'s representative in the flesh would be born of a virgin. In the Book of Malachi 3:1 it is foretold that someone would go ahead of the Messiah to prepare the way.

Most Christians have interpreted this as being John the Baptist.

In Isaiah 9:1-2 it predicts that the Messiah would live and work around Galilee in a northern province remote from the centers of power, and that he would heal people. The Book of Zechariah foretells that the long-awaited Messiah who would restore his people to a position of power and prosperity which they enjoyed under David and Solomon would ride into Jerusalem humbly, on a donkey, and not on the war-horse of a military conqueror.

In that same book a passage eerily maintains that the Messiah will be betrayed to his enemies for thirty pieces of silver. This prophecy seems to have been fulfilled by one Judas Iscariot.  


There are more amazingly accurate predictions in Psalms, the 19th book of the Old Testament. Crucifixion - execution by nailing the condemned to a cross - was unknown to the Hebrews until the Romans came to power, yet in Psalm 22 there is a graphic description of the way the Messiah will be put to death, hundreds of years before *Jesus* of Nazareth was crucified.

The passages say his hands and feet will be pierced, and that his executioners would mock him and gamble for his clothes. All of the incidents foretold by the Jewish scriptures, if applied to the life of *Jesus*, are astoundingly more accurate than the prophecies of Nostradamus.  


Little is known about the early days of *Jesus*, especially the circumstances of his conception and birth. Traditionally, March 25 is held as the Day of the Annunciation, when the angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would give birth to the Messiah.

Curiously, in May 1999, Israeli historians researching ancient copies of the Apocrypha told the newspaper National Midnight Star that one translation of the Virgin Mary's conception after a visitation from *God* described a chilling tale which sounded very similar to the accounts of people who had undergone gynecological examinations in UFO [abduction experiences](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_abductionabductees.htm).

When reporters pressed the codex researchers to comment further on their intriguing claims, but the historians were evidently advised by the religious authorities to withhold further interpretations of the timeworn texts.  


Even the hardened scientific skeptic, philosopher and historian **H.G. Wells** \- who was not at all impressed by Christianity - once wrote of *Jesus*:

>*'Christ'* is the most unique person in history. No one can write a history of the human race without giving first and foremost place to the penniless teacher from Nazareth.

In this age of scientific and medical marvels, it is possible through the techniques of artificial insemination to produce a child in the womb of a woman who is a virgin.

In Japan and America, scientists are making rapid progress with the development of artificial wombs which will allow the development of a fertilized egg into an embryo and finally a nine-month-old baby. These 'baby hatcheries' were described in 1932 within the pages of **Aldous Huxley**'s far-sighted novel [Brave New World](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/bravenewworld1.pdf), although Huxley confidently assured his shocked readers that *cloning and mechanical wombs were three centuries away.*

In 1962, the year before Huxley died, the English physicist **Francis Crick** and American biochemist **James Watson**, shared the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering the double-helix structure of DNA - the [genetic code](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_genoma.htm) of the human body.

Five years later, the British biologist **John B. Gurdon** *cloned a South African clawed frog.*

Eleven years after that, British Doctor **Patrick Steptoe** and his colleagues overcame the problem of sterility in women by producing the first test-tube baby outside the womb in July, 1978. Twenty years after that, scientists had cloned sheep and higher mammals, and it was recently claimed that cloned humans in America and Korea had been allowed to develop to an embryonic stage before being destroyed.  


Envisage then, a superior race from another world steering the affairs of mankind.

This higher race implants the embryo of *Jesus* into a peasant woman's womb so she becomes a surrogate mother. *Jesus* is born in an obscure village, and as he grows he probably becomes aware of the psychic superhuman talents he possesses. He works in a carpenter's shop in Nazareth until he his thirty, then embarks on a three-year mission which will sow the seeds for the most momentous sociological and philosophical revolution in world history.

Immediately the authorities realize that he is not an average prophet, for he raises three dead people:

>a young girl (Matthew 9:1819), a young man (Luke 7: 11-15), and a man named Lazarus (John 11: 1-44).

The Jews believed that only *God* could control the weather to induce storms and stop them, so they were amazed when *Jesus* stopped a storm (Matthew 8:23-27).

There are also accounts of *Jesus* \- or Yeshua - as he was known - walking on water, exorcising evil spirits from possessed people, healing the sick and crippled, restoring the sight of blind people, turning water into wine, and feeding the multitudes (on two different occasions).  


All of these supernatural acts proved *Jesus* was no ordinary human being, and he himself said the Kingdom or realm he came from was 'not of this world'. He also maintained that his father was in the heavens, and he spent many lengthy periods in the vast isolation of the Sinai Desert, where he may have received the instructions for his revolutionary program to change civilization.

Perhaps this was the rendezvous point for meeting his extraterrestrial kin. There are many instances of luminous objects descending onto *Jesus* and shining rays at him. All of these incidents are interpreted as religious omens among the primitive people of the time, but what can we make of them?

For example, in Luke 3: 21-22, it is recorded:

>Now, when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that *Jesus* was also being baptized and praying, the heaven was opened. And the *Holy Ghost* descended in a bodily shape *like a* *dove* upon him.

What was this thing which resembled a luminous dove? We are none the wiser now. Nor can we explain the significance of the following episode, mentioned in detail in Matthew 17: 6-9:

>*Jesus* too Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to pray. And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his rainment was white and glistening. And behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias; who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.  
   
But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. And it came to pass as they departed from him, Peter said unto *Jesus*, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.  
   
While thus he spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, 'This is my beloved Son: hear him.' And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were sore afraid, And *Jesus* came and touched them and said Arise and be not afraid.  
   
And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save *Jesus* only. And as they came down from the mountain, *Jesus* charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead.  
   
And they kept it close, and told not man in those days of the things which they had seen.  
   
Why did *Jesus* ask the disciples to keep quiet about the incident?  
How did Peter, John And James know the figures with *Jesus* were Moses and Elias, who lived a thousand years before they were born?  
And what mysterious process was going on during the miraculous transformation of *Jesus*, which made his face and clothes 'brighter than the sun'?  
What mysterious forces were at work on the summit of that mountain?  
Was *Jesus* being 'recharged' by some energy source hidden in the cloud which hovered overhead?

So many intriguing, but alas, unanswered questions.  


Of course, the ultimate proof that *Jesus* was no ordinary Earthman came with his physical resurrection, which was mentioned in all four gospels and referred to in Corinthians 15: 3-7.

Mark relates that *Jesus* of Nazareth was scourged and treated brutally by the Roman guards, who crowned him with thorns, mocked him, then *crucified* him at the ninth hour (3 p.m.) of the day. *Jesus* had to be *buried* before the Sabbath began at 6 p.m., so that his corpse should not profane the holy day.

A secret disciple of *Jesus* named Joseph of Arimathea, bravely asked the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate if he could bury *'Christ'*.

Pilate was surprised that *Jesus* had died so quickly, and after checking with his centurion to see if *'Christ'* had indeed passed away, he allowed Joseph to take charge of the preacher's body.  


Joseph wrapped the corpse of *'Christ'* in a fine linen; this cloth was afterwards rumored to feature a miraculous imprint of the body of *'Christ'*, and some think the burial cloth is still around as the famous *Turin Shroud*. The shrouded body of *Jesus* was hurriedly laid in a sepulchre hewn out of a rock, and the entrance to this tomb was sealed with an enormous stone.

There can be no doubt that at this point, *Jesus* was not faking death, although some researchers have claimed that [he had not died on the cross](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biblianazar/esp_biblianazar_16.htm), but had only swooned.

But the facts say that was not possible, for a Roman scourging was so terrible and traumatic, many victims died before being crucified. Then there is the graphic account of John, who says a soldier named Longinius thrust a spear into *Jesus*'s side while he was on the cross and that 'blood and water' came out.

This is a medically accurate description of what happens when the pericardium is pierced, and such a wound is always fatal.  


Shortly before dawn on the Sunday morning following the Jewish Sabbath (which is a Saturday), Mary Magdalene went to visit the tomb where *Jesus* was laid to rest, and noticed that the heavy stone had been rolled back.

In John 20: 1-9 it states:

>The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom *Jesus* loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.  
   
Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.  
   
And he, stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying, yet went he not in. Then cometh Simon Peter, following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, And the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. Then went in also that other disciple, which first came unto the sepulchre, and he saw, and believe.  
   
For as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead.

The events of that first Easter morning soon came together like a mystical jigsaw puzzle.

The Jewish Council, the Sanhedrin, trembled when they heard the news of the empty tomb. They heard strange accounts of how, in the early hours of that Sunday morning a being in 'snow-white clothes' with a light on its head as bright as lightning had descended from the low oppressive clouds and terrified the Roman soldiers guarding the tomb of *'Christ'* into stupefaction.

This strange figure - assumed by the Jewish priests to be a heavenly being - an angel of some order - proceeded to push away the stone blocking the tomb's entrance with superhuman might. It was later revealed that two unearthly-looking men dressed in white clothes had been seen at the entrance of the tomb by Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome.

The three women said one of the eerie figures said:

>'Be not affrighted; ye seek *Jesus* of Nazareth, which was crucified. He is not here... he is risen. But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.'

The enigmatic men in white later vanished into the skies as mysteriously as they had appeared. Did they return to some mothership in Earth orbit? The ship that had been interpreted as the Star of Bethlehem?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[The doubter, Thomas inspects the wounds of the resurrected Jesus](https://preview.redd.it/qg3yrghxw2m41.jpg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=728820a41fe2090597e1ffecd0a1bb4daf0c4025)

 

The resurrected *Jesus* later reappeared to his faithful disciples, but seems to have undergone a 'transfiguration'.

Although he was apparently solid and tangible enough to eat food and to allow the disciples to touch his wounds, doors did not have to be opened before he could enter a room full of people. He [bilocated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilocation) on several occasions (allowed himself to be seen in several places at once simultaneously), and seemed slightly different.

Some people who had been familiar with him prior to the crucifixion did not recognize him immediately; in fact even Mary Magdalene mistook him for a gardener. Luke mention this intriguing facial metamorphoses when he relates the two disciples' walk to Emmaus, seven miles outside Jerusalem. *'Christ'* joins them but says 'there eyes were holden that they should not know him'.

The disciples told the bemused *Jesus* about the crucifixion and of the empty tomb he had been laid in. *Jesus* then revealed his identity be expounding the scriptures concerning himself.

The overawed disciples shared their evening meal with him, and he blessed them and broke the bread. He subsequently performed a vanishing act, and the disciples hurried back to Jerusalem to tell of their emotional and heart-lifting encounter with the risen *'Christ'*. The eleven Apostles, meanwhile were giving their accounts of meetings with the returned *Jesus*, when their Lord suddenly appeared in their midst.  


After the ghostlike *'Christ'* had instilled faith into his followers, he is said to have 'ascended' into heaven.

The Christian Bible doesn't go into any detail about what this ascension was like, but we possess thought-provoking accounts of the event in the [Apocryphon Jacobi](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/nag_hammadi/apocjn.htm), and the Epistle of the Apostles. These books, which *were* *suppressed* *by the Church for centuries*, give us a full description of the *Ascension*. They tell us that at the ridge, east of Jerusalem, known as the Mount of Olives, where *Jesus* often prayed and meditated in the evenings, there was a great stir.

The *resurrected* *Jesus* of Nazareth was talking to his followers, when his words were interrupted by a clap of thunder and lightning. The roll of rumbling thunder shook the entire mountain, and a chariot descended through the clouds. The Jews of old called this chariot a *Merkaba* \- a *celestial vehicle* of the angels which is mentioned in the *ancient Kabbals.*

The texts describe how *Jesus* entered the *Merkaba* and was welcomed by the angels within who were dressed in 'white apparel'.

One of these heavenly beings said to the apostles:

>Men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same *Jesus*, which is taken from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go to heaven.

And the Apostles watched in wonderment as *Jesus* rose higher and higher into the heavens until he and his angels in the Merkaba were lost to sight.  


Today, the Christians assert that *Jesus* was *God* incarnate, while the Jews maintain that he was merely a prophet. Whoever *Jesus* was, there can be no doubt that he was a most extraordinary, and possibly extraterrestrial being. How else can we explain the miracles he performed, the transfiguration, and eventually regeneration after being executed on the cross?

Then there is the futuristic philosophy *Jesus* propounded which predates the doctrines of Communism formulated by **Marx** and **Engels** by centuries. *Jesus* said that it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven, and he also said that in his kingdom, the underdog and the wretched would be put first (which enraged the self-righteous Pharisees).

He told his astonished followers that pacifism was the only way to live; if their enemy should strike them them, they must turn the other cheek, ready to be hit again. This seemed to be the exact opposite of the Old Testament's suggestion of 'an eye for an eye' and more in keeping with Ghandi's philosophy of non-violence which lay nine centuries in the future.

*Jesus* also preached that those who wished to follow him would have to love their enemies and pray for them, and abandon all worldly wealth. The strange philosophy of *'Christ'* seems so alien to the selfish nature of the human race; was this because *'Christ'* was an alien? Because the whole subject of *Jesus* and his teachings is still surrounded with so many blind dogmas and taboos, it is difficult to see beyond the religion and analyze just who or what the carpenter from Nazareth really was.

The extraterrestrial interpretation does not denigrate *'Christ'* in any way, but shows him in another, wider role in the cosmos.

The next time you gaze up into the night sky at the stars, consider that somewhere out there, for all we know, an interstellar *'Christ'* may be preaching the word of [Yahveh](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biblianazar/esp_biblianazar_jehovah.htm) to the multitudes of some alien world.

For the seeker of occult powers, the Illuminati, the Cabal, et caterva; the following publication contains a lot of key data. It's a great read for beginners and truth-seekers alike.

I just listened to an Interview with Mark Passio and Jay Parker, in which Jay discusses his upbringing and formation within a satanic family, what he describes as the “minions” of the 13 Families that govern the destinies of the planet. The leader of Earth's Illuminati is called “Pindar” Pindar is a member of one of the 13 ruling royal families of the Illuminati, and is always male. The title, Pindar, is an abbreviated term for ""Pinnacle of the Draco"", also known as ""Penis of the Dragon"". The Illuminati dates back to the times of Atlantis and the black magic they practiced sank that continent….

&#x200B;

Kabbalah Explained: Reptilian Aliens and the Planetary Council of 13 'Royal Families'

Parker reveals that the ""myth"" of the existence of the Illuminati (""Illuminated"") dates back around 200,000 years to the Annunaki Manipulation, from which the ruling families maintained ""royal"" bloodlines reaching into modern times. I cannot confirm the validity of this claim, but there are many intriguing correlations revealed below.

{\*Cabala (or Cabal) is the name of an occult science linked to KHAZAR Judaism, but it is also a term used to mean plot, gang, secret intrigue, conspiracy, etc. To avoid confusion with the figurative meaning, some scholars argue that the correct pronunciation of the philosophical doctrine (occult science) in Portuguese is “kabbalah”, not “kabbalah” (as pronounced in the original Hebrew “qabbalah”)}.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vt5i38eojby91.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c2ec76a55443d5a9a00acd702986f5edfc249d31

The leader of Earth's Illuminati is called ""Pindar"". The Pindar is a member of one of the 13 ruling royal families of the Illuminati, and is always male. The title, Pindar, is an abbreviated term for ""Pinnacle of the Draco"", also known as ""Penis of the Dragon"". Symbolically, this represents the height of power, control, creation, penetration, expansion, invasion and control by fear (the apex of satanic patriarchy).

The holder of this classification reports to the reptilian leader of the giant reptilians Draco Royal White of pure reptilian race (whites) from the star system of Thubal, from DRACO, in the Constellation of the Dragon (Draco), which have bases on the Moon and Mars from where they govern, manipulate and control the “reality” created and implanted by them in the Matrix control system (mind control) of the ignorant masses here on Earth.

Recently, there have been reports that the Marquis de Libeaux is Pindar, but this is disinformation. The real and current Pindar is the head of the Rothschild family, as he has been for several hundred years. It is based in Germany near Frankfurt. In the late 1970s, he oversaw the sister project of the Montauk mind control program called M.A.L.D.A., which is an anagram for Montauk-Alsace-Lorraine Dimensional Activation. This project was located near the city of Strasbourg, France, historically, since its territory was an integral part of Germany.

Interestingly, there is a winery on the east end of Long Island, not far from Montauk Point, called Pindar Vineyards. This wine is growing in popularity, earning “international praise”. This fits the plan well as this area will be part of the Capital District of Earth/United Nations in the Imperial State (NWO style global government)! Red wine is symbolic of the blood ingested by reptilians. Wine can become “sanctified” as it happens in the rituals of the Roman Catholic Church, a hoax by the Reptilians. In the Catholic Church, wine replaced blood in ceremonies, such as at Mass.

&#x200B;

The Illuminati here on Earth have established a pyramidal structure of control identical to the system that exists in the Draconian Empire. The pyramid with the reptilian eye, located on the American one dollar bill, symbolizes this control structure. The eye is the top of the pyramid, which explains why the original surface of the Great Pyramid in Egypt was covered in solid gold in a miniature pyramid.

The Pindar is represented by the golden top of the pyramid. The next layer, or ""eye"", in the pyramid represents the 13 ruling families of the Matrix Control System. They are as follows:

&#x200B;

Rothschild (Bauer or Bower) – The Pindar

Bruce

Cavendish (Kennedy)

de Medici

Hanover

Habsburg

Krupp

plantagenet

rockefeller

Romanov

Sinclair (St. Clair)

Warburg (from the Bank)

Windsor (Saxe-Coburg-Gothe)

&#x200B;

Each of the 13 ruling families was given an area of ​​Earth and/or a particular role to play on Earth. These specific roles include global finance, technology/military development, mind control, religion, politics, culture and entertainment, sports and media.

&#x200B;

""And to Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and the name of his brother was Joktan."" Genesis 10:25

&#x200B;

Each of the 13 ruling families also has a 13-member Council. The number, 13, has great meaning for them. They know that there are 12 types of energies that pass through the 10 aspects of God-Mind. The totality of the 12 energies is equal to their sum in a 13th energy. This is considered the most powerful occult and esoteric knowledge.

They also know that there really are 13 Zodiac signs, not just the 12 recognized by common sense. They kept the 13th sign hidden for centuries because it is the sign of the Constellation Draco (Dragon). They keep the qualities and traits of this sign secret to avoid giving clues to the reptilian mind pattern.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The next layer is the second command family that does the support work for Pindar and the 13 ruling families. While all 13 ruling family members have the ability to SHAPESHIFTING (change from reptilian to human appearance), all other members of the 300 supporting families do not. However, they all have a high percentage of reptilian DNA.

\[Alexander: In my opinion, if so-called shapeshifting really exists, then it's nothing more than advanced technology put to work, and we still can't understand that. Alternatively, it could be a type of misunderstood possession – for a better reference, you can imagine reptilian extraterrestrials using human bodies as vehicles, similar to how humans used Na’vis bodies in the movie Avatar\].

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/46r0om45kby91.png?width=194&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=46d813ea95cee348305e8833cf2a1d71fefe3d15

They are known as the “Committee of 300.” (These families include such notable names as Agnelli, Balliol, Beale, Bell, Bouvier, Bush, Cameron, Campbell, Carnegie, Carrington, Coolidge, Delano, Douglas, Ford, Gardner, Graham, Hamilton, Harriman, Heinz, Kuhn, Lindsay Loeb, Mellon, Montgomery, Morgan, Norman, Oppenheimer, Rhodes, Roosevelt, Russell, Savoy, Schiff, Seton, Spencer, Stewart / Stuart, Taft and Wilson.

The Committee of 300 uses many well-known institutions to achieve its goals, including the Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderbeg Group, Trilateral Commission, Club of Rome, Royal Institute for International Affairs, Mafia, CIA, NSA, Mossad, Secret Service, Fund International Monetary, Federal Reserve Bank system, Internal Revenue Service (Income Tax) and Interpol, CIA, FBI, etc… to name a few. All of these are private organizations or corporations configured as public service devices, but this is far from the truth, as they act as an instrument of control and implementation of the reptilian-Illuminati agenda of total control of the planet and implantation of a totalitarian global government (something like exists in North Korea, a large Illuminati laboratory).

The Illuminati structure also artificially and through revolutions creates countries to further its goals. Examples of this are the United States, Switzerland, Kuwait, the Soviet Union, Panama, ISRAEL, Italy, Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom, most of Black Africa, all Arab countries, and all of Central and South America.

These nations were created to control their natural resources and accumulate wealth for the ruling families and their supporters, hide or keep their wealth, and create the unstable conditions necessary to start wars and increase their control and influence through large expenditures on military budgets.

Switzerland was created as a neutral banking center so that Illuminati families and their associates would have a safe place to keep their funds without fear of destruction from wars and prying eyes. The United States was established with 13 colonies, one for each of the Illuminati families. The original flag had 13 stars, and it still has 13 stripes. The eagle, the symbol of the United States, has 13 arrows in its talons.

The United States is actually a corporate business asset of the former Virginia Company, which was established in 1604 in England, with direct involvement of the Rothschilds. Rothschild finances were needed to finance the exploration and occupation of the North American continent.

The assets of the Virginia Company, including the United States, are owned by the Holy Roman Empire through the Vatican. This was in 1213 when King James gave all English resources to the reptilian Pope on duty in Rome. The Ministry of Education remains with the British royal family, but real estate is in the Roman Catholic Church.

The United States of America is not named after Amerigo Vespucci, as you learned in school. The Illuminati would never name a continent, actually two continents, after an Italian mapmaker. The name is actually a combination of words.

&#x200B;

“Am” is the Hebrew word for “people”

“Ame” is also the command form of the Spanish/Latin verb “to love”

“Eri” or “ari” is a Hebrew term for “lion”

“Rica” is the feminine form of the Spanish word for “rich”

“Ka” is the ancient Egyptian word for the soul, or spiritual force within a body.

There are two layers of meanings. Ancient Hebrew/Egyptian translates to say “the lion people (descendants of the Hebrews) with spiritual strength”.

&#x200B;

\[Alexandre: Personally, I believe that the name of America was derived from the Peruvian “AMARUCA”, which meant “The land of flying SNAKES” (i.e. reptilians)\]. Hence, the pyramid and the whole eye on the dollar bill. The Latinized version translates to say “riches of love”, in a feminine/physical way. This gives you an idea of ​​what they had in mind. Take it a step further, and you see the blending of the feminine ideas of Latin/eagle with the masculine ideas of Hebrew/lion. America's symbolic statement is that it is a combination of Lemuria and Atlantis; a mixture of the human/Lyra beings (Greys) with Draco Reptilians. Perhaps the anagram LSD, a drug created by the Illuminati, also has a hidden meaning: Lyrae-Sirius-Draco!

The combination of these three civilizations would produce the most powerful technological Empire ever known in the area of multiple star systems neighboring our solar system!

In 1776, the creation of the United States as an independent nation coincided with the declaration into public existence of the official Illuminati organization by its member Adam Weishaupt, in Bavaria, Germany. Publicly, Mr. Weishaupt appeared to be determined to create an organization composed of the European elite that would elevate humanity. Of course, this was part of a global Illuminati ceremony. The Creation of the United States and the Global Illuminati Ceremony. The creation of the United States and the Illuminati organization were artificial beginnings for public consumption.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/695bnn0ekby91.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fce675793950a2f0515ece0e312ef2637ba4cace

The United States was the device to be used to bring the Illuminati into public acceptance. Current members of the Illuminati believe that Adam Weishaupt looked like George Washington and is actually an image of Weishaupts that appears on the one dollar bill. George Washington was a wealthy slave and plantation owner. He is known to have raped some of his female slaves and used some of the male slaves in ritual ceremony. There are many people of the black race who can literally trace their genetics back to the founding fathers of the USA, almost all of them MASONS.

George Washington also ordered the construction of the Montauk Lighthouse in 1796. This lighthouse included an underground storage area for stockpile in case of invasion of the British coast. If he only knew what this area would become today – or maybe he already knew?

The 13 ruling Illuminati families constantly seek to vie for control with each other. During this time period, the Spanish, British, and French Illuminati fought to gain control over North and South America.

The Rothschilds kept these Illuminati factions in line by sending in Hessian troops to monitor the situation. The leaders enjoyed these war games, pitting one against the other to see who would win. The hundreds of thousands of lives lost were meaningless to them. The Manifest Destiny of the United States was created to expand the territory of the Aryans at the expense of the native populations. As always, the Illuminati seeks to destroy native peoples and their cultures and thus seize their natural riches and exploit them for the benefit of their agendas.

This is an attempt to destroy your knowledge of God-Mind, as well as the ability of the natives to transmit this information to others. Especially important is the need to eliminate native cultures with ancient knowledge of Atlantis, Lyra, Pleiades, Sirius (Dogons in Africa) Draco, Lacerta, Arcturus, Alpha Centauri and several other neighboring star systems.

The natives who gave them the most trouble were the Cherokee Indians because this tribe retains most of their Atlantean knowledge, even accessing the Bear/Bigfoot frequency for information. For this reason, these people were uprooted from their homeland in the southern Appalachian mountains, and forced to settle into Oklahoma lands for what is known as The Trail of Tears.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q0r0ta7gkby91.png?width=297&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c620c82813dc0dc965277d3936eb6dcd33a20ed3

Many died along the way. Only a remnant remained in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. In the north, the vast Iroquois/Mohawk nation was dissolved. The Montauk, direct descendants of the Atlanteans who call their leader Pharaoh, were systematically eliminated. The Rothschilds were aggressively involved in the African slave trade, importing slaves to North and South America as well as the Caribbean. They were very careful not to import blacks from the eastern areas of Ethiopia or Sudan where Solomon's descendants were located, concentrating on western and central Africa to obtain their slave populations.

These areas possessed the pure mix of Anunnaki and ape ape genetics, and desirable programming for the Illuminati agenda.

The Rothschilds decided that dividing up the US colonies would double their profits. So they politically created and financially supported the Civil War. The Civil War was actually a global ceremonial ritual to bring slavery to the next level. This war allowed the North to win and publicly abolished slavery.

The best slaves are those who do not realize that they are slaves (the bondage of the MIND). This alleviates rebellion and resistance. This was the status immediately after the Civil War. Blacks in the south are still slaves. Segregation still exists, even in the North. The Illuminati still regard blacks as second or third class citizens. Only now slavery is subtle and masked.

Those in power consider us useless EATERS and have used divide and conquer techniques (Divide et Impera) against us to prevent us from uniting and being able to use resistance. What we “ALL” need to keep in mind is that once “the base” (we the PEOPLE) of the pyramid came together, the rest would collapse.

Since the Civil War, there have been other organized wars that have entrenched the trend towards globalization. The Spanish-American War of 1898-1899 acquired more territory for the American Illuminati, placing a greater portion of the Earth's surface under North American jurisdiction.

World War I was designed to change the map of Europe, as well as test germination and chemical warfare technology for future use. This coincided with the worldwide flu outbreak designed to reduce the global population, making the rest easier to control. World War I also laid the groundwork for the German role and emergence of Nazism in the next war.

The Second World War was a testament to the final projects of globalization and extermination. It was also designed to test mind control machines; to test the use of fluoride which dampens brain activity, prevents the development of the Pineal Gland (the “Third Eye, spiritual vision) and retards resistance to authority; to experience slave labor camps and study the development of resistance; and teaching the masses to spy and report to one another.

 World War II brought three major Illuminati goals to fruition. The first was that the hidden symbolism of the Illuminati was brought to public attention from underground strongholds in Tibet and Egypt, such as the use of the sacred Hindu symbol, the Swastika by the Nazis and the Ankh (symbol of Life in ancient Egypt). The second was the creation of the State of Israel as the basis for the emergence of a New Religion and the center of World domination of the Khazar Jews. The last was the creation of nuclear weapons as part of the global Illuminati ceremony.

[Sexual depravity, pedophilia, corruption of the feminine and use of sex slaves is part of the reptilian-Illuminati agenda.](https://preview.redd.it/15dnvufpkby91.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba871275ffe71821bb53136498afd9a3a64512e7)

During World War II, the Germans helped to perfect the use of “sex slaves” as a means of transmitting information among the elite. Sex slaves can be male or female, who are sexually programmed using Wilhelm Reich's procedures, which are illegal (but widely used in secret projects developed by the Deep State) in the United States, but used by the Illuminati and the government.

These sex slaves deliver messages and keep mentally programmed sleepers in line. The sex slave is activated with a message or function through various drugs and sexual rituals (vampirization of the sacred Kundalini sexual energy), which can only be disseminated by repeating the same sexual act with the target or person to be activated. They are trained to know your target's trigger words and trigger events to activate, delete or change the schedule.

One of the biggest, if not the main sex slave used by the reptilian-Illuminati control system was the ""bombshell"" - platinum blonde MARILYN MONROE, who was always at the center of the main US crises, during the JFK government, having been the lover of both. Kennedy brothers, among so many other “important” men both murdered, as well as herself, being eliminated at just 36 years old.

In recent years, several women have come forward claiming to have been sex slaves of major political figures recognized worldwide. Many were used as messengers of information between high-ranking Illuminati politicians. Generally, the appearances of political figures are used in fledgling programming as a focal point for the sex slave.

The slave is subjected to a process of desensitization, so there is no pleasure in the sexual act; it is merely a duty to be performed. Often, the slave becomes sexually promiscuous, repeatedly having sex with people who look like the intended target. It is a sad life that leads to a great compromise in the evolution of the individual's soul, as invariably these beings are possessed by reptilian entities and/or are implanted with alien material.

At the end of World War II, one of the three major global Illuminati rituals was performed. This was the nuclear explosion that took place in 1945 at the 33rd parallel as a test for the nuclear attack on Japan. This explosion was symbolic, representing the simultaneous creation and destruction of matter and energy.

The year was also symbolic. In numerology, 1 + 9 = 10, representing the 10 aspects of God-Mind. The number 10 further divides to 1 + 0 = 1, representing a new beginning, also the masculine (1 the phallus) and the feminine (zero, the Uterus). Continuing, 4 + 5 = 9, representing the end of a cycle. Symbolically, the entire event represented the end of a cycle to prepare for a new beginning using the new creation of God-Mind out of destruction.

In addition, a cylinder containing material not yet explained by the government was transported for nuclear explosion testing. This cylinder was made of pure steel and was supposed to be the same physical dimension that the Kabbalah describes for creating Golems. Kabbalah is ancient Hebrew metaphysics that has been an instrument of use for the Illuminati for millennia. Golems are artificial beings that are used as a slave force. It is highly likely that this is a symbolic ritual for the creation of a society of Golems (slaves).

World War II also allowed the European/American Illuminati to destroy the Japanese Illuminati's desires for global domination. The Japanese royal family, represented by Emperor Hirohito, has always been ostracized as not legitimated by the 13 Aryan families of Europe (descendants of the Anunnakis). The Japanese claim to be direct descendants of purebred Lemurians and Reptilians (from Draco).

The European/American Illuminati claim that the Japanese Illuminati are descended from a lower (caste) species in the Draco reptilian hierarchy. This inferior species is considered a working class and soldiers without political influence and power of command.

The European/American Illuminati also claim that the East Indians are a lower species in the Draco hierarchy. The 13 ruling families consider fair skin and hair to be a characteristic of the ruling elite. On January 17, 1994, Japan sent a seismic event to California. Exactly one year later, on January 17, 1995, the city of Kobe, Japan, was seismically destroyed by a massive earthquake.

Kobe was home to Japan's electromagnetic weapons centers. The European/American Illuminati will not tolerate thorns in their flanks. The destruction of Japan and its royal family will continue for months to come.

Every year, the Illuminati hold meetings (Bilderberg Group) to plan the events of the coming year to accomplish their main goal, formulated millennia ago of TOTAL global control and domination. In the 1850s, they identified their target date for complete domination with an agenda called Plan 2000. This was revised in 2003.

The rigged presidential election that elected the reptilian George W. Bush Jr. as US President, and the subsequent “terrorist bombing” on the WTC Twin Towers in N. York on 9/11/2001 was a key sign that they are pursuing their agenda. The public lesson of the 2000 US presidential “election” is that citizens don't vote for anyone! Even the Illuminati are now finding it increasingly difficult to hide their plans and real intentions.

Many won't understand and many will mock. But how do you explain something that is infinitely complex and fractally connected? I will try to explain the best I can.

This started as just a comment on the post that showed the media putting a halo behind Biden's head in pictures. And evolved from there. 

.

It symbolizes the crown. The crown symbolizes aligning the Kundalini using the knowledge of the forbidden fruit given by the snake (caduceus) to attain the all seeing eye. It has always been a symbol of the serpent and tyrannical rulers, kingship (crown), and Ophites (Greek: snake). Also considered connecting the snake and the bird making the feathered serpent or dragon that requires human sacrifice or the holocaust (cost of the halo). 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_(symbolism)

Note: some details would be wrong for me to explain further 

It takes a huge amount of research to understand what is hidden. Those that align the energy centers get magical powers like Harry potter and some become evil rulers. Without explaining it all... Everything is frequency and you can think of it as changing the radio station you are tuned into to get more. 

Then they use the knowledge of frequency to mess with our brain waves and keep us dumb and subservient (magic) and feed off of our energy like parasites (Archons). There is a hidden world, but the wool (frequency) has been pull over your eyes. Your eyes just perceive light and light can be manipulated in many ways.  By holding a resonator (globe with a cross on top) in the left hand and a septor (magic wand) in the right hand the energy crosses their heart to give them their hearts desire/will (magic). Other methods exist but this one is easy to spot in history.  This is done by stealing the energy/will of others and accumulating it. Mainly from human sacrifice and war. This type of energy is conducted by water and stone to resonator condensers which are buildings that are designed with crystal geometry (cathedrals and temples). You have to understand that everything in the universe is connected and can be understood in the dielectric and resonant principals. No metal conductor is needed.

Research info on this part of the subject https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5vXBfxN7rxKeJHJxS8dNDw

What if you could build a pyramid with the perfect shape and alignment to resonate at the same frequency as a star or planet that crosses over it? But whether they realize it or not they are also drawing from the resonant harmony that holds the universe together which causes the great floods every so often.   Symbolized by the suffering of Christ and Hercules knocking down the pillars. The Pillars of Creation, the source of life energy. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Creation

I think that is the issue. If they don't sacrifice humans the energy is taken from the pillars. Which is the reason of never ending wars. 

The time is near. Jesus was the coming of the age of Pisces. The age of Aquarius the water bearer comes 2,160 years after Jesus. It is hard to pinpoint because the Catholic church (head of the snake) controlled our understanding of time and the year for so long. 

But can't you feel it? We live in a crystal matrix, a fractal in which everything from the micro to the macro is a mirror of each other.  The political turmoil is a direct reflection or the astrological. And it all goes to a tipping point of the elections in the 13th zodiac of Ophiuchus  the ""Serpent-bearer"". The 13th is the transition period between the 12 symbolized in the last supper. 

> The constellation is described in the astrological poem of Marcus Manilius as the one that winds in loops: ""But, bending its supple neck, the serpent looks back and returns: and the other's hands slide over the loosened coils. The struggle will last forever, since they wage it on level terms with equal powers"".[2] Later in his poem, he describes the astrological influence of Ophiuchus, when the constellation is in its rising phase, as one which offers affinity with snakes and protection from poisons, saying ""he renders the forms of snakes innocuous to those born under him. They will receive snakes into the folds of their flowing robes, and will exchange kisses with these poisonous monsters and suffer no harm"".[3] A later 4th century astrologer, known as Anonymous of 379, associated ""the bright star of Ophiuchus"", Ras Alhague (α Ophiuchi), with doctors, healers or physicians (ἰατρῶν), **which may have been because of the association between poisons and medicines.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiuchus_(astrology)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpens


So the vaccine. The serpent. And for the short time you will be able to kiss the snake with no harm... They will rearrange your energy centers (the mark of the beast) which is a change in your DNA. Your DNA is your frequency antenna. We are carbon based life forms with 6 protons 6 neutrons and 6 electrons.   It has something to do with the decay of the carbon atom, but I can't find that part back. 

Then comes Aquarius right on time, shortly after the new president takes office and the mass vaccinations. The whole universe can be explained by just the procession of the sun. The infinity symbol with one side larger than the other. A continual expansion and contraction. The life breath. 


So the change is said to make the first the last and the meek will inherit the earth. The frequency will shift and those that have rearranged their energy center for power or were tricked into taking the mark will become animals or clay as in the story of Nebuchadnezzar. Which is also associated with the donkey and jackass. The democrat party?

27,Musings on the coming New World Order... Jupiter/Saturn conjunctions....Thots?,35.0,jrwkm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jrwkm7/musings_on_the_coming_new_world_order/,16.0,1605051795.0,"So everyone here is familiar with the concept of “The New World Order”.

Here’s the thing though, not many people are that familiar with the rise and fall of “World Orders”.

Now the question of, is this the last world order or “End Times”, would be a theological question which is important, but, even theologians mostly agree noone can know the “day or hour”. 

For our purposes we are rationally (not that religion is irrational, just asking to stay focused on the “World” for a moment. ) looking at facts, how they correlate to the coming shift in world order.

Now, I grew up discussing these things, always been waiting for the “times”.

Since I’ve grown older I’ve dived deep into q lot of occult practices.

Now we also all know the elite are very invested in occult knowledge.

So before you think to discount me, take a noment to consider, that these occult practices they are into, are very real, and astrology is the backbone of it all.

Now, I won’t overwealm you with technical astrological terms, but essentially by observing celestial cycles you can predict the rise and fall of world orders.

So it works like this, Jupiter and Saturn appear to move slowest out of the visible planets, therefore they align rarely to the eye. 

Unlike Sun and Moon who obviously align once a month (New Moon), it takes Jupiter and Saturn aprox. 20 years.

So ancient astrologers (and some of us today) understand that the slow changes of Celestial bodies (Jupiter and Saturn) correspond to the slow moving, but big, global changes, permanent changes.

The faster bodies Sun and Moon, correspond to more fast, observable, and common changes in the world. (As above so below)

So Jupiter and Saturn conjoin (align for lack of better synonym) every 20 years, and doing so, they conjoin in signs of the zodiac that are of the same element for aprox. 240 years.

This means, for 240 years they conjoin every 20 years therein, in fire signs (Leo, Sagitary, Aries), Earth, Air, Water, so on forever.

(Thank you for sticking with me and reading this, you are now up to speed!)

Now in 1981, 2000, and again Dec 21 2020, are the most recent Jupiter/Saturn Conjunctions.

1981 was when they shifted from the Earthy triplicity, into the Airy triplicity, but it isn’t that simple, as in 2000 they regressed back into an Earth sign, to again conjoin in an Air sign, which will contine in Air signs for aprox 240 years.

This clearly shows the change of world order and a clinging onto of the old.

Now you can observe these cycles and see how world culture and order, everything, has evolved over time. 

These cycles also correspond to deaths of presidents and world leaders.

A shift into the Firey triplicity brought major world changing revolutionary wars from aprox. 1603-1782.

Then in aprox. 1802 they shifted into the Earthy, bringing industrial revolution, materialism.

The shift into the airy triplicity starts proper, on Dec. 21 2020, but has already begun, it’s already been creating massive changes in world order.

The shift into the Airy signs currently is all about tech, humanity, space travel, all the “unheard” of curiosities we discuss here, think of all that which the 80’s up to 2000 brought, but then suddenly went sorta quiet, no major visible progress, seeming stagnation.

This shift is also about restrictions but taboo liberties.

 (drugs and sex work will be legal and who knows what else but you won’t be able to text the call girl without you partner finding out, because, 0 privacy, and stiffled individualism, yet freedom to express ourselves in strange and taboo ways, the future is bleak yes. We will be constantly monitered, everything will be centralized.)

Yet now these wild techs are front and center, developed, in our face fucking Moon base for crying out loud, ready to tag us. 

So, now armed with knowledge, it stands to reason, by the using the very same philosophies of the elite, we can discern what changes are coming, “The New World Order”.

This shift is similar to two other shifts in world order, lastly from 1206-1385 (this one looking eerily similar to our current shift; reigning in the Renaissance period, also, this period saw the “black death”).

Before that 412-580 (which saw the fall of the Western Roman Empire)

We also know why they knew it was coming. They saw it in the stars long ago.

They did their best to make you think magic was only a fairy tale.

Now they stand to capitilze on the change and consolidate power. The big question I’m not sure if “they” had a big pow wow on it yet, “who is gonna be on top of this pyramid?”

Good question, which brings us right back front and center to Merica!

Ok so option A.

Trump really is an outsider, opposed to the globalist and NWO agenda. He, for whatever reason, has taken it upon himself to pull q last minute rescue of America, for America.

Option B.

He’s in on it (NWO) and playing his hand.

Option C.

A. is true and he loses the election, Kamala and Biden take office, we are back to our dirty biz in the mid east, they try and brand us and track us like whales or cattle. Tech takes over. The dystopian nightmare (or literal dream state for some) is here.

A. Is true and he makes a surprise upset (not that all will be upset about it!) and wins!...
Fire breaks out across America, the liberal occupiers will do what they do, we end up on the verge or of or in, an all out domestic war, big tech keeps moving to China, we still get vaccinated, branded and tagged.

Option B is truly the wild (Trump) card, and at this point seems most likely, but will at first at least have the appearence either of A options, or perhaps neither. If he is in on it then this whole thing is so orchestrated to disturb and upset global order that it will be blatantly obvious. (Order from Chaos)

If he loses, NWO wins, the so called “New World Order” is literally written in the stars.

If he wins, NWO still wins. The thing is though, at this point, it really looks as if they want this moment to be as devastating as possible to the psyche. Yes the plague is real, but it has been politicised and even weaponized (it literally is a weapon).

The vaccine is bad news, but doesn’t matter who puts it on us, both illusions of choice blue and red are ready to stick us and hand us over.

(unless the less likely but still possible scenario that Trump is here to save us)

The old world is just about done. It’s over. They kept us good and distracted while they laid every cornerstone in place. It’s almost time to pull the trigger.

We are simply sitting here trying to figure out who is going to be our new master, and I don’t mean Kamala or Trump, I mean world master.

The world is headed towards a socialist, communist ideology, that can’t be stopped. A world with out borders that is also a prison planet.

The sign of Aquarius (which represents the current shift) also closely represents countries like China and Russia, communist themes are very paralell to the themes of this sign.

In the mean time, astrology may be our best hope at discerning what to expect from this inevitable shift in global order.

Surprisingly there are a lot of mysteries to be found within. So I may focus on those that most will understand and don't require a lot of explanation. 

Links proceeded with ""pic"" means something worth looking at. Those without are to just verify my words. 

Let's start with the fun one. We will start with the thorax. Or Thor's axe. Which is the trunk of your tree. And Thor's axe has the handle being your spine and the blades being you shoulder blades (scapula).

> During the Middle Ages spathula was used to refer to the shoulder blade. Spathula is a diminutive of spatha, with the latter originally meaning broad, two-edged sword without a point, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapula#Spathula/%CE%A3%CF%80%CE%AC%CE%B8%CE%B7

So where is Thor's hammer you ask? Well it's on the front side of course. There is a reason they call it a ""power tie"" . The sternum is weird. Notice the manubrium that looks like the shape of Roman chest armor.    pics  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum

Also the part about the development and fusing of the sternum. Ossification happens to several parts of the body and different time periods and is also a strange thing with timing involved.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification

When you breath your rib cage actually generates some electro-magnet energy (Thor's lightning). And when you yell of course is (Thor's thunder). 

I'm not sure where I read the electro-magnet energy from thew rib cage, but it was on Wikipedia. You are an electrical being, but I don't want to get side tracked by that here. 

.

.

So let's move to the spinal column. The top vertebrae (C1) is named Atlas after the god that holds up the world, cuz he is holding up your big head. There are 7 vertebrae of the cervical spine (neck) correspond to the 7 frequencies of visible color. 

Then is the thoracic spine which are the ones that connect to the ribs, whether true, false, or false and floating ribs. There 12 vertebrae connecting to 12 pair of ribs. Corresponding to the 12 divisions of the Zodiac. 

And then the 5 vertebrae of the lumbar, 5 being the number of the gentile man. Jews may have an extra? 

So 7+12+5=24 The human genome is 23 pairs if you count the XX or XY as one. 24 if you do not. Any kundulini interested people? pics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column#Vertebrae

.

.

There is a whole lot more that has interesting correlation and or connection to the mysteries. I think a lot of the Norse mythology really refers to the body. But I don't have it in me to write out much more. I just leave it with this last one for now. 

Everything you see is upside down and backwards. All of your body's signals are crossed because of the many chiasms the body has. The chiasm of the eyes is most visible though. pics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_chiasm

This is the statue. It doesn't look diabolical, Does it?. It represents Prometheus; a greek titan who defied Zeus, bringing fire to humanity after Zeus forbid it. He was then punished by Zeus and chained to a mountain in the Caucasus, his entrails to be devoured by an eagle by day, and being regenerated by night. In this statue, he's represented ""falling"" from the heavens (represented by the zodiac signs in the ring that surrounds him).
   
**Prometheus didn't fall. Lucifer did.**
   
According to the book of Genesis, Lucifer tempted Eve to eat from the tree of Knowledge, which would make humans as gods. He is said to have fallen from the heavens. Lucifer means ""the lightbearer"".
   
You see, in the mystery teachings (that is the esoteric, hidden religion that has been practiced in many cultures under different names; kabbalah, gnosticism, freemasonry, druidic cults, orphic mysteries, luciferianism, esoteric freemasonry, abydos mysteries, pythagoreanism, taoism, alchemy, hermeticism, yoga, etc.), the meaning of the ""light"" or ""the fire"" is illumination, knowledge,  intellect. Lucifer and Prometheus are the same figure; lightbearers who brought a gift of light to humanity that the gods had kept concealed from them, only to be later punished. And it is through intellect and introspection that man is to become deified.
   
That is why the statue is close to statues of [Adam](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XvHu7KR2suY/TiBb-mhIfoI/AAAAAAAAhpg/M2n7VoZtUV4/s1600/LI-archi-NYC-506b.jpg) and [Eve](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8q36CCvDGGA/TiBcCcPibiI/AAAAAAAAhpo/E0G0WspbTs4/s1600/LI-archi-NYC-509b.jpg). Notice the serpentine thing behind them.
   
That is the secret doctrine of the elite. It is about the deification of man and his union with the divine through knowledge and intellect.

\- Egypt at the time was dominated by three different cults: Cult of Moon (main god Isis), Cult of Sun (main god Ra), and Cult of Saturn (creator god El).   
\- Actions of Akhenaton lead to forming of fusion of these three cults (IS-RA-EL), and he named Aton as the new god of the cult.  
\- All Abrahamic religions (and their conspirational groups such as Jesuits and Freemasons)  are descendants of cult of Aton, which originated in Egypt - you could also say that these religions act as a facade for worshipping the real god associated with the cult.

\- Knowledge of the atonists is gathered/stolen from the druids that took place in the ancient Ireland. After all, here are tombs of pharaohs (at least one) located in Ireland. This connection between ancient Ireland and Egypt is never discussed publicly.

\- All the symbolism used by the elite organisations and their puppets has exoteric and esoteric meaning. Exoteric meaning is the explanation given to the public, esoteric meaning is the meaning intended for the insiders to understand.   
\- The blog explains some of the esoteric symbolism associated with some of the known symbols. For example - the all seeing eye on the pyramid is the eye of Aton. The reasoning behind this is found in the part 10, but I advice you to read them in order.   
\- How astrology and religion has always gone hand in hand. 12 Zodiac signs, 12 Tribes of Israel, 12 Disciples...

\- Blogs Finnish variant is much more throughout and contains some additional stories. Im sorry that I can't share that with you. But I hope this could spark some additional discussion about the topic and some new links to dive in!

33,Was Ted Kaczynski “The Unabomber” also the “Zodiac Killer”? (Creepy Similarities),32.0,o9hxhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/o9hxhg/was_ted_kaczynski_the_unabomber_also_the_zodiac/,16.0,1624877957.0,"I’ve been going down the Ted Kaczynski rabbit hole for a while with everything going on tech wise and his “manifesto” speaking on the evils of it and came across some creepy similarities between him and the “Zodiac Killer” that led me to think they might have been the same person- see below:


Ted Kaczynski, from 1967 to 1969, opened up a business in the Bay Area, while “The Zodiac” operated from 1968 to 1969 there. 

During this period Kaczynski had time to settle in before the start of his rampage. 

Both were unscrupulous killers who enjoyed mocking the authorities and using threats against innocent people to bring their writing to the front pages of newspapers. 

Strangely enough, both of them sent letters with additional stamps to ensure delivery. The handwriting patterns from their letters have striking similarities. 

The shapes of the key letters are very similar and both often use the same expressions. 

This includes starting sentences with ""so"", ""by the way"" and ""prove"", often using duplicate ""is"" sentences. 

Both killers were similarly described and had similar characteristics. 

It was described that the zodiac favored one leg over the other, while Kaczynski's brother described him as so numb that it affected his gait. 

Both also used weapons with flashlights for the blind, rifles and Winchester Western .22 Super X ammunition.

Kaczynski, an ingenious mathematician, would have had the opportunity to create a complex cipher for the coded messages of the zodiac. 

He also has a documented interest in symbols such as the crossed lines of the zodiac on a circle. 

He once signed a yearbook with a similar symbol and wrote a dissertation on the boundary functions of circles. 

A special focus for him was the unit circle, which in turn is a circle with two crossed lines in the middle. 

Kaczynski used the rune of Algiz to mark a campus on which he struck once. The symbol looks like a wrong sign of peace and can represent the life of a tree or a great terror. 

It is again a circle where lines intersect.

This is some of the info I came across while researching and found oddly similar between the two.

What are your thoughts on this? Just wanted to share a theory I was thinking about for a while!

I know of people in high school who obsess over it, constantly using the app to communicate with their friends. Based on the popularity of the app, it's assumed this is a trend across the majority of the United States.

At some point they added in a discover section that has stories of various topics and celebrities. A while back I saw a story that caught me off guard seeing has how so many users are kids and teens. It was about how zodiac signs are correlated to different sex positions and then went into detail explaining. For each position was a cartoon picture of a couple, fully naked, reinacting the position. The story was just so unnecessary and served no purpose seeing as how the information was just made up by whoever wrote it. 

So I started checking the section more frequently and in my opinion it's disturbing. Daily stories about sex, sexuality and other stuff that I consider wildly in inappropriate for kids and even teens. I would assume parents would disapprove and not even allow their children to download the app if they knew what type of garbage snapchat frequently gives them direct access to. 

Maybe this is the new normal, but I'd like to hear others opinions

It is perhaps the most convoluted puzzle to ever exist, a timeline which pits some of today's most dominant dogmas, whether scientific or theological, in an unrelenting war against one another: the history of human civilization and evolution.

Today most would refute the Christian story of Genesis, dubbing it a fictional parable clouded by fantasy and nonsense.

Infamous proponents of *Evolution Theory* or natural selection, such as **Richard Dawkins**, are keen on discrediting the creationist theory, yet even with the powerful backing of the science community evolutionists fall short to provide us with the proper narrative that explains our *leap* from Homo-erectus (our ape-like ancestors) to Homo-sapiens (modern man).

The missing link - our biggest conundrum...  


Today there exists many alternative theories that aim to explain mankind's speedy evolution. The [Ancient Astronaut Theory](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_AAtheory.htm) is perhaps one of the most controversial of the bunch.

This theory takes researchers back in time to the cradle of civilization in the Middle-East, the ancient land of Mesopotamia.

The Sumerian Cuneiform tablets, uncovered in the 17th century, provide modern man with a new understanding of our history. This lost knowledge has been slow to make its way into mainstream thought and is just now beginning to air on television on both the History and Discovery Channels.

Accurately decoding the complicated language of the past has taken archaeologists many decades, but fortunately today these ancient scriptures have come to light for all the public to view.

Access to scripts such as,

>the [Book of Enoch](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_enochbook.htm)  
the [Nag Hamadi Gospels](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/nag_hammadi/contents.htm)  
the Book of Jubilees,

...among other historical texts help to broaden our knowledge base relative to the writings in the Canonical Bible.

Many of these documents predate the Canonical Bible by thousands of years, shedding light on the origins and influences of the familiar stories told therein having an immense influence on Western thought.  
 

&#x200B;

[Clay tablets, dating 2000 years before the Canonical Bible, from Ancient Mesopotamia may hold the answer to mankind's origin.](https://preview.redd.it/hlqik7jlede41.jpg?width=380&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34563f63259f1fad1482a635674c4b52481f3d6d)

Many would be shocked to discover the great Deluge hero Noah was actually a Sumerian King.

In the [Epic of Gilgamesh](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/serpents_dragons/gilgamesh.htm), one of the longest known stories involving the King of a Sumerian city called Uruk, Noah is visited by a King and told of the coming cataclysm, the great flood.

Sadly, the funding for early archaeological inquiries was closely controlled and channeled by early church authorities, in particular [the Roman Catholic Church](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_vatican.htm).

A mandate was issued to fund only the archaeological explorations that perpetuated the story told in the canonical Bible, established by the same institution at the Council of Nicea, 343 CE. Due to the majority who were uneducated in the past, the task of knowing the truth was often delegated to authorities.

Fortunately today knowledge and information distribution is rampant among the internet, and the power is now left in our hands as the efforts of past decoders is finally being disseminated to the world.

&#x200B;

[Is the Biblical story of Noah based on an older account told by the Sumerians? According to the Sumerians, Noah was a Sumerian king who was warned of a coming pole shift which would wipe out most of humanity.](https://preview.redd.it/aldhv49pede41.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e450465177915867e43bc9d1bd7aba41c0e0a5f9)

 

When one realizes that the [*God* from the Old Testament Yahweh](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biblianazar/esp_biblianazar_jehovah.htm), was none other than the local deity of the Sumerian city of Ur, Enlil, the truth is revealed.

Enlil and his various relatives were venerated as gods in various temples from Nineveh to Assur to the Sumerian city of Ur to name just a few. Similarly, his brother Enki and his children Nannar and Innana also had temples in prominent cultural and trade portals within the region.

More importantly, Enlil was not acting alone, but rather in consort with [others referred to as the Anunnaki](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sumer_anunnaki/anunnaki/anu_1.htm).

**Enlil** and his brother, **Enki**, are mentioned in the Genesis and the more historical Clay Tablets as participating in genetic trials to produce a primitive worker, Homo sapiens.

&#x200B;

[The Sumerian records reveal that \\""Adam\\"" and \\""Eve\\"" were not created by \\""God\\"", but rather they were genetically engineered by an advanced race of extra-terrestrials called the Anunnaki.](https://preview.redd.it/85jrz1csede41.jpg?width=351&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=81c30e2f0ad0450b170d67aef7e373f1b7a8736b)

 

A very detailed account is provided of a clinical trial that results in the archetype for the human race, ""Adam,"" being birthed.

The trial was conducted by Enlil's half-sister, Ninmah, and his half-brother Enki, in an African laboratory.

The historical records appeal to even the most scrutinizing scientist who readily recognized the threshold of knowledge required to discuss a topic such as genetic engineering in a document almost 5000 years old which provides a more detailed account of the creation of man, one that makes sense technically and historically versus the précis version provide by the Bible, although in many cases complementary.

This would perhaps explain the age of Noah, who was said to be 600 years old at the time of the great flood. Noah was the son of a ""deity"" according to the Bible. Could this father ""deity"" really be an extra-terrestrial being which gave rise to Noah's lengthy lifespan?  


Various deities in Sumerian and Egyptian records had also known as (AKA) names which seemed to span long periods of time and were found throughout various ancient texts.

For example, the Akkadian god Sin was also known as the moon god Nannar, son of Enlil.

[His sister, Inanna](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sumer_anunnaki/esp_sumer_inanna.htm) also sported the symbol of the crescent moon and had temples throughout Mesopotamia. She was known as Ishtar to the Akkadians.

&#x200B;

[Interestingly, many deities from other cultures such as the Greeks and Egyptians were alternate versions of original Sumerian \\""gods\\"". The Egyptian goddess Ishtar was really the Sumerian deity Inanna, who according to Sumerian text was a high ranking member of the Anunnaki.](https://preview.redd.it/ppnoh3evede41.jpg?width=341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bfcb242037fd7c515d4bc405cba19445e8b2a7d4)

 

The Greek historian **Herodotus** lived in the 5**th** century BCE and hailed from Ionia; he delineated the Egyptian civilization into three dynasties and the model is still used by Egyptologists today.

**Manetho**, the Egyptian priest-historian agrees with the three dynasties, except adds one more dynasty which was ruled by the ""gods"" alone. He states the first dynastic rulers of Egyptian gods ruled for 12.300 years.  **\[1\]**

It is interesting to note that in the Sumerian texts, Enki was assigned the regions of Egypt and Africa by his father Anu, on or before 3760 BCE. It just so happens that the Jewish calendar, whose origins are from the Sumerian city of Nippur, begins its count in 3760 BCE as well.

&#x200B;

[The two royal Anunnaki brothers held animosity for one another, causing ancient wars often referred to as the \\""great wars in heaven\\"" in the Christian dogma.](https://preview.redd.it/ptimfjqyede41.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=697818c97cf3721f268360714d099935984207b9)

  

  
  

The Sumerians claimed that all aspects of civilization were taught to them by the deities that were worshipped in the temples of Mesopotamia.

Detailed knowledge about the Earth's orbital plane, tilt axis, spherical shape, and precession behavior of its equinox were known by the Sumerian deities, who were also credited for the construction of the Zodiac.

Contrast this detailed level of knowledge in Sumer with that possessed in Europe during the Middle-Ages.

Scientists and church authorities in Europe were at odds whether the Earth was round or flat while the people of Sumeria and the surrounding region had advance mathematics, metallurgy, law codes, and produced many civilization first inventions and advanced achievements. 

&#x200B;

[The Anunnaki family tree according to Sumerian records.](https://preview.redd.it/zsxwy6k3fde41.jpg?width=388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce09990fd5f06643fb72529a34a3a6ea4f2e1c2b)

 

 

The correlation between the God of the Old Testament and the Sumerian god are apparent; the Sumerian *storm God*, Enlil, can be considered [*the* *God of wrath and vengeance in the Old Testament*](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biblianazar/esp_biblianazar_jehovah.htm).

When discussing religious truth, there is what the ruling party or superpower believes and what the subordinated cultures believe which is given a derogatory label as pagan or occult.

An example of this is taking place and manifesting presently in the Middle East where religious factions representing Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are waging war in the ancient land of Canaan, near Mount Megiddo located south of Israel. Warring factions whose genealogy originates from Sumer are still in conflict today.

The devotees of *Enlil, AKA Yahweh the God of the Old Testament*, stand toe to toe with the followers of Enki, still at odds with each other of the domination of the Earth.

Could the conflicts involving the countries of Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Israel be a result of the past wars that took place between the ""gods"" Enlil and Enki and their offspring as written about in ""[War of Gods and Men](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/wars_godsmen.pdf)"" by [**Zecharia Sitchin**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sitchin.htm)?  


According to Sumerologists, the term AN.UNNA.KI literally is interpreted as those who from ""heaven to Earth came.""

The key point to note early on is the affiliation of the term ""heaven"" with the claimed planet of Anunnaki origin, namely Nibiru as detailed in ""[The 12th Planet](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sitchin/planeta12/12planeteng_index.htm)"" by Sitchin.

Additionally, from the list of characters detailed as ""deities"" in Mesopotamian literature we know that the head of the Anunnaki council of 12 was chaired by Anu, the father of the two key players and half-brothers Enlil and Enki.

NI.BI.RU is composed from the now digitized cuneiform script, listed in Unicode as 1224C, 12249, and 12292.

Thus, a more accurate interpretation of the word Anunnaki is *'those who from Anu to the Earth came'...* or were sent.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xu1xu0b6fde41.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48a77f3899afb0a134184f1a94ec1990d59ee33d

 

Equating the [planet Nibiru](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_hercolobus.htm) with the word Heaven, as used in the Bible, is an important detail when re-examining prayers like ""Our father who art in Heaven…,"" shining a whole new light on who the *Father in Heaven* actually was, namely Anu (ruler of the Anunnaki and father of Enlil and Enki).

Thus, the prayers must have originated from Anu's extra-terrestrial children on Earth.  


What was the reason the Anunnaki left Nibiru to come to Earth? According to Sitchin and other authors on the subject, Nibiru, located beyond Pluto, is trapped in a 3600 year retrograde elliptical orbit around our Sun.

According to Sumerian maps and reports from 1983 IRAS Naval Observatory by Dr. [**Robert S. Harrington**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_autor_harrington.htm), discovery of a large planet in the region Nibiru was reported to reside near where the Sumerians indicated, beyond Pluto.**\[8\]**

In short, the Anunnaki home planet is real and inbound to perihelion circa 1400 years from now.  


Brown dwarf planets, as we know, do not receive significant solar radiation to keep the surface temperature habitable. The atmosphere on Nibiru was generated either artificially or from gases and released steam from the geothermal heated planet.

According to Sitchin's published history timeline **\[6\]** approximately 450.000 years ago, life on Nibiru was facing extinction due to a deteriorating atmosphere and the subsequent exposure to radiation, especially at close Perihelion with the Sun.

One of the leaders of Nibiru traveled inwards and landed on Earth, discovering [Earth's surplus of gold](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_gold.htm).

Because of their advancements in technology, the Anunnaki could use gold to save the failing atmosphere of Nibiru by dispersing the ionized particles into the planet's atmosphere.

&#x200B;

[\\""Tree of Life\\"", notice the symbol at the top of the tablet, an object which closely resembles the Egyptian sun-disk. This ancient symbol has many theorized meanings, including the Sun and enlightened knowledge held and passed down by the royal lineage for millennia.](https://preview.redd.it/7yy66h89fde41.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6e6eafcbe2111b32573c04f9b75743ca842f3329)

&#x200B;

 

Anu and his two sons Enlil and Enki eventually came to excavate Earth for the gold as well, however, Enlil and Enki kept their distance due to a rivalry.

According to Niburian inheritance rules, Enlil was the rightful heir due to his position as son of Anu and Anu's Sister. Enki was only son of Anu, his mother wasn't of royal blood.

The female contribution to genetic material includes mitochondrial DNA which the male does not. Enki was assigned mining operation in Africa, Enlil in Mesopotamia, and a granddaughter named Inanna was given the Indus Valley region.

The division took place and was finalized in 3760 BCE.  


To increase efficiency, the higher ranking members of the Anunnaki brought several subservient workers to help with gold mining labour (known as [Watchers or Igigi](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_watchers.htm)). The Igigi worked hard for some time, but inevitably grew tiresome of their slave conditions and revolted against the Anunnaki.

This forced the Anunnaki to establish a new plan, one that developed a hybrid being, a primitive worker, to replace the Igigi gold diggers: the Homo-sapiens.

&#x200B;

 

**The Formation of Our Solar System According to Sumerian Text**  
The following is a summary of the formation of our solar system according to the Sumerian epoch, [Enuma Elish](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sumer_anunnaki/esp_sumer_annunaki01.htm). According to the text, told in an allegory of celestial warriors, ten planets composed our solar system.

Earth was not yet formed, as it was then part of a larger planet called Tiamut, which eventually crashed into Nibiru during the initial formation of the planet's orbits, leaving behind an immense trail of debris from which the Earth formed, along with the asteroid belt. During this cataclysm the mass of the forming Earth also captured Nibiru's moon.

It is theorized that this initial disaster transferred the original seeds of life to Earth, a form of *accidental* [*Panspermia*](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_ciencia_life.htm#Panspermia).  


The significance of the Sumerian's Epic of Creation specifies one additional planet in our solar system, the Anunnaki's home planet Nibiru, who's aphelion is positioned beyond Pluto in a 3600 year retrograde orbit around the Sun.

Dr. Robert S. Harrington, chief of the U.S. Naval Observatory used an infra-red satellite, IRAS, to locate a large planetary body which was causing wobbles in the orbital paths of Uranus and Neptune.

The IRAS produced results indicating a large brown dwarf, four times larger than the size of Earth, had been located without question.

Harrington and Van Flandern of the Naval Observatory, published their findings and opinion that a tenth planet had been located in our solar system, even calling it an intruder planet. **\[3\]**

Harrington met with Sitchin to correlate the IRAS findings with the Babylonian Epic of Creation, the Enuma Elish.

Given the evidence reported by IRAS, other space probes like Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager, and the corroborating orbital path, planet size, and retrograde characteristics of the tenth planet, Harrington agreed with Sitchin that it was Nibiru. **\[3\]**  


As so, the passage of a tenth planet the magnitude of Nibiru between Mars and Jupiter would certainly have a noticeable impact every 3600 years.

With this in mind, it is highly probable that Nibiru's passage may be responsible for pole shifts and reversals, [changes in the Earth](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_earthchanges.htm)'s precession about its axis, and potentially dangerous meteors and space debris drug along from the asteroid belt inbound to Perihelion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Could Nibiru's Perihelion 3600 year orbit be the cause of the great cataclysms discussed in ancient texts?](https://preview.redd.it/d6xg490gfde41.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f71f668714153d1904c0a1127bdd442d8d74697e)

[What were the Egyptians depicting in their hieroglyphics at Abydos? Could they be telling the tale of alien \\""gods\\"" descending from the skies in UFOs?](https://preview.redd.it/crc99plhfde41.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=806578ec1c28c5dab8ede209dc04dbebc05d1fcf)

 

Unusual artifacts found around the world, those that seem to contradict the know abilities of the civilization under analysis, are not hard to find.

Examples include hieroglyphs from [the Egyptian temple of Abydos](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/egipto/esp_abydos.htm), *depicting rockets, airplanes, submarines, and even an advanced helicopter*. There is also an Iraqi battery find, precision stone masonry and architecture using megalithic stones.

Of all the material accessible to a culture, why use the most difficult material as possible? Massive 1000 ton blocks.  


Findings from around the world to include model airplanes, incredibly sophisticated solar and lunar temples aligned to solstice and equinox alike, along with tens of thousands of advanced beings teaching civilizing technologies to indigenous peoples points overwhelmingly to the fact that the Anunnaki were here on Earth.  


Sitchin was instrumental in getting the Sumerian details about the Anunnaki records for the world to see. It has taken over 100 years for the information to be accepted thus far. Tablets are now digitized for translation speed and accuracy. **\[4\]**  


An important point to mention is that the Sumerian flood account was clearly copied and modified to create the Genesis account, written by Hebrew priests being held captive in Babylon, where they had access to the true story of the great flood but chose to placate Enlil as their chosen monotheistic ancient astronaut god. After all, they were scared to death of Enlil's wrath.

Genesis 6 describes the background scene to the great flood, leaving out all references to the other members of the Anunnaki council in the Torah narrative.

According to Sumerian records, the wrathful ""God"" in the Christian Epic ""Genesis"" was in fact an Anunnaki king named Enlil, who was weary of the his brother Enki's genetic creation of mankind.

Enlil worried that humanity would grow and eventually revolt against him, and so, Enlil ordered the destruction of mankind by disease and natural disasters.

>Genesis 6:1-8 (NIV)  
When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.  
   
Then the Lord said,  
""My Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.""  
[The Nephilim](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/alien_watchers.htm) were on the earth in those days - and also afterward - when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.  
The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.  
   
So the *Lord* said,  
""I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created - and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground - for I regret that I have made them.""  
But Noah found favour in the eyes of the Lord.

Enlil (*God* in the Hebrew Genesis) did not create man, but rather, his half-brother Enki and their sister Ninmah were more so involved in the genetic manipulation, as evidenced in [the Atrahasis](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/serpents_dragons/boulay03e_a.htm), predating the Genesis account by 1700 years.

Enlil apparently wiped out man because of their incessant noise, although this motive seems bleak, and considering the animosity between Enlil and Enki, one must only consider that Enlil's motive behind wiping out mankind had something to do with the fact that Homo sapiens were seeds of Enki and thus had the potential to rise up against Enlil.

Enlil was a ghost writer of the Bible, and consequently the truth was distorted to benefit the latter.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, the ""plant of knowledge of good and evil"", the ""forbidden fruit"", was present in Enki's first outpost city of Eridu.

Enlil (AKA Jehovah/God) tells [Adapa](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sitchin/legend_adapa.htm) (Adam) in Eridu's Garden of Eden that if he eats the fruit he will die.

Enki counteracts this lie and tells Adapa he will surely not die but instead become ""like one of us, the gods"". Thus, there seems to be a transformational effect produced by this plant that changes human consciousness.

In any event, Enki tells the truth and is demonized and symbolized as a snake, while Enlil lies, and promotes himself as *God*.

This lie, the fact that Adam did not die but rather became aware of his nakedness, attests to not want the plant of the knowledge of good and evil consumed. It was about controlling the access to higher consciousness, frowned upon by Enlil.  


Mankind was Enki's proud creation with the help of his relative Ninharsag, which successfully alleviated the Anunnaki's toils of gold mines just as he promised. Enlil said he was tired of man's noise, and wanted Enki to release some form of disease to wipe them out.

Of course, Enki defied his brother and offered guidance and protection of man. Enlil continued to order the death of the Homo sapiens, and afflicted man with sickness, headaches, and other disease. **\[7\]**  


To finalize the death of man, Enlil orders Enki to conjure up a great flood. Enki refuses, and the tension continues to build between the two brothers.

Although the Anunnaki had the technological means to manipulate the weather, it is unclear whether the great flood to come was caused by the Anunnaki themselves or by the gravitational forces wrought by Nibiru's passing of Earth, enroute to a 3600 year solar perihelion.

Regardless of the cause, Enlil took credit to establish his perceived power to punish. Hence the correlation to the Old Testament's God of Wrath and Enlil's genocidal attributes.

[Before the pole shift, Enki warned one of his sons, Atrahasis, about the coming disaster, helping him create a boat atop a mountain. The Biblical tale of Noah was taken from the Sumerian record.](https://preview.redd.it/lkzlshgrfde41.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e52ce7159b53fdb06e6fef07d303c37d9bf18d0d)

 

Enki decided to modify an oath made to withhold knowledge of the impending watery disaster from the people, and instructs his son Atrahasis to build a boat.

Enki helps Atrahasis relocate the boat to Mr. Ararat. Also important to note, the idea that Noah housed a number of animal species on the boat is a misconception. It was animal DNA that was collected and saved. **\[7\]**  


Thus, Atrahasis is the biblical Noah. Also noted, Ninharsag is later to be called ""Isis"" in ancient Egypt.

According [to Sumerian records](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sumer_annunaki.htm), one of Enki's sons, [Thoth](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_thot.htm), was the creator of and key proponent of mankind becoming the ""Sons of God"" through the awakening of the energy bodies (chakras) and subsequent consciousness, which he designed to be sensitive to the various frequencies affiliated with the radial distance and frequencies caused by a spherical resonator, i.e., the Earth.

One can read [the Emerald Tablets](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/thot/esp_thot_1.htm) to get a sense of the advanced energy knowledge Thoth possessed.

Also, as evidenced by his staff, *the Caduceus*, he was an adept geneticist. [**Lawrence Gardner**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_autor_gardner.htm) in his pre-eminent [*Genesis of the Grail Kings*](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biblianazar/esp_biblianazar_21.htm), discusses the meaning of the ancient symbol associated with Thoth.

Knowledge of energy, matter, and [the human pineal gland](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_pinealgland.htm) were at play as a function of human consciousness connected to DNA.

Enki designed primitive workers with highly scientific abilities:

>genetic functional mappings with a human energy body composed of 7 chakras.

The chakras provide access to an evolutionary means that allow mankind to continue on its path of conscious expansion.

These seven quantized energy states were intentionally designed by Enki providing mankind an interface for future evolution of consciousness. Enki did not seem comfortable accepting the concept of slavery versus creating a primitive worker that just got a genetic jumpstart with the potential of becoming one of the gods.

To the Anunnaki, the [mechanism of evolution of consciousness](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_ascension.htm) was highly classified.  
 

**Could The Sumerian Narrative Be The Answer?**  
Extensive, detailed, and controversial, the [Sumerian Creation Epic](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sumer_anunnaki/esp_sumer_annunaki01.htm) stands as both an opponent and an adversary to theories of modern science as well as today's most prominent religious doctrines, a subject of volatile discourse.

These ancient writings help to broaden our knowledge of the origin of mankind while challenging the well-established account told from the Bible.

The *Ancient Astronaut Theory* may test the beliefs of the majority, as depictions and dramatizations of extra-terrestrial beings in mainstream culture have stifled people's understanding of the latter, yet one cannot deny the enigma that surrounds the innovations and knowledge that the Sumerians possessed.

Moreover, evolution's biggest puzzle has yet to be completed - the *miraculous* leap from Homo-erectus to Homo-sapiens.

However, the Sumerians offer detailed scientific clarification on this matter.  


The fact that numerous indigenous cultures world-wide built monuments which looked to worship the sky, and shared similar stories of ""gods"" ascending from the ""heavens"" should beg the question of an extra-terrestrial presence during those times.

There is an uncanny correlation between the stories and knowledge-base of the ancient cultures and the timeline in which they acquired a deeper understanding of astrology, technology, biology, and spirituality, subjects which only gained proper comprehension in the last few centuries. The Sumerian records stand as one of mankind's most important collections of history to date.

37,The Zodiac Killer was likely “The Monster of Florence”,27.0,x4w10p,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/x4w10p/the_zodiac_killer_was_likely_the_monster_of/,7.0,1662216079.0,"“In 2017, Francesco Amicone, a freelance journalist, conducted an investigation on his own that would lead him to find a connection between the Monster of Florence and the Zodiac Killer cases. Amicone's inquiry has been published in Italian magazine Tempi and newspapers Il Giornale and Libero.

The suspect is a former superintendent of the Florence American Cemetery in Italy, Joseph aka GIuseppe Bevilacqua, also known as Giuseppe, who was born on 20 December 1935, in Totowa, New Jersey, and had a 20-years career in the Army when he left it to move to Florence in 1974.

Amicone wrote an account of a Bevilacqua's partial admission, in which he would have confessed to Amicone being responsible of the murders attributed to the Zodiac killer and the Monster of Florence in an unregistered conversation occurred on 11 September 2017. After the first publication in May 2018, Bevilacqua denied this; even though threatened with a lawsuit, Amicone did not stop accusing him. In 2021, Amicone claimed that Bevilacqua would have been an undercover CID agent assigned to an investigation in San Francisco concerning SMA William O. Wooldridge and other Army sergeants at the time of Zodiac's homicides in 1969 and 1970. Whilst an Army criminal investigator in Italy in the early 1970s, Amicone says that Bevilacqua would have had access to a case file of a double murder near Florence in 1968 where bullets and shell casings had been improperly stored, and that Bevilacqua replaced the pieces of evidence with spent cartridges shot by the gun he would use in the Monster's homicides in order to link his future crimes to those murders for which he had an alibi. Italian authorities collected Bevilacqua's DNA in late 2020, but gave no further updates since.”

I had the realization, that being born in a certain zodiac(time), is like the split equivalent of being born in a certain country (space) on this earth. For example everyone was born at a specific time and location. The time is your zodiac, and the space is your country.

If you’re thinking, ""well this is obvious"", or ""I don’t believe in zodiac signs!"" Just hear me out, I’m only using the zodiac as a measurement of time and space on a solar level. Because if you look closely, our entire solar system is one giant clock. The planets move around the sun in a circular motion which literally pinpoint the time of year on each planet, while simultaneously pinpointing the time of day on each planet. Not only that but the stars in our galaxy are also rotating but on a RIDICULOUSLY larger scale. Both the time of day, and time of year are human constructs that can only exist when measured.

Imagine if you were born on 7/22/18 in The united states. This would make you a cancer, but If you were born in Australia at the exact same same time you would be leo. By changing just the space and location, this in result changed the “time” you were born.

In contrast say you were born on this planet one billion years ago, In the exact same spot on the earth. By changing the ""time"" you were born you would live on an unrecognizable planet, with a different space and location in relation to the earth, solar system, and galaxy you know today.

How does this tie into conspiracy? Well i must explain that everything is physical. This includes sound, thoughts, and light. Both sound and light are both made of the same atoms used to create this reality...but at a lower vibrational frequency, which is why sound and light don’t appear physical. Sound particles must enter your ear drum for you to hear, and light particles must hit your eyes for you too see, but both sound and light must come from a physical source.

By measuring time with an illusory concept, based on words and numbers, instead of whats right in front of you, you literally separate time from space....neither can exist without the other.

.



Immortality, ascension before death, the power to heal, reincarnation, or just spiritual attainment requires full knowledge of the source of life (knowing God). This knowledge has been tightly guarded and used for power and profit for centuries by religions and mystery cults. They milk profit and power while making it unattainable for most all, justified by the notion that THEY must decide and control who is worthy. They have obscured this knowledge in a veil of myths, dogma, and superstition.  Rearrange the letters of the word ""veil"".

According  to modern science.... The human body has an outer capacitance of about 100pf. The inner body works mostly by ionic means. An ion is an atom or molecule that has a net electrical charge. The body's electrical circuitry works by ion channels and voltage controlled ion gates. Your thought is actually electrical impulses by neurons. 

The energy that is the source of all life is a form of electrical energy that is transferred through this planet by complex planetary interaction induction and thus time specific (pulsed), which is the reason for holy days. We literally live all of our lives inside of electrical fields that we call the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. The form of electrical energy that creates life can be focused and accumulated by wave guide resonators and/or multi-layered capacitors. These things have historically been called pyramids, temples, cathedrals, tabernacles, arks, alters, holy of holies, bridal chambers. 

The human body is out of tune/alignment or from another perspective earthly matter bound to your life force or from another perspective the electro-chemical actions of a battery running low. All things we eat are dead and thus add to this, some more than others. Our emotional state (E motion) adds to or subtracts from this. This is the reason for illness and death. 

Why was food altered on the alter before eaten all throughout written history? What is eaten, drunk, or applied to the body after being charged/altered inside of the tabernacle/ark/alter/holy of holies? Why is this considered to literally be God that is eaten? Think with reason, not with dogma. God = source of life. Why did Jesus say  “One who does not eat my flesh and drink my blood does not have life within.” ?  

An ion with a net charge has a measurable polarity. This polarity is either positive/male/Adam or negative/female/Eve and has it's gender exposed to be seen and thus is considered naked. When two ions of similar but opposite charge are brought together they, by the laws of attraction, bind to each other and together have a net charge of zero and are considered bound/married/wed or in other words it's gender is covered. This is the allegory of Adam and Eve that explains the original sin. Today we use the word ""sine"" wave for a wave that changes polarity. 

If you wanted to make the crown of thorns that Jesus wore where would you get it? The genus of trees that have thorns contains the tree that produces the resin called Frankincense. This resin was historically recovered by brutally flaying and stabbing the bark of the tree. Then the tree seems to bleed out of it's wounds the resin that then hardens. Resin is the most positive natural substance on the triboelectric scale and is also used in the alchemical process of making the sacrament. Some of the preparation process may require the substance to be crucified in a crucible where chemicals are changed by crossing a threshold of the chemical bonds using heat or PH value. 

Do you think those that go to church actually get the real thing or just a symbolic substitute? How is the real thing handled verses the normal church proceeding? 

Can hot exist without cold? Good without evil, positive without negative, up without down? This is the nature of our universe. The division of the 2 and the intelligence of the gradient between the 2. These 3 make up the whole, the Trinity. Because every whole contains a division thus the whole truth can seem mirrored and be confusing without this understanding. 

All religions, myths, and cults contain this same knowledge veiled in allegory. Universal forces, planets, zodiac periods, and the cycles of these are many times anthropomorphized and given names and backstories as gods.  This is to veil in allegory the timing of the planetary interactions that the energy of life is transferred to this planet. 

Many contain stories of immortals who were once human but learned the great knowledge and then used it to rule over the human world. These are also portrayed as gods. These immortals are portrayed to only have this power because of the special food they eat, whether it be golden apples, peaches of immortality, exc.. The myths say after these immortals caused the great flood, or some portray it as being caused by the god of a very long natural cycle, they decided to withdraw from interacting with the human world but still rule over it through the human kings they put in place. They are sometimes called the watchers. Who is said to be speaking through the many things historically called an oracle that is in the holy of holies of every true temple or cathedral? Is it truly god or just one of these human immortals on an advanced radio? Why are the kings throughout history always anointed with the sacramental oil and said to be ordained by god? 

In this age of information is the truth not attainable by he who googles? Are not even the oldest texts written by humans translated to english and available to read on the internet.

Pre-word on astrology.
The old gods never disappeared, they are hidden in plain sight. Take for example the days of the week are the seven traditional planets. They also apply to human psyche of the human subconscious mind. When your angry your invoking an aspect of Mars, when you feel love your invoking an aspect of Venus. Its always the same characters played out in every mythical story or interactions, or your state of mind. The difference is where the planets are placed in someone's birth chart that makes the characteristics of who they are.

So have we moved into the Age of Aquarius?

Aquarius the water-carrier is an air sign in the fixed mode. Aquarius is a sign of high ideals, futuristic vision, sudden genius, and insight.
George Floyd said ""I cant Breathe!"" 

The water that Aquarius carries is divine wisdom and light to be shared freely with every person no matter their status. Aquarius is a deeply humanitarian sign, seeing God in the heart of every person and yearning for a true universal community of humankind.

Aquarius is the 11th zodiacal sign, just before Pisces which is the very last sign where everything that has been created dissolves back into the Absolute. ""The Great Reset"" Therefore in Aquarius almost all the processes of life represented throughout the zodiac have been fulfilled, and this sign feels the urgency for a REVOLUTION to create a better world ""Build Back Better"" where equality and liberty reign. (Perhaps The Collapse of the financial system we know?) (World Economic Forum Founder & Excecutive - Klaus Schwab - ""You will own nothing and be happy!"" By 2030 LOL).

Aquarius is ruled by the planets Saturn and Uranus. Saturn is related with death and time, great forces that everyone must confront and deal with. (Saturn is also the Black Cube, Your mind, Think outside the box), Uranus is closely related with the Greek Titan Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods to give to humanity. Lucifer is somewhat loosely  connected with Prometheus as he is also a light bearer/bringer but with the knowledge he brings, he also brings destruction.

The revolutionary nature of the planet Uranus is seen in its horizontal orbit, completely different from any other planet in the solar system. The energy of Uranus is of abrupt change that can tear down old and entrenched modes of thinking and structures to make room for something completely new. Uranus rules the sexual glands and hormones, the source of powerful impulses within our bodies that can regenerate our system when used wisely. Uranus's partner is Earth ""Gaia"" and he is coming back for her.

Guided by these two planets, Aquarius works toward revolutionary ideas and movements to eliminate outdated systems that cause inequality and oppression, and emphasizes self-reliance and rejection of authority.

Further Age of Aquarius and Revolutionary Teachings.

Aquarius is the water bearer, giving wisdom to suffering humanity. There is no hierarchy, every person has their own internal God and the inner guru to guide them. This is a teaching of individuality, everyone realizes their own particular Being.

Marcia Moore and Mark Douglas promoted the view that, although no one knows when the Aquarian Age begins, the American Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the discovery of electricity are all attributable to the Aquarian Age.

Moore and Douglas make a number of predictions about the trends that they believe will develop in the Aquarian Age.
A common position expressed by many astrologers sees the Age of Aquarius as that time when humanity takes control of the Earth and its own destiny as its rightful heritage, with the destiny of humanity being the revelation of truth and the expansion of consciousness, and that some people will experience mental enlightenment in advance of others and therefore be recognized as the new leaders in the world.

Proponents of medieval astrology suggest that the Pisces world where religion is the opiate of the masses will be replaced in the Aquarian Age by a world ruled by secretive, power-hungry elites seeking absolute power over others; that knowledge in the Aquarian Age will only be valued for its ability to win wars; that knowledge and science will be abused, not industry and trade; and that the Aquarian Age will be a Dark Age in which religion is considered offensive.

Another view suggests that the rise of scientific rationalism, combined with the fall of religious influence, the increasing focus on human rights since the 1780s, the exponential growth of technology, plus the advent of flight and space travel, are evidence of the dawning of the Age of Aquarius.

A ""wave"" theory of the shifting Great Ages suggests that the Age of Aquarius will not arrive on a given date but is instead emerging in influence over many years, similar to how the tide surges forward incrementally rather than all at once.

In an article about feminism in the French newspaper La Fronde from February 26, 1890, August Vandekerkhove stated: ""About March, 21st this year the cycle of Aquarius will start. Aquarius is the house of the woman"". He adds that is in this age the woman will be equal to the man.",conspiracy,Zodiac

However, it certainly was a remarkable one.

[Here's the original thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/?sort=top) and [here's the book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Most-Dangerous-Book-World/dp/1937584178/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1355502572&sr=8-1&keywords=the+most+dangerous+book+in+the+world) that I used as a source for this information.

Granted, the book's author was off with respect to location (he was predicting Phoenix), but the fact that the event happened *11* days before Christmas 2012 is certainly interesting in light of the following.

Here's the summary that I wrote (disclaimer: I don't *believe* this, I just find it interesting):

9/11 was *so* effective that it incapacitated the majority of the world's population. The event was so diabolical, so *grand*, that it brought about an alchemical transmutation in the minds of the populace. 

The events that day polarized the world more than any before: some people were thrust further into the blindness of their ""matrix"", and others were catapulted directly out of it, being forced into Chapel Perilous.

So, why are the 4 flight numbers on 9/11 so important? 

11...175...77...93...

...and what do they have to do with ""the wickedest man in the world"", [Aleister Crowley?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley)

The Twin Towers, the Twin Pillars of Hercules, the Gemini of astrology, Jachin and Boaz of Freemasonry (with the ""Salomon's"" Temple Building 7 accompanying them)...were they constructed with the foreknowledge that they would be brought down in a fiery sacrificial cataclysm?

So what does this have to do with the infamous Aleister Crowley? And what does the number 11 have do with all of this?

In Crowley's own words: the number 11 is ""the number of Magick in itself [and] therefore suitable to all types of operation. [It is] the sacred number par excellence of the new Aeon [the Aeon of Horus, Crowley's name for the new age, with himself as the prophet, of course.]""

What better way to start a Mega-Ritual on the 11th day of September (111 days before the end of the year) than to have Flight 11 crash into the tower on the 93rd floor (the significance of that number will become apparent, if it isn't already).

And the second plane? Flight 175 would soon smash into the *77th* floor of the other tower. We'll get to the 77, but for now what's the significance of 175?

Since we're in the realm of Crowley, let's see what he had to say about 175.

""There are three main methods of invoking any Deity...The 'First Method' consists of devotion to that Deity...a perfect instruction exists in Liber 175. This is the book of uniting to a particular Deity by devotion.""

[Here's the Wikipedia page for the Libri of Crowley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libri_of_Aleister_Crowley). Note that 175 says ""On uniting oneself to a Deity.""

Before you start to think this is getting way too esoteric, I'll give you three guesses as to which Deity was being invoked (and the first two don't count).

Again in Crowley's own words: ""I was not content to believe in a personal devil and serve him, in the ordinary sense of the word. I wanted to get hold of him personally and become his chief of staff.""

So, is there an unusual event that might give us an idea which Deity was invoked when 175 supposedly hit the tower?

If you recall what the Commander in Thief at the time was doing, well then it should become painfully obvious.

The moment the 2nd plane hit the tower George W. Bush was reading [""The Pet Goat""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Pet_Goat) in Sarasota, Florida, strangely enough just 10 miles away from Venice, the location of the flight school Mohamed Atta and another ""hijacker"" trained at. What a coincidence!

This ""reading"" of The Pet Goat was essentially a ""Black Mass"", a ""satirical ceremony, a Commander-in-Chief that wouldn't leave his seat until the reading of a story about a pet goat was completed (""I read this book that I may study the nature of my Deity,"") during which time hundreds of his fellow Americans were in harm's way, many of them meeting horrific ends as they burned alive or plunged to their deaths from the towers (""Yet also may he deliberately practise cruelties"")--conjuring the image of [The Tower tarot card](http://www.rootwerx.com/tarotdecks/bosch/the-tower/images/Rider-Waite_The_Tower_large.jpg)--all taking place in...""Paradise,"" the city of Sarasota's unofficial yet widely-used nickname. Well How about that?""

For those who still are unsure what Deity was being invoked, [here's an image that may give you a hint](http://kkoagulaa.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/baphomet.jpg).

If you *still* think all of this is a stretch, hang on, it gets better (or worse, depending on how you look at it)!

AA77 was supposedly piloted by an individual who, according to one of his instructors, ""could not fly at all."" And yet he was able to pull off an *incredible* stunt, and instead of attacking several more strategic points in the Pentagon, he just so happened to choose the very wing were the DoD's accounting division was located...and conveniently enough Donald Rumsfeld had announced the *day before* the attacks they they couldn't account for $2.3 *trillion* in transactions. The records of this and interest in this announcement all but disappeared after the attacks.

Is there significance to the number 77? You bet your occult-deciphering ass there is. 

[A∴A∴](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4) is a magical order that was created by Crowley in 1907. [Here's their seal](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/A.%27.a.%27._seal.png).

AA77 anyone??

From The Book of Lies: ""7, the septenary; 11, the magical number; 77, the manifestation, therefore, of the septenary. Through matter, because 77 is written in Hebrew Ayin Zayin (OZ), and He-Goat, the symbol of matter, Capricornus, the Devil of the Tarot; which is the picture of the Goat of the Sabbath upon an altar.

Black Mass anyone?

Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, lists 77 ""infernal names"" of the ""Gods and Goddesses of the Royal Palace of Hell.""

It gets better: the Pentagon, which is 77 feet tall, is located on the [*77th meridian west!*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77th_meridian_west). Oh and George H.W. Bush, who first announced his plans for a ""New World Order"" on September 11th, 1990 (11 years before...well shit this is just getting too obvious), well daddy Bush was...77 at the time of the attacks.

For the record, I'm not demonizing *any* of these numbers. Symbols can be used for good *or* evil, I don't believe a number can be inherently ""evil."" After all, ""Symbols don't kill people; people with symbols kill people.""

Any more 77's we can add to this already overbearing occult script? You bet.

I'm sure most of you are familiar with the ""mystery plane"" that was spotting in New York and above the Pentagon during the attacks. The plane has [since been identified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4#September_11.2C_2001) as the E-4B, a highly secretive and advanced plane also referred to as the ""Doomsday Plane"".

A FOIA request *finally* got more information from the FAA in 2008 about this extremely unusual plane that should *not* have been there (unless it piloting the attack aircraft by remote control, but that opens a whole new can of worms. The call sign of this plane that was spotted above the Pentagon during the attack? VENUS77!

For those that are astrologically-minded, the conjunctions of the planet Venus against the Zodiac [form a pentagram!](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m4vuo4c01W4/ULUX7nPQdBI/AAAAAAAAA74/7kuCnP21xYk/s1600/Example_Venus_pentagram.jpg)...Venus invokes the pentagram (plenty of information available on this with a simple online search).

So Flight 77 eliminates Rummy's dirty laundry (along with anyone else who knew too much) by hitting the 77-foot tall Pentagon (with 7 floors!), on the 77th meridian west, while the Doomsday Plane, call sign Venus77 (Pentagram 77!) circles above. Oh, and flight 175, the plane that evoked the ""Deity"", hit the 77th floor.

And what about that final number? Flight 11 hit floor 93...the final fateful flight that day was...drumroll...flight 93!

For those who are familiar with Crowley, this 4th flight is by far the *easiest* to associate with the diabolical individual.

In fact, there's an entire [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/93_%28Thelema%29) on the importance of the number 93 to Crowley and his religious philosophy Thelema. In fact, Thelemites ofter greet each other with ""93"" or will sign correspondences with ""93/93"" at the end. Flight 93...flight AA11 crashes into the 93rd floor...is this starting to make more or less sense?

There is a great deal of information out their on Building 7 as well, including it essentially being an occult-Masonic construct (Salomon building anyone?). It's 47 stories and trapezoidal shape can attest to that (the 47th Problem of Euclid, also known as the Pythagorean Theorem, ""represents a perfect symbol of Freemasonry"").

There is of course a *whole* new can of worms to open with respect to the *astrological* importance of the 9/11 Mega-Ritual, but there is far too much information on this topic to delve into here, as this is already becoming long-winded.

However, more information can be found in this [well-made series of Youtube videos.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkwBjLG1ULA&feature=player_embedded#!) In a nutshell, Saturn and Pluto achieved a position of powerful opposition on September 11th, 2001 (they are both considered to be ""Lords of Death). Any astrologer can tell you that this alignment does *not* bode well for the people on Earth.

Whether or not you believe in astrology is irrelevant...what *is* relevant is that TPTB *do* believe in this stuff and they flaunt it in our faces because they *can*.

For those of you who *have* been studying these occult scripts, it should come as no surprise that Sirius would get dragged into this mess as well. 

From ""The Most Dangerous Book"": ""Today's Coptic calendar (also called the Alexandrian calendar) is based on the ancient Egyptian calendar and is still used in Egypt, and also by the Coptic Orthodox Church. The first month of the year is named Thout, after Thoth, and thus the first day of the New Year is the 1st of Thout. On the Gregorian calendar, this date coincides with September 11th--so that date is not only New Year's Day, but, more importantly, it is the symbolic, or observed, date of Sirius' heliacal rising.""

Of course, the precession of the equinoxes has shifted this a bit, and today that date has shifted 45 days...now the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs on August 5th.

You'll never guess which date *both* the Statue of Liberty (really an homage to both Isis and Lucifer) and the Twin Towers were ""initiated""...August 5th! (Oh, and the Pentagon was initiated in a Masonic ceremony on September *11th* 1941.)

The occult importance of Sirius is beyond the scope of this post, but just trust me that it's important! Did TPTB do anything to associated the event with the word ""Sirius?"" You betcha.

Do a search for 9/11 and Sirius and you'll find that the only K-9 (K=11...11-9...9-11...maybe I need to slow down a bit) who died on that fateful day was named.......SIRIUS. Sirius was dog number 17...17 is The Star in the Tarot...which according to occultists depicts the star of SIRIUS. cough.

If you think it's overkill that they would name and sacrifice a dog merely to add another layer to their occult script, well then you still don't really get how these events work. The *more* symbolism they cram into the rituals, the more powerful the ritual becomes.

For more information on the occult significance of the numbers and astrology behind the events of 9/11, I recommend [this article](http://intothefaerywoods.blogspot.com/2011/09/aleister-crowley-core-layer-of-matrix.html) and [this interview](http://vftb.net/?p=3984) with the other of another book on this topic (which I haven't read) ""Prophet of Evil: Aleister Crowley, 9/11 and the New World Order"".

50,Reptilians,21.0,5l8cay,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5l8cay/reptilians/,13.0,1483164493.0,"Just came across this in my FB and wanted to share.

The Reptilian Aliens and the Council of the 13 ‘Royal’ Families
The leader of the Earth’s Illuminati is called the “Pindar”. The Pindar is a member of one of the 13 ruling Illuminati families, and is always male. The title, Pindar, is an abbreviated term for “Pinnacle of the Draco”, also known as the “Penis of the Dragon”.
Symbolically, this represents the top of power, control, creation, penetration, expansion, invasion, and fear. The holder of this rank reports to the purebred Reptilian leader in the inner Earth.
Recently, there are reports that the Marquis de Libeaux is the Pindar, but this is disinformation. The true current Pindar is the head of the Rothschild family, as has been for several hundred years.
He is based in Germany near Frankfurt. In the late 1970s, he oversaw the sister project to Montauk, called M.A.L.D.A. is an anagram for Montauk-Alsace-Lorraine Dimensional Activation. This project was located near the city of Strasbourg, France, historically once part of Germany.
Interestingly, there is a winery on the east end of Long Island, not far from Montauk Point, called Pindar Vineyards. This wine is growing in popularity, gaining international accolades.
This fits nicely into the plan, as this area will be a part of the capital district of the Earth/United Nations in the Empire State! Red wine is symbolic of the blood ingested by the Reptilians. The wine can become sanctified as it did in the Roman Catholic Church, a patsy for the Reptilians. In the Catholic Church, wine replaced the blood in ceremony.
The Illuminati here on Earth have established a pyramid structure of control identical to the system that exists in the Draco Empire. The pyramid with the Reptilian eye, located on the American one-dollar bill, is symbolic of this control structure.
The eye is the cap on the pyramid, thus explaining why the original surface of the Great Pyramid in Egypt was capped in solid gold.
The Pindar is represented by the gold cap on the pyramid. The next layer, or “eye”, on the pyramid represents the 13 ruling families. They are as follows:
The Pindar is represented by the gold cap on the pyramid. The next layer, or “eye”, on the pyramid represents the 13 ruling families. They are as follows:
Rothschild (Bauer or Bower) – Pindar
Bruce
Cavendish (Kennedy)
De Medici
Hanover
Hapsburg
Krupp
Plantagenet
Rockefeller
Romanov
Sinclair (St. Clair)
Warburg (del Banco)
Windsor (Saxe-Coburg-Gothe)
Each of the 13 ruling families is given an area of the Earth and/or a particular function to fulfill on the Earth. These particular functions include global finances, military technology / development, mind-control, religion, and media.
Each of the 13 ruling families has a Council of 13 as well. The number, 13, has great significance to them. They know that there are 12 types of energies that pass through the 10 aspects of God-Mind. The totality of the 12 energies equals a 13th energy. This is considered the most powerful knowledge.
They also know that there are really 13 Zodiac signs, not the commonly acknowledged 12. They have kept the 13th hidden for centuries because it is the sign of the Dragon. They keep the qualities and traits of this sign secret to avoid giving away clues to the Reptilian mind-pattern.
The next layer is the second-in-command families who do the support work for the Pindar and 13 ruling families. While all of the 13 ruling family members are shape-shifters, all members of the 300 supporting families are not. They do, however, all have a high percentage of Reptilian DNA.
[Alexander: In my opinion, if the so called shape-shifting actually exists, then it’s nothing more than advanced technology put at work, and we cannot yet understand it. Alternatively, it may be a misunderstood type of possession — for a better reference, you can imagine the reptilian extraterrestrials using human bodies as vehicles, similar to the way humans used the Na’vi in the Avatar movie].
They are known as the “Committee of 300“.These families include such notable names as Agnelli, Balliol, Beale, Bell, Bouvier, Bush, Cameron, Campbell, Carnegie, Carrington, Coolidge, Delano, Douglas, Ford, Gardner, Graham, Hamilton, Harriman, Heinz, Kuhn, Lindsay, Loeb, Mellon, Montgomery, Morgan, Norman, Oppenheimer, Rhodes, Roosevelt, Russell, Savoy, Schiff, Seton, Spencer, Stewart/Stuart, Taft, and Wilson. There are many others.
The Committee of 300 use many well-known institutions to accomplish their goals, including the Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderburgers, Trilateral Commission, Club of Rome, Royal Institute for International Affairs, Mafia, CIA, NSA, Mossad, Secret Service (SS), International Monetary Fund, Federal Reserve, Internal Revenue Service, and Interpol, to name a few. All of these are private organizations or corporations set up as public service devices, but this is far from the truth.
The Illuminati structure also creates artificial countries to further their goals. Examples of these are the United States, Switzerland, Kuwait, the Soviet Union, Panama, Israel, Italy, Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom, most of Black Africa, all of the Arab countries, and all of Central and South America.
These nations were created to amass wealth for the ruling families and their supporters, to hide or keep their wealth, and to create unstable conditions necessary to start wars or increase military budgets.
Switzerland was created as a neutral banking centre so that Illuminati families would have a safe place to keep their funds without fear of destruction from wars and prying eyes.
The United States was established with 13 colonies, one for each of the Illuminati families. The original flag had 13 stars, and still has 13 stripes. The eagle, the symbol of the United States, holds 13 arrows in its talons.
The United States is actually a corporate asset of the Virginia Company that was established in 1604 in England with direct involvement of the Rothschilds. The finances of the Rothschilds were necessary to fund the exploration and exploitation of the North American continent.
The assets of the Virginia Company, including the United States, are owned by the Holy Roman Empire via the Vatican. This occurred in 1213 when King James gave all English assets to the Reptilian Pope. Executorship remains with the British royal family, but actual ownership lies with the Roman Catholic Church.
The United States of America is not named after Amerigo Vespucci, as you learned in school. The Illuminati would never name a continent, actually two continents, after an Italian mapmaker. The name is actually a combination of words.",conspiracy,Zodiac
51,The Secret Teachings ...of All Ages Part 1/46 : The Ancient Mysteries and Secret Societies Which Have Influenced Modern Masonic Symbolism,20.0,erctz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/erctz6/the_secret_teachings_of_all_ages_part_146_the/,12.0,1579524806.0,"WHEN confronted with a problem involving the use of the reasoning faculties, individuals of strong intellect keep their poise, and seek to reach a solution by obtaining facts bearing upon the question. Those of immature mentality, on the other hand, when similarly confronted, are overwhelmed. While the former may be qualified to solve the riddle of their own destiny, the latter must be led like a flock of sheep and taught in simple language. They depend almost entirely upon the ministrations of the shepherd. The Apostle Paul said that these little ones must be fed with milk, but that meat is the food of strong men. Thought*less*ness is almost synonymous with childishness, while thought*ful*ness is symbolic of maturity.

There are, however, but few mature minds in the world; and thus it was that the philosophic-religious doctrines of the pagans were divided to meet the needs of these two fundamental groups of human intellect--one philosophic, the other incapable of appreciating the deeper mysteries of life. To the discerning few were revealed the *esoteric*, or spiritual, teachings, while the unqualified many received only the literal, or *exoteric*, interpretations. In order to make simple the great truths of Nature and the abstract principles of natural law, the vital forces of the universe were personified, becoming the gods and goddesses of the ancient mythologies. While the ignorant multitudes brought their offerings to the altars of Priapus and Pan (deities representing the procreative energies), the wise recognized in these marble statues only symbolic concretions of great abstract truths.

In all cities of the ancient world were temples for public worship and offering. In every community also were philosophers and mystics, deeply versed in Nature's lore. These individuals were usually banded together, forming seclusive philosophic and religious schools. The more important of these groups were known as the *Mysteries*. Many of the great minds of antiquity were initiated into these secret fraternities by strange and mysterious rites, some of which were extremely cruel. Alexander Wilder defines the Mysteries as ""Sacred dramas performed at stated periods. The most celebrated were those of Isis, Sabazius, Cybele, and Eleusis."" After being admitted, the initiates were instructed in the secret wisdom which had been preserved for ages. Plato, an initiate of one of these sacred orders, was severely criticized because in his writings he revealed to the public many of the secret philosophic principles of the Mysteries.

Every pagan nation had (and has) not only its state religion, but another into which the philosophic elect alone have gained entrance. Many of these ancient cults vanished from the earth without revealing their secrets, but a few have survived the test of ages and their mysterious symbols are still preserved. Much of the ritualism of Freemasonry is based on the trials to which candidates were subjected by the ancient hierophants before the keys of wisdom were entrusted to them.

Few realize the extent to which the ancient secret schools influenced contemporary intellects and, through those minds, posterity. Robert Macoy, 33°, in his *General History of Freemasonry*, pays a magnificent tribute to the part played by the ancient Mysteries in the rearing of the edifice of human culture. He says, in part: ""It appears that all the perfection of civilization, and all the advancement made in philosophy, science, and art among the ancients are due to those institutions which, under the veil of mystery, sought to illustrate the sublimest truths of religion, morality, and virtue, and impress them on the hearts of their disciples.\* \* \* Their chief object was to teach the doctrine of one God, the resurrection of man to eternal life, the dignity of the human soul, and to lead the people to see the shadow of the deity, in the beauty, magnificence, and splendor of the universe.""

With the decline of virtue, which has preceded the destruction of every nation of history, the Mysteries became perverted. Sorcery took the place of the divine magic. Indescribable practices (such as the Bacchanalia) were introduced, and perversion ruled supreme; for no institution can be any better than the members of which it is composed. In despair, the few who were true sought to preserve the secret doctrines from oblivion. In some cases they succeeded, but more often the arcanum was lost and only the empty shell of the Mysteries remained.

Thomas Taylor has written, ""Man is naturally a religious animal."" From the earliest dawning of his consciousness, man has worshiped and revered *things* as symbolic of the invisible, omnipresent, indescribable *Thing*, concerning which he could discover practically nothing. The pagan Mysteries opposed the Christians during the early centuries of their church, declaring that the new faith (Christianity) did not demand virtue and integrity as requisites for salvation. Celsus expressed himself on the subject in the following caustic terms:

>""That I do not, however, accuse the Christians more bitterly than truth compels, may be conjectured from hence, that the cryers who call men to other mysteries proclaim as follows: 'Let him approach whose hands are pure, and whose words are wise.' And again, others proclaim: 'Let him approach who is pure from all wickedness, whose soul is not conscious of any evil, and who leads a just and upright life.' And these things are proclaimed by those who promise a purification from error. Let us now hear who those are that are called to the Christian mysteries: Whoever is a sinner, whoever is unwise, whoever is a fool, and whoever, in short, is miserable, him the kingdom of God will receive. Do you not, therefore, call a sinner, an unjust man, a thief, a housebreaker, a wizard, one who is sacrilegious, and a robber of sepulchres? What other persons would the cryer nominate, who should call robbers together?""

It was not the true faith of the early Christian mystics that Celsus attacked, but the false forms that were creeping in even during his day. The ideals of early Christianity were based upon the high moral standards of the pagan Mysteries, and the first Christians who met under the city of Rome used as their places of worship the subterranean temples of Mithras, from whose cult has been borrowed much of the sacerdotalism of the modem church.

The ancient philosophers believed that no man could live intelligently who did not have a fundamental knowledge of Nature and her laws. Before man can obey, he must understand, and the Mysteries were devoted to instructing man concerning the operation of divine law in the terrestrial sphere. Few of the early cults actually worshiped anthropomorphic deities, although their symbolism might lead one to believe they did. They were moralistic rather than religionistic; philosophic rather than theologic. They taught man to use his faculties more intelligently, to be patient in the face of adversity, to be courageous when confronted by danger, to be true in the midst of temptation, and, most of all, to view a worthy life as the most acceptable sacrifice to God, and his body as an altar sacred to the Deity.

Sun worship played an important part in nearly all the early pagan Mysteries. This indicates the probability of their Atlantean origin, for the people of Atlantis were sun worshipers. The Solar Deity was usually personified as a beautiful youth, with long golden hair to symbolize the rays of the sun. This golden Sun God was slain by wicked ruffians, who personified the evil principle of the universe. By means of certain rituals and ceremonies, symbolic of purification and regeneration, this wonderful God of Good was brought back to life and became the Savior of His people. The secret processes whereby He was resurrected symbolized those cultures by means of which man is able to overcome his lower nature, master his appetites, and give expression to the higher side of himself. The Mysteries were organized for the purpose of assisting the struggling human creature to reawaken the spiritual powers which, surrounded by the flaming

ring of lust and degeneracy, lay asleep within his soul. In other words, man was offered a way by which he could regain his lost estate. (See Wagner's *Siegfried*.)

In the ancient world, nearly all the secret societies were philosophic and religious. During the mediæval centuries, they were chiefly religious and political, although a few philosophic schools remained. In modern times, secret societies, in the Occidental countries, are largely political or fraternal, although in a few of them, as in Masonry, the ancient religious and philosophic principles still survive.

Space prohibits a detailed discussion of the secret schools. There were literally scores of these ancient cults, with branches in all parts of the Eastern and Western worlds. Some, such as those of Pythagoras and the Hermetists, show a decided Oriental influence, while the Rosicrucians, according to their own proclamations, gained much of their wisdom from Arabian mystics. Although the Mystery schools are usually associated with civilization, there is evidence that the most uncivilized peoples of prehistoric times had a knowledge of them. Natives of distant islands, many in the lowest forms of savagery, have mystic rituals and secret practices which, although primitive, are of a decided Masonic tinge.

## THE DRUIDIC MYSTERIES OF BRITAIN AND GAUL

>""The original and primitive inhabitants of Britain, at some remote period, revived and reformed their national institutes. Their priest, or instructor, had hitherto been simply named Gwydd, but it was considered to have become necessary to divide this office between the national, or superior, priest and another whose influence \[would\] be more limited. From henceforth the former became Der-Wydd (Druid), or superior instructor, and \[the latter\] Go-Wydd, or O-Vydd (Ovate), subordinate instructor; and both went by the general name of Beirdd (Bards), or teachers of wisdom. As the system matured and augmented, the Bardic Order consisted of three classes, the Druids, Beirdd Braint, or privileged Bards, and Ovates."" (See Samuel Meyrick and Charles Smith, *The Costume of The Original Inhabitants of The British Islands*.)

The origin of the word *Druid* is under dispute. Max Müller believes that, like the Irish word *Drui*, it means ""the men of the oak trees."" He further draws attention to the fact that the forest gods and tree deities of the Greeks were called *dryades*. Some believe the word to be of Teutonic origin; others ascribe it to the Welsh. A few trace it to the Gaelic *druidh*, which means ""a wise man"" or ""a sorcerer."" In Sanskrit the word *dru* means ""timber.""

At the time of the Roman conquest, the Druids were thoroughly ensconced in Britain and Gaul. Their power over the people was unquestioned, and there were instances in which armies, about to attack each other, sheathed their swords when ordered to do so by the white-robed Druids. No undertaking of great importance was scatted without the assistance of these patriarchs, who stood as mediators between the gods and men. The Druidic Order is deservedly credited with having had a deep understanding of Nature and her laws. The *Encyclopædia Britannica* states that geography, physical science, natural theology, and astrology were their favorite studies. The Druids had a fundamental knowledge of medicine, especially the use of herbs and *simples*. Crude surgical instruments also have been found in England and Ireland. An odd treatise on early British medicine states that every practitioner was expected to have a garden or back yard for the growing of certain herbs necessary to his profession. Eliphas Levi, the celebrated transcendentalist, makes the following significant statement:

>""The Druids were priests and physicians, curing by magnetism and charging amylets with their fluidic influence. Their universal remedies were mistletoe and serpents' eggs, because these substances attract the astral light in a special manner. The solemnity with which mistletoe was cut down drew upon this plant the popular confidence and rendered it powerfully magnetic. \* \* \* The progress of magnetism will some day reveal to us the absorbing properties of mistletoe. We shall then understand the secret of those spongy growths which drew the unused virtues of plants and become surcharged with tinctures and savors. Mushrooms, truffles, gall on trees, and the different kinds of mistletoe will be employed with understanding by a medical science, which will be new because it is old \* \* \* but one must not move quicker than science, which recedes that it may advance the further. "" (See *The History of Magic*.)

Not only was the mistletoe sacred as symbolic of the universal medicine, or panacea, but also because of the fact that it grew upon the oak tree. Through the symbol of the oak, the Druids worshiped the Supreme Deity; therefore, anything growing upon that tree was sacred to Him. At certain seasons, according to the positions of the sun, moon, and stars, the Arch-Druid climbed the oak tree and cut the mistletoe with a golden sickle consecrated for that service. The parasitic growth was caught in white cloths provided for the purpose, lest it touch the earth and be polluted by terrestrial vibrations. Usually a sacrifice of a white bull was made under the tree.

The Druids were initiates of a secret school that existed in their midst. This school, which closely resembled the Bacchic and Eleusinian Mysteries of Greece or the Egyptian rites of Isis and Osiris, is justly designated the *Druidic Mysteries*. There has been much speculation concerning the secret wisdom that the Druids claimed to possess. Their secret teachings were never written, but were communicated orally to specially prepared candidates. Robert Brown, 32°, is of the opinion that the British priests secured their information from Tyrian and Phœnician navigators who, thousands of years before the Christian Era, established colonies in Britain and Gaul while searching for tin. Thomas Maurice, in his *Indian Antiquities*, discourses at length on Phœnician, Carthaginian, and Greek expeditions to the British Isles for the purpose of procuring tin. Others are of the opinion that the Mysteries as celebrated by the Druids were of Oriental origin, possibly Buddhistic.

The proximity of the British Isles to the lost Atlantis may account for the sun worship which plays an important part in the rituals of Druidism. According to Artemidorus, Ceres and Persephone were worshiped on an island close to Britain with rites and ceremonies similar to those of Samothrace. There is no doubt that the Druidic Pantheon includes a large number of Greek and Roman deities. This greatly amazed Cæsar during his conquest of Britain and Gaul, and caused him to affirm that these tribes adored Mercury, Apollo, Mars, and Jupiter, in a manner similar to that of the Latin countries. It is almost certain that the Druidic Mysteries were not indigenous to Britain or Gaul, but migrated from one of the more ancient civilizations.

The school of the Druids was divided into three distinct parts, and the secret teachings embodied therein are practically the same as the mysteries concealed under the allegories of Blue Lodge Masonry. The lowest of the three divisions was that of Ovate (Ovydd). This was an honorary degree, requiring no special purification or preparation. The Ovates dressed in green, the Druidic color of learning, and were expected to know something about medicine, astronomy, poetry if possible, and sometimes music. An Ovate was an individual admitted to the Druidic Order because of his general excellence and superior knowledge concerning the problems of life.

The second division was that of Bard (Beirdd). Its members were robed in sky-blue, to represent harmony and truth, and to them was assigned the labor of memorizing, at least in part, the twenty thousand verses of Druidic sacred poetry. They were often pictured with the primitive British or Irish harp--an instrument strung with human hair, and having as many strings as there were ribs on one side of the human body. These Bards were often chosen as teachers of candidates seeking entrance into the Druidic Mysteries. Neophytes wore striped robes of blue, green, and white, these being the three sacred colors of the Druidic Order.

The third division was that of Druid (Derwyddon). Its particular labor was to minister to the religious needs of the people. To reach this dignity, the candidate must first become a Bard Braint. The Druids always dressed in white--symbolic of their purity, and the color used by them to symbolize the sun.

In order to reach the exalted position of *Arch-Druid*, or spiritual head of the organization, it was necessary for a priest to pass through the six successive degrees of the Druidic Order. (The members of the different degrees were differentiated by the colors of their sashes, for all of them wore robes of white.) Some writers are of the opinion that the title of *Arch-Druid* was hereditary, descending from father to son, but it is more probable that the honor was conferred by ballot election.

[ THE ARCH-DRUID IN HIS CEREMONIAL ROBES. ](https://preview.redd.it/c9flju3ckxb41.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=53b402b19476b3407f1df70bebb35a0a70a1c9c0)

||**he most striking adornment of the Arch-Druid was the** ***iodhan moran***\*\*, or breastplate of judgment, which possessed the mysterious Power of strangling any who made an untrue statement while wearing it. Godfrey Higgins states that this breastplate was put on the necks of witnesses to test the veracity of their evidence. The Druidic\*\* ***tiara***\*\*, or\*\* ***anguinum***\*\*, its front embossed with a number of points to represent the sun's rays, indicated that the priest was a personification of the rising sun. On the front of his belt the Arch-Druid wore the\*\* ***liath meisicith***\*\*--a magic brooch, or buckle in the center of which was a large white stone. To this was attributed the power of drawing the fire of the gods down from heaven at the priest's command This specially cut stone was a burning glass, by which the sun's rays were concentrated to light the altar fires. The Druids also had other symbolic implements, such as the peculiarly shaped golden sickle with which they cut the mistletoe from the oak, and the\*\* ***cornan***\*\*, or scepter, in the form of a crescent, symbolic of the sixth day of the increasing moon and also of the Ark of Noah. An early initiate of the Druidic Mysteries related that admission to their midnight ceremony was gained by means of a glass boat, called\*\* ***Cwrwg Gwydrin***\*\*. This boat symbolized the moon, which, floating upon the waters of eternity, preserved the seeds of living creatures within its boatlike crescent.\*\*||

According to James Gardner, there were usually two *Arch-Druids* in Britain, one residing on the Isle of Anglesea and the other on the Isle of Man. Presumably there were others in Gaul. These dignitaries generally carried golden scepters and were crowned with wreaths of oak leaves, symbolic of their authority. The younger members of the Druidic Order were clean-shaven and modestly dressed, but the more aged had long gray beards and wore magnificent golden ornaments. The educational system of the Druids in Britain was superior to that of their colleagues on the Continent, and consequently many of the Gallic youths were sent to the Druidic colleges in Britain for their philosophical instruction and training.

Eliphas Levi states that the Druids lived in strict abstinence, studied the natural sciences, preserved the deepest secrecy, and admitted new members only after long probationary periods. Many of the priests of the order lived in buildings not unlike the monasteries of the modern world. They were associated in groups like ascetics of the Far East. Although celibacy was not demanded of them, few married. Many of the Druids retired from the world and lived as recluses in caves, in rough-stone houses, or in little shacks built in the depths of a forest. Here they prayed and medicated, emerging only to perform their religious duties.

James Freeman Clarke, in his *Ten Great Religions*, describes the beliefs of the Druids as follows: ""The Druids believed in three worlds and in transmigration from one to the other: In a world above this, in which happiness predominated; a world below, of misery; and this present state. This transmigration was to punish and reward and also to purify the soul. In the present world, said they, Good and Evil are so exactly balanced that man has the utmost freedom and is able to choose or reject either. The Welsh Triads tell us there are three objects of metempsychosis: to collect into the soul the properties of all being, to acquire a knowledge of all things, and to get power to conquer evil. There are also, they say, three kinds of knowledge: knowledge of the nature of each thing, of its cause, and its influence. There are three things which continually grow less: darkness, falsehood, and death. There are three which constantly increase: light, life, and truth.""

Like nearly all schools of the Mysteries, the teachings of the Druids were divided into two distinct sections. The simpler, a moral code, was taught to all the people, while the deeper, esoteric doctrine was given only to initiated priests. To be admitted to the order, a candidate was required to be of good family and of high moral character. No important secrets were intrusted to him until he had been tempted in many ways and his strength of character severely tried. The Druids taught the people of Britain and Gaul concerning the immortality of the soul. They believed in transmigration and apparently in reincarnation. They borrowed in one life, promising to pay back in the next. They believed in a purgatorial type of hell where they would be purged of their sins, afterward passing on to the happiness of unity with the gods. The Druids taught that all men would be saved, but that some must return to earth many times to learn the lessons of human life and to overcome the inherent evil of their own natures.

Before a candidate was intrusted with the secret doctrines of the Druids, he was bound with a vow of secrecy. These doctrines were imparted only in the depths of forests and in the darkness of caves. In these places, far from the haunts of men, the neophyte was instructed concerning the creation of the universe, the personalities of the gods, the laws of Nature, the secrets of occult medicine, the mysteries of the celestial bodies, and the rudiments of magic and sorcery. The Druids had a great number of feast days. The new and full moon and the sixth day of the moon were sacred periods. It is believed that initiations took place only at the two solstices and the two equinoxes. At dawn of the 25th day of December, the birth of the Sun God was celebrated.

The secret teachings of the Druids are said by some to be tinctured with Pythagorean philosophy. The Druids had a Madonna, or Virgin Mother, with a Child in her arms, who was sacred to their Mysteries; and their Sun God was resurrected at the time of the year corresponding to that at which modern Christians celebrate Easter.

Both the cross and the serpent were sacred to the Druids, who made the former by cutting off all the branches of an oak tree and fastening one of them to the main trunk in the form of the letter T. This oaken cross became symbolic of their superior Deity. They also worshiped the sun, moon, and stars. The moon received their special veneration. Caesar stated that Mercury was one of the chief deities of the Gauls. The Druids are believed to have worshiped Mercury under the similitude of a stone cube. They also had great veneration for the Nature spirits (fairies, gnomes, and undines), little creatures of the forests and rivers to whom many offerings were made. Describing the temples of the Druids, Charles Heckethorn, in *The Secret Societies of All Ages & Countries*, says:

>""Their temples wherein the sacred fire was preserved were generally situate on eminences and in dense groves of oak, and assumed various forms--circular, because a circle was the emblem of the universe; oval, in allusion to the mundane egg, from which issued, according to the traditions of many nations, the universe, or, according to others, our first parents; serpentine, because a serpent was the symbol of Hu, the Druidic Osiris; cruciform, because a cross is an emblem of regeneration; or winged, to represent the motion of the Divine Spirit. \* \* \* Their chief deities were reducible to two--a male and a female, the great father and mother--Hu and Ceridwen, distinguished by the same characteristics as belong to Osiris and Isis, Bacchus and Ceres, or any other supreme god and goddess representing the two principles of all Being.""

Godfrey Higgins states that *Hu*, the Mighty, regarded as the first settler of Britain, came from a place which the Welsh *Triads* call the Summer Country, the present site of Constantinople. Albert Pike says that the Lost Word of Masonry is concealed in the name of the Druid god *Hu*. The meager information extant concerning the secret initiations of the Druids indicates a decided similarity between their Mystery school and the schools of Greece and Egypt. *Hu*, the Sun God, was murdered and, after a number of strange ordeals and mystic rituals, was restored to life.

There were three degrees of the Druidic Mysteries, but few successfully passed them all. The candidate was buried in a coffin, as symbolic of the death of the Sun God. The supreme test, however, was being sent out to sea in an open boat. While undergoing this ordeal, many lost their lives. Taliesin, an ancient scholar, who passed through the Mysteries, describes the initiation of the open boat in Faber's *Pagan Idolatry*. The few who passed this third degree were said to have been ""born again,"" and were instructed in the secret and hidden truths which the Druid priests had preserved from antiquity. From these initiates were chosen many of the dignitaries of the British religious and political world. (For further details, see Faber's *Pagan Idolatry*, Albert Pike's *Morals and Dogma*, and Godfrey Higgins' *Celtic Druids*.)

||**The most famous sculpturings and reliefs of this prototokos show Mithras kneeling upon the recumbent form of a great bull, into whose throat he is driving a sword. The slaying of the bull signifies that the rays of the sun, symbolized by the sword, release at the vernal equinox the vital essences of the earth--the blood of the bull--which, pouring from the wound made by the Sun God, fertilize the seeds of living things. Dogs were held sacred to the cult of Mithras, being symbolic of sincerity and trustworthiness. The Mithraics used the serpent a an emblem of Ahriman, the Spirit of Evil, and water rats were held sacred to him. The bull is esoterically the Constellation of Taurus; the serpent, its opposite in the zodiac, Scorpio; the sun, Mithras, entering into the side of the bull, slays the celestial creature and nourishes the universe with its blood.**||

The Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem confirms the theory that Jesus was born in a grotto, or cave. According to Dupuis, Mithras was put to death by crucifixion and rose again on the third day.**||

then a few years later i walked out of church, convinced that church was more of the same

i remember when Johnny Gosch and Eugene Martin got kidnapped. Googled Johnny Gosch when Google first came out, learned all about Franklin Coverup 

in the early 1990's when i first got online, i heard there was a flat earth society, so i found their website and went in to have a look around. they had a chat box, so i chatted with these guys for a while. i had to admit i was utterly stumped by everything they said, and also convinced that they were some seriously dedicated trolls. i decided to play along with flat earth, because who doesn't like to troll?

in 2017 I'm more convinced of flat earth than i am of big bang. stephen hawking is a puppet. his wikipedia biography reads like satire, because it is 

the moon landing hoax was another big red pill for me. i like this one because it is relatively easy to understand their claims, and relatively easy to understand why their claims are impossible, and thus false. also, this red pill implicates many various pillars of establishment, from science, to government, to media, to education... and its a relatively non-partisan issue. people don't automatically assume you are a D/R if you think the moon landing was a hoax 

9/11 big red pill for me. I had not really been exposed to anything other than the official story, until i saw the original *Loose Change* in about 2005. i have since come to believe that *Loose Change* was disinfo, produced by the same (((Zionists))) behind 9/11. i believe (((Wesley Clark's))) list of 7 nations pretty much describes the motive for the (((false flag)))

somewhere along the line, i became aware of the fact that the Iraq soldiers took the Kuwait babies out of the incubators and left them on the floor to die story was a big lie. i distinctly remember GHWB talking about incubator babies on TV, and i remember believing him, and i remember being outraged enough to support war to ""liberate Kuwait"". i was shocked to learn years later that GHWB was lying to me. 

somewhere along the line, i became aware that the US Secretary of State (((Madeline Albright))) said it was ""worth it"" to kill 500,000 children in Iraq

then Sandy Hook happened, and i was aware of the supposed shooting, but had no reason to question it

then the Boston Marathon Bombing happened, and i totally believed the story, and was very upset that someone would kill an 8 year old boy, so i took an interest in the still-develping story. 

my mind was not able to process what my eyes were seeing, and someone had to explain what ""crisis actors"" were to me, and they even sent me a link to crisisactors.org i was blown away that they were so brazen to even have a website, (although crisisactors.org vehemently denies they were involved with Sandy Hook, there are other companies that do the same thing, but ""Crisis Actors"" is what we call all of them)

the word ""hoax"" finally entered into popular lexicon on the internet, to describe all of these ""fake news"" stories

soon after the Boston Marathon Bombing a tornado in Moore, Oklahoma. i usually wouldn't have paid any attention to the tornado, except that ""the jester"", who was aligned with the so-called Boston Trolls/ Boston Shills on twitter inexplicably shifted from talking about Boston and started talking about Moore. after some digging, i discovered that Moore has had 3 tornados in only a few years, and that they recycle the images from one tornado to the next. 

also soon after Boston, there was an explosion in Texas, except the video of the explosion they showed on TV was actually from an explosion in 1988 in Hendersonville Nevada. 

then Rachel Maddow did her piece on how Obama's oil spill was recycled news. 

__

somewhere in here, it was noticed that these high profile fake news stories happen on a regular 6 week cycle. a website was even put up with a calendar that showed all the fake news on the day they happened, and even predicted future (((fake news))). the originators of the 6 week cycle theory had predicted the Boston Marathon Bombing to within the day. (April 15) . that website has since been scrubbed, and the internet was forum slide-ed with a bogus ""6 week cycle"" diet and exercise program whose sole purpose it to cover-up the 6 week cycle of (((false flag))) (((fake news)))

even today, this hurricane that has buried Houston is fabricated, in the sense that people are saying its man-made by cloud-seeding and HAARP (NEXRAD), and if you just watch how the media frames DJT during the crisis, then you will know why they did it. 

lately i have been focused on Autism and other side effects of vaccines, and i have been red-pilled on just how corrupt our so-called science is when it comes to vaccines and the safety of our children. our establishment knows or should know that vaccines cause autism, and they refuse to address the situation. 1 in 68 kids is ASD, and projections are looking like 1 in 50 or worse. we need to act now, with truth and reconciliation. 

i gotta say, i must be pretty damn naive, and slow to learn some of these tricks. 

even after 9/11, i assumed that 9/11 was more or less an isolated incident, as far as a (((false flag))) goes 

even after learning about Crisis Actors at Sandy Hook and Boston Marathon Bombing, 

i was still shocked to learn that Ferguson was staged as well, and that Rev Al Sharpton really is a race-traitor for participating in this fabricated narrative against the reputation of black people, particularly in Ferguson 

and slowly but surely i have come to the realization that everything on CNN is propaganda. 

you could literally take notes of ""the news"", and then go fact-check everything they say, and add the word ""hoax"" to your search, and you will find people de-constructing CNN

as an atheist, one of the all time biggest red pills was when i stepped back from it all, and took it all in, it its totality, and was at a loss for words as to how to describe it, other than to use words like ""evil"" or ""satan"" 

fortunately, 90% of the people have some sort of belief in ""God"" etc, so when you start using words like ""satan"" and ""evil"", a lot of other people already understand the language, and understand what you are trying to say. using this language bridges wide gaps across very diverse minds

March 30, 2002Q Status Alert!Top Eyes Only!

**Intelligence Briefing**

**(Not To Be Released To Outside Agencies, Departments, Executive, Legislative Or Judicial Branches Without Proper Internal Authorization)**

This agency announces that the aging code has been permanently broken making Biological Immortality a certainty. Please note that this is not a future event, and the data has been proven conclusively at this time through scientific testing.

Clarification

Biological/Physical Immortality, or the problem of death and dying, has been conquered permanently. The ***Human Genome Project*** under the direction of several Intelligence Community Agencies, TRINE, UMBRA, SACRED, JEHOVAH, MAJESTIC, ZODIAC, SPIRITUAL, ENVIRONMENT and MEDEA, has conquered mortal/physical death.

Data

Using information recently disseminated from the former ***USSR***, which this agency and others have been working with on various ***UFO/Extraterrestrial projects*** (including other countries with filed activity,) this agency received conclusive information on tested data concerning Biological Immortality.

***Extraterrestrial data*** received as far back as 1952 yielded the following conclusive information:

>**1)** All physical animal and/or human beings are in actuality (for lack of a better word) ***spirits attached to a human/flesh container***. Conclusive testing on animal and/or human subjects shows this can now be positively identified and proven.  
>  
>**2)** There is a physical/mental mechanism which prevents this data from becoming too closely and easily detected. Distortions of the data occur when mentally observed more closely. An example of this would be the common idea that human beings are made of flesh and have a soul. The correct data would be human beings are a spirit and attached to a body of flesh.  
>  
>**3)** It is because of this mental/physical distortion that those reading this briefing will have a hard time fully comprehending it, and the magnitude of the information contained within. Studies show when something is unclear or not understandable, that repeated reading of the same material can and will clear up any misunderstandings. It will take several readings by each individual for this information to become clarified.  
>  
>**4)** Triggers to this negative mental mechanism which create the distortion are linked directly to “fundamentalist” world religions as belief systems. The more fundamentalist the belief, the more strongly this mechanism is activated.  
>  
>**5)** ***Fundamentalism*** is hereby defined as a strict and literal interpretation of holy books and scriptures found in all major world religions.  
>  
>**6)** The trigger is not completely set in motion with non-fundamentalist religions. The mechanism does have some effect with all religions.  
>  
>**7)** ***Religions*** that promote an afterlife which is better than present Earth life have the strongest activation trigger. This then links to a secondary trigger which promotes quicker aging. This is due to the presumed fact, on the part of the human subject, that death is preferable to living and directly connected to thinking the afterlife will be beyond any pleasure current life can offer.  
>  
>**8)** These mechanisms also contain a doomsday effect. They bring into motion worldwide but man-made cataclysms through the above stated “*collective unconscious triggers*” (Parts A and B). Every human being has these triggers. They are intensely activated as aging continues, since as old age and physical death nears religious concepts become more important to the populace.  
>  
>**9)** Because of ***mental distortion*** (mentioned in item 2), individual humans under the effect of the triggers think a higher power or being, mostly referred to as *God*, directs these cataclysmic events (the *doomsday effect*.) It is “believed” on the part of the human subjects that *God* will destroy their particular religion’s enemies and usher in a better world for members of their same religion or sect. This is true of all people affected by these mental triggers, no matter what their religion.

&#x200B;

IMPORTANT\*\*:\*\*

**A)**   THE “BELIEF” THAT *GOD* DIRECTS THESE EVENTS IS INCORRECT.

**B)**   THESE EVENTS ARE MAN-MADE THROUGH SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY TAILORED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL RELIGION AND IT’S INTERPRETATION OF END OF THE WORLD EVENTS BY INDIVIDUALS.

**C)**   THESE INDIVIDUALS THEN WORK EITHER ALONE OR IN CONCERT WITH EACH OTHER (UNKNOWINGLY THROUGH THE TRIGGER MECHANISMS DESCRIBED) TO BRING ABOUT PLANETARY SELF-DESTRUCTION AND THE END OF THE HUMAN RACE.

**D)**   IT IS THE INTERPRETATION AND CARRYING OUT OF THESE ACTIONS BY HUMANS, WHICH IS CAUSING THE DOOMSDAY EFFECTS TO OCCUR.

**E)**   MAN IS CAUSING AND FULFILLING THESE ACTIONS AND SCENARIOS, NOT *GOD* IN IT’S MANY INTERPRETATIONS BY MANY DIFFERENT FAITHS.The Only Effect These Triggers Have Is The Total Destruction Of The Entire Human Race Through An End Of The World Scenario With Escalating Terrorism And Extensive Nuclear And Biological World War Becoming A Certainty.**10)** It is unclear at this time, how these mechanisms were originally transferred to the human populace, although there are various theories. It is only clear that items 1-9 are true and proven.

&#x200B;

**SOLUTIONS:**

>Current Data Since February 2002:

**1)** ***NASA*** has been successfully coordinated under various cover stories, but behind the scenes planetary exploration of our solar system is “*High Priority ‘Class A’ Status*” due to the effect of the trigger mechanisms being in full effect since [Sept. 11, 2001](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_911.htm)***.*** The computer matrixes used by this bureau, and those of the other coordinating worldwide intelligence agencies, indicate with 99.99% accuracy that since 9/11 extinction of the human race is imminent unless other planets are colonized quickly, and/or numerous artificial space stations are created and used. The information contained within previous briefings leading to the “*High Priority ‘Class A’ Status*” is on a “***Need To Know***” basis.

**2)** Most importantly, the **BI Project** (*Biological Immortality Project*) has been completed. The completion of this project was a necessary step due to the amount of time it takes for interplanetary travel to outreaching star systems that have planets which can sustain life and have similar eco-systems to Earth. Given enough time, our technological advancements under the direction of ***ET***’s would have been sufficient for interplanetary travel without ***BI***. Due to the shortage of time, ***BI*** was an easier project to complete with the information gleaned from the relatively new [Human Genome Project](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_adn02.htm).

**3)** We are requesting at this time a full list of those who must be “*immediately*” rescued from the current “trigger” situations underway planet wide. Those to be contacted must be of sound scientific mind and body, as well as clear of any religious affiliation that would allow the triggers (virus’) to continue once outside home planet range. After top-level personnel are transported, other parts of humanity will be salvaged as time allows.

**4)** The *Worldwide Intelligence Community*’s plan isn’t that any part of the human race should be lost, but instead the best be saved first. Projects are underway to implement this protocol as quickly and fairly as possible.

**5)** While it is understood that ***BI*** for the entire human race is a huge undertaking, it is also noted through the applied “problem/solution matrix” that once ***BI*** is implemented the “triggers” will cease to function, thus ending the majority of Earth conflict and war. The matrix continues by stating that not ALL conflict will end, but will become manageable by applying workable solutions.

**6)** The matrix calculates that ***BI*** will have far reaching effects for planetary human salvation. Once everyone possible has obtained ***BI*** successfully, worldwide peace will more easily be achieved, environmental, food and energy concerns will be handled, and afterwards the human race will be able to return to Earth if desired.

**7)** The matrix shows that those who do not opt for ***BI*** will cease to be part of the problem in due time, since ***BI*** is a prerequisite for planetary colonization/escape, and the “trigger mechanisms” will simply carry themselves to completion thus cleansing the virus and allowing planetary re-booting.

**8)** Those with “trigger mechanisms” will be given the opportunity to pursue ***BI***, but only after the “triggers” have been eliminated from their personal equation. Scientific processes will be in place shortly to remove those triggers. This bureau, or any other worldwide intelligence unit, will not force these processes or removal of triggers on anybody.

**9)** Since these triggers are intimately connected with personal religious beliefs, care will be taken to not violate the protections given to religion under the US Constitution or similar protective documents and laws worldwide in other countries.

**10)** The entire plan stated above must be executed within a 10 to 50 year timeline starting from the date of this briefing. The survival rate for the human race decreases exponentially every year after the first 10 until the 50th year is reached resulting in escalating and more insurmountable problems, which would make completion/escape near impossible.

**11)** ***NASA*** is to be given appropriate funding for their part of the project. Bypassing normal channels for funding will be used to expedite the process.

**12)** The ***Human Genome Project*** will receive continued funding as agreed. Bypassing normal channels for funding will be used to expedite the process.

**13)** All phases of this project are to be put into effect IMMEDIATELY!  Bypassing normal channels for funding and strategy implementation will be used to expedite the process.

**14)** The acting President Of The United States, along with other country leaders (US and others) will form their own cover stories concerning space exploration after they become briefed as to the seriousness of this information and the outcome of the scenario if action is not taken to expedite ***BI*** and colonization.

This  interview with David Berkowitz (Son of Sam, and also includes some very interesting opinions of Police investigators) seems to finally explain the baffling actions of that  man. It certainly has made me think there is some truth to his claims. I  tried to read up on this case and bits and pieces seem to be consistent  with what he is saying. He claims the SOS murders were the result of  several people, and the witness statements really do vary hugely and imply more than one person. He doesn't deny  responsibility and says he deserves to be locked up forever. He says even though he was involved in some killings he was to take the heat for a cult called The Process that was mainly responsible for these killings. He mentions that The Process had animal sacrifices  at a particular park, of German Shepherds. This is true, there were  mutilated dogs of that type found at the park where they were based, and  The Process Church has admitted to focusing on this animal, but they say, in a loving way. David famously originally claimed that a  neighbours dog told him to kill people.

Animal sacrifices (German Shepherds, the worshiped dogs of The Process) in Untermyer Park -  [https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ritualistic-sacrifice-and-the-son-of-sam-satan-worshiping-in-america-s-greatest-forgotten-garden](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ritualistic-sacrifice-and-the-son-of-sam-satan-worshiping-in-america-s-greatest-forgotten-garden)

What people may not  realise, is that the owner of David Berkowitz's next door dog does seem was a member of a cult, which seems to have been The Process as Berkowitz says so ( see [here](https://unsolved.com/gallery/son-of-sam/) and [here](https://forums.sherdog.com/threads/did-the-son-of-sam-really-act-alone-or-was-he-a-member-of-a-murderous-satanic-cult.3749461/page-3) ) and that he owned a distinctive yellow car matching one ID'd as moving fast away from one of the SOS killings. 

The Process cult originated in a rich suburb of London. It has apparently changed its identity. More oddities (my observation) - the Process used a very similar symbol to the Zodiac killers symbol on their literature, and I recall also that version was used in one image, also he was never caught, and the MO and targets of The Zodiac looks similar to David Berkowitz - Young healthy people and couples are senselessly targeted. The Process changed identity and moved  from the west coast allegedly eastwards and as they moved east, it has  been speculated they could tie in with other killers.

They have since disappeared without trace, except the female founder established an animal sanctuary in Utah, but are believed by some to have set up under a new identity.

For some more info on the SOS cultlink, this is 

Although tenuous, I believe there could be connections with other unsolved murders. The so-called  'Smiley Face' killer was a hypothesised serial killer that similarly  targets young, cream of the crop type students who were disposed in rivers and lakes. Certain indications are that most of those deaths,  occurring along the Interstate 94 corridor around the Great Lakes, are not natural and do seem to be murders, though once a drunk person goes missing, and later turns up in the water, it will almost always be  presumed as accidental. There is a detailed analysis by an ex cop and a  university criminologist called Case Studies in Drowning Forensics that  builds a strong case for the unnatural nature and demographics of these  deaths. And they support that this was likely the work of a group. At many of the deaths strange 'smiley face' graffiti was often found.  Whilst likely a coincidence, the retire Police officers who took up the  case on behalf of the parents states that the smiley faces they  identified at the hypothesised dumping points were not alike, were distinctive and are tags of specific gangs. One of the smiley faces has a  Zodiac style cross on the forehead, and, this cross was also carved into Charles Mansons forehead before he later converted it into a swastika. Charles Manson also appears to have connections to The Process, two members of which apparently visited him in Jail, after which Charles made an abrupt change in some of the things he was saying. A very loose connection therefore can be made between the symbols used by Manson and the Zodiac, and the claimed visitors of Manson in jail, The Process.

Although a few of the Smiley Face victims show definite signs of murder, the use of a drug like GHB or Scopolamine was not tested, except when the test was  specifically requested by the authors of Drowning Forensics, they then did indeed show suspicious levels of GHB.

It has been  suggested that slightly inebriated men had either their drinks spiked,  or were lured perhaps with women into a van, later drugged, perhaps  killed in a bath tub, and dumped in rivers. It appears to be the result of a group, which suggests a cult.

The forensic  evidence for these deaths include the fact that all are of a specific  age group, where, based on the demographics of alcohol drinkers, only  26% should be. The fact that most of these deaths occur in the winter,  spring and autumn, which is very rare, few people lark about on the  water except in the summer; in some cases they come from the same town  and frequented the same bars; the bodies turned up in the water floating face up, but nearly all males float face down after any length of time  according to the texts, which suggests they have been moved from land  after death, ligature marks on the neck, empty hands whereas natural  drownings the hands often are clutching weeds and show certain injuries  from thrashing, rigor mortis which always passes after a few days, yet  these men are going missing 2-3 weeks prior, and show virtually no  degradation, fly larvae that are of a house fly species and only lay on  land, the GHB and more besides. One victim was last seen staggering down  the road being followed by a car which stopped everytime the victim  staggered, which several witnesses reported as very suspicious.

Something similar may be happening in the UK. There are now 60 young  men, and it is exclusively men, pulled out of Manchester canals in the  last few years. Parents consider the deaths suspicious and have dubbed  the speculated killer as the Manchester Pusher. Police have not  supported these claims in any way and have not apparently even  considered it seriously.

The Freemasons have often been called satanic, which is something that they are very capable of fending off.

While its rank and file members are ignorant of the purpose of the organization, some know. Freemasons deflect accusations of being a satanic society largely by employing the cover of being a philanthropic organization. But what is at the core of the Freemasons' beliefs? It is the belief in a single architect of the universe.

Freemasonry is based upon the legend of the building of Solomon's Temple, which is said to have employed thousands of masons and stonecutters almost 3,000 years ago.  


[Masonic Symbolism](https://i.redd.it/elk726lnsbt81.gif)

For many reasons, we cannot verify Masonic history too easily. Some Attas have investigated Freemasonry, both from within by infiltration and from without by investigation. Thomas Paine is one of the Attas who undertook the task from without, while other Attas like Benjamin Franklin and Mark Twain infiltrated the organization.

Franklin disclosed many of the secrets of Freemasonry to Thomas Paine and also provided him with copies of various records from some lodges.

For this, Franklin was singled out for express criticism by Illuminati founder and high-ranking Freemason and contemporary **Adam Weisshaupt**, who is legendary for his devious and twisted behavior and character. It was Weisshaupt who supposedly *founded the New World Order*. However, he was more of a shill for the ruling elite and did as he was directed.  


After thoroughly investigating the organization, Paine argued well that Freemason historians either will not produce the facts, or they do not know them. To show the enormous corruption by Freemason historians, Paine noted that according to Masonic history, **Pythagoras** of 580 B.C. was supposed to be an early initiate of a frontrunner sodality of the Freemasons.

However, according to their history, the society was fully established during the time of the building of King Solomon's Temple, which was completed more than 300 years before Pythagoras was born. Pythagoras is one of the Attas. Freemasons falsely claim that he was a member of their society.  


Since *its own history is corrupted beyond recognition* and its historians refuse to correct it, this discussion will attempt to explain some pertinent Masonic legends and further explain the actual history. The reader should ever consider why the Freemasons would lie about their history while contemplating things Masonic.  


According to Hebrew legend, two of the main characters are King Solomon and Hiram, King of Tyre. These kings got together and decided to build a fabulous temple. They then employed Hiram Abiff, a master craftsman of wide renown, to adorn the temple and beautify it.  


According to Masonic legend, just before the completion of the temple, three ruffians conspired to extract the secrets of Master Mason from Abiff. They were unable to extract the secrets by force but ended up killing Abiff.  


The ruffians hid the body in the temple, then carted it away and buried it. When King Solomon was informed that Abiff was missing, he was furious and took a roll call of the craft, and found three were missing. These were the three ruffians. The king blocked the harbors and roads and sent out search parties. Finally, the three ruffians were found and brought before King Solomon, to whom they confessed. Solomon ordered each of them to be executed in vile, horrific ways, with terrible torture and severing of body parts.  


Thereafter, King Solomon and King Hiram dug up his grave to look all over him for a clue to the syllable. When none was found, they raised Abiff from his grave and buried him near the temple, as close to the Holy of Holies as tradition would allow.  


However, in interpreting the Masonic history, some previously hidden aspects of the legend need to be presented. King Solomon and King Hiram had each acquired one syllable of a secret code ""word"". Abiff had the third syllable. The two kings and Abiff were going to use the secret ""word"" to perform a ritual in the Holy of Holies after the completion of the temple. (This information is only available to a very small group of the very highest level of the Freemasons' hierarchy.)  


This is a very dark story - Solomon, who was a tyrant, wanted SOLE possession of the ""word"". He hired three ruffians to extract the secret syllable from Abiff, who was in the temple when the ruffians approached him. One of the ruffians demanded the secret syllable from Abiff, who knew something was very wrong because only Solomon and Hiram knew he possessed a secret syllable.

Abiff was able to trick them into revealing Solomon had sent them before he bolted and fled. The ruffians gave chase, captured him, and then killed him. They then dragged the body off and buried it far away from the temple. The ruffians then reported the incident to Solomon, who immediately had them executed and dismembered.

The immediate killings of the ruffians were done as punishment for them and also because it was necessary to silence them.

Since the ruffians killed Abiff before extracting the secret from him, the syllable was lost. At the funeral, the two kings were truly upset because they had lost the opportunity to use the power of the secret code. They vowed to one day discover the lost word. Meanwhile, they substituted a word that sounds like ""mor-bon-zi"" for the lost word.

Today, this substituted word is the *Grand Masonic ""word""* according to Masonic history. It is believed that Solomon and Hiram passed on their two parts of the secret word to very trusted members only and that these knowing members likewise passed it on to other trusted members. Today, the very few with this knowledge are very actively searching for the lost syllable so they can utter the real three-part secret word or the actual lost ""word"".  


Since *mor-bon-zi* is only a substitute secret word, all Masons are given it and recognize it to this day. However, *mor-bon-zi* is very rarely spoken except during initiations or on very special occasions, and then only in a low breath. The password the Masons use in everyday matters is ""tu-bal-cain.""  


It should be noted that present-day Freemasons claim in a higher degree than they have found the lost *""word"" of God*. This word is given to candidates for the Holy Royal Arch.

That word is ""jah-bul-on"", which is believed to be:

>""jah"" for the Hebrew god Yahweh  
""bul"" for the ancient Canaanite fertility god Baal and Devil  
""on"" for the Egyptian god of the underworld called Osiris

This ""word of god"" presented as ""jah-bul-on"" is another Freemason Weisshaupt-like deception to trick some candidates into thinking the search for the word is concluded.

But, ""jah-bul-on"" is only another substituted word. The search for the *lost ""word""* secretly continues.

Who were these three people really? Why did they have the secret parts to the secret ""word""? Does the ""word"" have power?

King Solomon, King Hiram, and Abiff were secretly occultists. They tried to hide this information and to severely limit and discourage those who would pursue occult matters. One such indication of this appears in the extant Bible in a book attributed to Solomon.

He did not write the entire book, but he did plagiarize this verse:

>Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman: That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.  
**Proverbs 7:4-5.**

The church tries to give other interpretations, but what this really means is that wisdom and understanding should be treasured, but occult knowledge must be shunned, as it is dangerous. Many of the Proverbs make sense when interpreting the ""strange woman"" to be the occult mysteries, which otherwise seem to be non-sequiturs.

The Bible is replete with warnings to avoid stargazers, mediums, magicians, wizards, witches, sorcerers, seers, fortune tellers, and the like. This was especially true during the reign of King Josiah of Israel. However, the Bible also shows that the religious leaders understood the esoteric (occult) power of sounds, letters, words, names, symbols, astrology, numbers, etc.

One example of comprehension of the power of sounds and names is when Abram's name was changed to Abraham by the Hebrew *God* according to Genesis 17:5.

In fact, many religious leaders knowingly use occult powers whilst they keep the flock ignorant and fearful of the secret knowledge. Solomon is legendary for his supposed wisdom, however, his work with the occult is more hidden. King Solomon and King Hiram, along with Abiff, were practicing occultists, but in the area of Dark arts. They were directed to build a huge temple that was to be dedicated to the higher forces of the Dark side.

To gain maximum empowerment for the temple, much suffering was necessary for the construction of it. This was accomplished by blood sacrifice and enslavement of the stonecutters and masons who were forced to build the temple and by imposing oppressive taxation. These and other measures culminated in a revolt.

When completed, the temple was to contain a Holy of Holies, where the three of them were to meet from time to time to conjure up the full power of Darkness associated with the Anunnaki Elite who were no longer on Earth. This was to be done by ritually calling down the Dark power via the ""word"". Once the temple (or any other object), specifically the Holy of Holies within the temple, was charged, it would take on a life of its own. It has a power of its own. However, the Holy of Holies was never charged in the way it was anticipated because Abiff was murdered before the temple was completed.  


The three sounds given to Solomon, Hiram, and Abiff respectively, form the actual *secret lost ""word""* that Freemasons are seeking. When these are uttered in proper pitch, duration, order, timing, and intensity the composite sound can call upon power from the subtle level.

This particular formula has the ability to summon the full power of Darkness.  


This is no small power; it cannot be overstated how powerful it is. Anyone who possesses the key to this power can virtually control the entire world and hold any nation ransom. This is not a joking matter and one not to be taken lightly. Imagine what would have happened if Solomon had possessed the complete ""word"". This ""word"" is what Hitler was secretly searching for. In the wrong hands, this ""word"" could be absolutely disastrous.  


The Freemasons are all raised to the third degree with the story of Abiff and the substitute word. This is because very few Masons know about the actual two separate syllables, but those who know are actively searching for the lost sound. They hope that some candidate will reveal it. They also hope that some Master Mason will discover it. However, none of the vast majority of Masons has any idea of this secret agenda. And, after nearly 3,000 years of searching, the secret ""word"" of Abiff's is still unknown to them.  


Adam Weisshaupt was an agent for some people who had learned King Solomon's and King Hiram's syllables, and they directed him to start the New World Order in the hopes that it would assist in locating the lost syllable. Weisshaupt's controllers believed that if there were a single dictator of the world, then all information about everyone and everything would be at the disposal of the regime.  


Sounds are very powerful vibrations/energies when used in a certain way with knowledge.

For example, the death of Diana Spencer appears to have been caused by physical agents. However, it was actually brought about by forces embedded in the spoken word directed from the unseen level, which brought about the physical manifestation of her death. People who are involved with Dark forces can get themselves into very serious situations. This is why the fabled ""pure"" heart comes out repeatedly in legends, telling of one who can properly use occult powers.  


I know Solomon's and Hiram's sounds or syllables. I also know Abiff's sound. I know the entire lost ""word"". How I know this is irrelevant. Equally, whether anyone believes my assertion or not, is irrelevant.

Even when I first mentally reviewed this sound I could feel the tremendous Dark power of the ""word"". I also have the counter-sound which I used to neutralize the Dark ""word"". Now, the complete, dreadful Dark secret ""word"" that Freemasons seek to assemble has been contained and neutralized.  


Bear in mind that some Freemasons may know the first two sounds or syllables of the ""word"". And now, others will know them. But, I will never disclose the lost sound from the Anunnaki Elite to anyone because of the highly dangerous nature of the Dark energy embedded in the ""word"" that could be ""resurrected"" if it fell into the wrong hands - that is, ANYONE without a ""pure"" heart.

THIS SYLLABLE HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED, WRITTEN, TRANSCRIBED, OR IMPARTED TO ANYONE.

No search will discover it. In any event, I already neutralized the entire ""word"" with the counter-sound. I released this counter-sound of the Light in 2002 on a CD entitled Loving You because the counter-sound can also be used to counter-act other energies that are directed by Darkness.  


I now disclose the two sounds.

>King Solomon's syllable is ""KIR""  
King Hiram's syllable is ""WHAH""

Abiff's syllable has eluded those of Darkness for 3,000 years, and they will not acquire it before this virtual reality collapses.  


As a cautionary warning, any attempt by anyone sending thoughts with any EVIL INTENT to either attack this information or to abuse the disclosed sounds will automatically be deflected and returned to the sender. The sender with such evil intent will reap instant or delayed consequences of his or her own actions.  


Returning to the Masonic legend, it should be stated that the horrible deaths the three ruffians suffered are now part of the obligation of Masons in the first three degrees of Masonry. When a person is awarded a degree, he must utter the obligation under penalty of suffering like death if ever he were to reveal the secrets of a Master Mason.

The candidates are told that the oaths and penalties are only symbolic and would have no bearing in reality, which is true if Master Mason were to give away the secrets known to the general members of the secret society. However, the information about the original secret ""word"" is the secret information that those oaths are designed to protect against any disclosure.

They are real oaths with real penalties.  


The term ""Freemasons"" is very revealing. Solomon had slaves building the temple. But some of the tradesmen were not slaves; they were freemasons. Likewise, the term ""Master Masons"" has the same significance. Those of that rank were the slave masters or the teachers.  


Solomon was a king who was reputed to have had many wives and concubines. He did not let women worship with men, nor join secret societies. The divine right of kingship, slavery, male dominance, and polygamy are characteristic traits of the Anunnaki, and Solomon was a descendant of the Anunnaki Remnants from Atlantis. That is how he acquired his position.

Reference to *Solomon being a descendant of Anunnaki* should not be confused with *having blood ties* to them. This refers to his consciousness, which incarnates over and over in different biological bodies, regardless of biological connections.  


Similarly, the King of Tyre and Abiff both had Anunnaki roots. The three of them were familiar with occult knowledge and because of their dedication to the occult arts, it was revealed to them that certain sounds have very powerful properties. Each of them had been given a sound capable of bringing down special powers of the highest and darkest realm.

This was done only after a lot of blood sacrifices which proved their loyalty to Darkness. Through this process, each of them had acquired one part of the three-part word. They were impressed to build the temple, where there was to be a Holy of Holies, where they were to perform the ritual of summoning the power of the ""word"". It was important to have slaves build the temple, as the suffering of the slaves added greatly to the potential of the secret sound. Moreover, as described above, the executions demonstrate yet another Anunnaki trait.

Likewise, Freemasons also thrive on bloodlust as seen by their sanctifying of the brutal, horrible, demonic killings of the three ruffians.  


Many, including **Thomas Paine**, have compared the practice of Freemasonry with Christianity. Paine concluded that both worship the physical sun, although it is disguised in Christianity to appear to be the worship of *Jesus*, whom they call the *Son of God*. Darkness imitated the Divine Mother and the ""Twelve Sisters"" by creating the Sun and the twelve signs of the Zodiac.  


Christianity was not founded by *Jesus*. The work of the early Christians and the propaganda of Paul and those who hid behind the name of *Jesus* all contributed to the invention of a marvelous story which resulted in *Jesus* being known to this day as the founder of a religion that was never his.

Similarly, *Jesus* is falsely associated with the Ascended Masters in the Theosophical teaching. Christianity only became orthodox when Emperor Constantine and the church councils created creeds and canons at the Council of Nicea in 325 A.D. With this human-made church law, the followers of Christianity no longer abide by the teachings of *Jesus* but instead follow the dictates of the church.

These gruesome symbolic acts are signs of cannibalism and vampirism. These acts are falsely presented at least four times in the extant Bible to give the church and its followers apparent authority and authenticity to practice the repulsive rites.

Nearly all Christian churches display crosses to remind followers of the horrible *murder* of *Jesus*. Many of the crosses bear a male figure nailed onto them to represent Jesus, who is graphically displayed in a gory and agonizing depiction of his murder on a cross.

This depiction is grotesquely objectionable to any thinking, feeling beings.

>Can you see the similarity between Christianity and Freemasonry?  
What kind of a ""god"" would thirst for blood?  
What kind of a ""god"" would want gruesome murders re-lived over and over in the human psyche?

With regard to Christians - it is far worse than the Masons.

According to many Freemasons, Abiff supposedly represents *Jesus* \- who incidentally had not yet been born when Solomon was in power. But, Christianity symbolically does those dreadful things to the one they claim to believe is the son of the *God* of light.

So there you have it - Yes, it appears quite clearly that Freemasons, however unwittingly, are devil worshippers. Similarly, Christians, however unwittingly, are also worshipping Satan.

Darkness has always coveted that of the Light; it also corrupts that of the Light whenever possible, as can be seen in Christianity.

The violet color is one of the distinct colors of the Divine Mother and she extended it to the ""Twelve Sisters"" with the power of true transmutation. Evil coveted this power of transmutation and attempted to simulate it as Evil often does, stealing designs/concepts/ideas/patterns, etc. from the Light, then corrupting them and claiming them as Its own.

With regard to transmutation, it needs to be mentioned that the energy in the physical realm is trapped within Matter. This energy is very different from the energy of the True Divine Creation.

An analogy can be drawn by considering the micro-level in this realm, where electrons could be compared to being drivers of energy, not the masters of energy as some have speculated. Protons and neutrons act as trapping agents - they trap electrons and force them to work for the protons and neutrons.

The Demiurge usurped this sector of the *True Divine Creation* and later created a world of virtual reality. This realm is an illusion, a virtual reality. However, in this illusion, a great deal of abuse is done to True-Light beings.

The Demiurge created Matter and then gravity, which is the first cause in setting Matter into motion. Next, It created heat and cold, both of which can cause pseudo transmutation of Matter, and whose properties can also trap electrons. The electrons are akin to trapped Light beings in this dimension.

Gravity sustains physical motion. Many have theorized that because gravity is a weaker force than some other forces, it is not the primary force. This is erroneous. Gravity is the first cause and the critical force that holds this illusory universe together. Only later did the Demiurge create the strong and weak nuclear forces to better tighten and bond matter together, and later still, It created the electromagnetic force to seal off sections of the Evil Creation and to erase memories of beings in the virtual reality.

The physical universe is continually spinning but going nowhere. For example, there is the perceived rotation of the ages - the signs of the Zodiac. They repeat the cycle over and over without real progress.

That is the plan of the *Demiurge*.

Gravity is the first force of attraction. Motion is keeping the illusion going by the sustaining properties of gravity. When gravity is dismantled, the balls will stop moving, and the entire illusion will crumble. There are particular energies that build virtual realities within virtual realities in this dimension.

This is because you are within the illusion of the merry-go-round and it becomes the reality of the moment. Try as you might, you can only catch glimpses of the outside world which you perceive to be spinning.

However, you know that you are spinning on the merry-go-round, not the world outside, whose movement is an illusion created by the merry-go-round.  


From a spiritual standpoint that sickness has so disoriented True-Light beings that they have forgotten their True Divine origin and think that they are part of the illusion. If the merry-go-round stops, the illusion stops, and all viable True-Light beings will be outside the virtual reality.  


The shattering of this illusion - this virtual reality - has commenced. Due to the complexities of illusions within illusions, it has taken a long time to dismantle them. Gravity, because of motion and inertia, is the primary cause holding things together for the time being. Once the virtual realities within the virtual reality are all shattered, all the True beings of the Light who are trapped here will be freed. This day will come. Everyone should try to break the mindset that the physical is all there is because that mindset is the biggest trap of all.

There is a *True Reality* out there, once these dreadful rides stop.

To do this defies the laws of physics in this realm, yet it occurred. It was the equivalent of walking through a wall while carrying a metal object with me.

While electrons are trapped by protons and neutrons on the atomic level, planets are trapped by stars or suns on the macro level. The sun of our solar system is the trap. It gives off False-Light, which the planets need to survive in this material realm. In exchange for this light, the sun forces the planets to revolve around it and to do all the work keeping the solar system bound together in the illusion which is driven by their orbits around the sun.

If the perpetual motion of the planets - the *merry-go-round* \- stops, the illusion crumbles, and all the viable True-Light beings in the entire solar system are liberated from the entrapments of Darkness.

Of course, the solar system is but a ride within a ride, as it is part of a galaxy, which is part of the universe. All of these rides are about to stop turning.

The sun is the main source of the illusion. Those who are part of the illusion will dissipate when the illusion collapses. Those who are not part of the illusion will continue to exist after virtual reality is over.

While *the sun is the biggest trap in the solar system*, it has the appearance of being of the greatest assistance and being the most important part of the system. The sun is not the driver of the solar system, the planets are. While the sun provides heat and light by which biological ""life"" is made possible, biological life is but another virtual reality that traps the True-Light beings.

Through being trapped in biological bodies, True-Light beings are forced to drive the world.

In this realm, Light looks dark, and Darkness appears as light.

Much has been said of late about the sun cruisers that have been photographed near the sun. A great deal of speculation has occurred as to what they are doing. They are crafts of the *True Divine Creation* which are here to extinguish the sun. They have done this to many stars in the virtual reality and freed many beings of Light from the grasp of Darkness by shattering the illusion of solar systems and unlocking the prison doors.

Sun cruisers were responsible for the extinguishment of the Anunnaki's home star ZA-OS, which in turn freed many beings of Light from the grasp of Darkness.

The Anunnaki were a very advanced race of beings and they had accomplished space travel before their star was extinguished. Being advanced technologically allowed the Anunnaki to spread their tentacles throughout the physical world as the main agents of the Demiurge. They are, in effect, angels of Darkness. They have been programmed to be as evil as the Demiurge, as ruthless, as brutal, as chauvinistic, and as hopelessly putrid as their ""father"".

[The Pyramid Of Manipulation](https://preview.redd.it/az8e7ob8sbt81.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27d1859c71149c0b810981dc2db661c5c97e8414)

The Anunnaki were given certain powers to assist the Demiurge in keeping the illusion going for as long as possible.

The Demiurge knows that its days are numbered, but it has extended those days by employing the dreadful Anunnaki, who are sent to various systems with the ability to restart ""time"" in the systems, that is to travel into the past so the virtual reality can be re-lived over and over again.

These Anunnaki came to Earth and set up control here. They are literally from the past, as they have re-started the system before. They hope to re-start it again so they can enslave all the beings of Light for another ride on the merry-go-round, and force them to drive the pointless counterfeit creation here. The Anunnaki know that they must re-start everything before 2012 A.D. because that is the date which they have set for restarting the clock.

While things were going along for the Anunnaki and they were doing their ""father's"" bidding on Earth, the Attas of Light became very active, which was most troubling to the Anunnaki.

All major religions in this world *are sponsored by the Anunnaki*. Religion is an extremely effective tool for keeping control of the people. A fundamental aspect of all these religions is that the central figure of worship is the sun, whether they called their sun god Ra, Apollo, Helios, etc. This was true in ancient Greek, Egyptian, Sumerian, Babylonian, Roman, English, Mayan, and Incan cultures, etc.

Sun worship is the basis for major religions today, even if it has been corrupted or its foundation has been obscured or lost. For instance, Jews have their ancient temples constructed to honor the sun and the Zodiac.

The most notable of these temples dedicated to sun worship would be Solomon's Temple, which was standing during the entire reign of Josiah. Josiah is remembered by Bible students for knocking down idols dedicated to the worship of the sun and other gods formerly of the Jewish pantheon. Josiah claimed to be following the *Laws of Moses*.

Yet Solomon's Temple, which was built long after the death of Moses and violated many of those laws, was left untouched. Either the *laws* of Moses were tampered with after the Temple was built to allow it to stand, or Solomon's Temple was an abomination to the Jewish faith. For whatever reasons, Josiah allowed the temple in Jerusalem to remain despite its obvious construction and dedication to sun worship.

Freemasons construct their lodges east and west and the Worshipful Master of the lodge stands in the east because, according to Masonic teachings, as the sun rises in the east, so should the Master stand in the east. Freemasons make advancements in degrees by seeking more light in Masonry. This is not to be confused with *divine light.*

Masonic teachings state that there are two lights. These lights are referred to as the greater and the lesser lights. The sun is the greater light, while the moon is the lesser.

[Basic Illuminati Structure](https://i.redd.it/yj3bsauksbt81.gif)

In Grand Master George Smith's The Use and Abuse of FreeMmsonry is found:

>The emblematical meaning of the Sun is well known to the enlightened and inquisitive Free-Mason; and as the real Sun is situated in the centre of the universe, so the emblematical Sun is the centre of real Masonry.  
   
We all know that the Sun is the fountain of light, the source of the seasons, the cause of the vicissitudes of day and night, the parent of vegetation, the friend of man; hence the scientific Free-Mason only knows the reason why the Sun is placed in the centre of this beautiful hall.

The Anunnaki *have planted sun worship throughout the world.*

They have forced the construction of structures to pay homage to the sun, such as Stonehenge, where the altar stone faces the rising sun. Even though Stonehenge was also used as an observatory and had other purposes, sun worship was its main purpose. The Anunnaki know that the sun must keep burning or the illusion of the solar system will shatter.

That is the main objective of Anunnaki's occupation of worlds - to keep the stars burning.

The Anunnaki Elite were given a particular sound by the Demiurge which allowed them to control and re-start ""time"" within solar systems. It is like the key to a huge time machine. It allows the Anunnaki to *turn back the clock*, so to speak, and gain a temporary reprieve from the Celestial Correction by the Light.

The Demiurge's sound was removed from the Earth by the Anunnaki Elite when they fled after destroying Atlantis. They took the *""word""* with them. The Attas of the Light has since blocked the Anunnaki Elite from returning to Earth.

However, *some of the Anunnaki Elite slipped through the net temporarily* and approached near enough to the Earth during the time of Solomon to transmit the sound to three chosen Anunnaki Remnants who were on Earth - King Solomon, King Hiram, and Abiff, Master Mason. The Anunnaki Elite did this desperate thing in the hope that the Anunnaki Remnants would be able to help them return and re-take control of the Earth.

This ""word"" is the powerhouse of the Demiurge. The ""word"" has the power to keep this realm in motion and keep the illusion afloat. Except for the intervention by the Amoebas/Attas of the Light, the ""word"" would continue to have this power. The following is worthy of reflection regarding the ""word"" and the ""god"" being written about in the verse.

>In the beginning was the ""word"", and the ""word"" was with *God*, and the ""word"" was *God*.

The first two syllables of the ""word"" given to King Solomon and King Hiram respectively are like the building blocks. They cannot do anything in and of themselves without the third and final syllable. Thus, the first two syllables are like drones without the ""spirit"" of the third syllable. The final syllable acts like the life force which drives the ""word"" of the Demiurge.

The third syllable was given to Abiff because the Anunnaki Elite saw him as the most pious (devoted and loyal to the Anunnaki Elite), hence he was seen as the most trustworthy of the instruments. That is why the two kings were unable to bring the FULL power of the Demiurge to the Earth. So, they commenced a frantic search, quizzing all workmen and slaves who were a part of building the temple, hoping that Abiff may have given the syllable to one of them.

This search proved fruitless.

Since then, the search continues for the lost ""word"". This search continues in many forms, with most of the searchers totally oblivious to what they are really searching for or why. Even today, many still seek the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail. Many stories were created to hide the true purpose of the ventures. There is always an attachment of some sort of spiritual quest in the scouring of the land for the ""word"". The Crusades were part of this quest.

The *Ark of the Covenant* possessed famed properties. It was in reality a ""radio"" transceiver that was used by the priests to send and receive information directly to and from their ""gods"" (the Anunnaki Elite) in the spacecraft.

These searches are all instigated and sponsored by the Anunnaki Remnants, who have first inspection rights to all finds. This is a mandatory condition of all Anunnaki Remnant-funded projects designed to search for the lost ""word"", which searches are carried out under many disguises. These searches attract many who are sincerely searching for Truth, Love, Light, and Purity.

However, many of those with admirable intentions are being fooled by the Anunnaki Remnants. The sincere seekers have no suspicion whatsoever as to the origin or agendas of the plot.  


Different groups of Anunnaki Remnants are still searching for the ""word"", performing their search in different ways, and whilst the majority of the people do not suspect this agenda, most would scoff at it. Some people can now see or sense the Anunnaki faces behind their human disguises (whether the faces are Reptilian, Vulturite, Masa-karas, and even Olcars who are the highest Reptilians, etc).

As *virtual reality collapses more and more*, so too will more and more people become aware of the Anunnaki around them.

A recent example of this desperate search by one group of the Anunnaki Remnants for the lost ""word"" occurred when Iraq was invaded in 2003. The cover story for this invasion was to rid the world of that country's storehouse of weapons of mass destruction. The most informed leaders of the invading forces knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

The apparent reason for the invasion was for control of the oil fields in the country, which is what the ruling elite wants those who see through the façade of the main cover story to think - that is that it was done for greed, oil, and money.

However, the real reason for the invasion of Iraq was to perform an intense search of the country for clues to the lost ""word"". This shows how wide, intense and desperate the search is for the ""word"". This is because the ""word"" has the power to change the destiny of the Anunnaki Elite. It could open the gates to bring them back to Earth for yet another reign of terror.

The New World Order employs agents to spread disinformation misinformation to the masses. It also tries to frighten the masses into compliance. One of its most effective tools of recent has been to implement artificial catastrophes so that draconian laws can be enacted to fight the artificial war on terrorism. This is a contrived war that got out of hand and now there are some real terrorists causing ""unplanned"" damage.

The New World Order also creates false prophets who predict things that will never transpire. These false prophets are hired to predict these non-events in order to discredit true prophets so that when the real Message is given, most people will not take it seriously.

It was intended that this story would cause mass panic and hysteria so that martial law could be enforced. However, this devious plan was thwarted by the Attas of Light, and the plan has fizzled. Yet, this is such an important plot for the New World Order that many are still desperately attempting to resurrect it.

Some of the New World Order agents play roles to appear to be scorning the false prophet, but in reality, they are conspiring and working together to try to keep this devious plot alive. It will not work. On the energy level, this failed attempt of the ruling elite is a crushing defeat for Darkness.

The *Freemasons are agents of the Reptilian Anunnaki Remnants*, and form a group that is ""openly"" secret and is very actively searching for the ""word"". Every Master Mason knows the story of Hiram Abiff and the three ruffians, and they all know the substitute word that was given at Abiff's funeral. Almost all of them are looking for this ""word"", but very few have any idea of the reason behind it.

Freemasonry was originated by Darkness. Christianity was hijacked by Darkness. Since Darkness thoroughly corrupted Christianity, it is virtually impossible to discern the difference between Freemasonry and Christianity.

There are many members of the royal families throughout the world who are involved in the Freemason society or branches thereof. These organizations are widespread but theoretically, nobody outside knows what goes on inside the lodges.

Many of the ruling elite belong to these groups. It should be stressed again, that many members of the organization have no idea of the nefarious agendas of the highest echelon of the organization. Many of them are innocent people caught in a spider's web, just like many Christians.

Many Light beings are attracted to various religions and esoteric groups even though the organizations are sponsored by the Dark side. This is because Darkness has deviously mixed Light teachings with untruth to lure and fool the unaware True-Light beings who are attracted to the Truth that is buried in the maze of untruth. Some of these mixtures are so complex and well disguised that even highly advanced beings have difficulty sorting the gems from the garbage.

*Things are not always what they appear to be* in this world of virtual reality. Neither are the Freemasons what they appear to be, even to the majority of their members.

Native American Hopis have a legend about ""The Sign From the West"" being the forerunner of the end of Evil.

The *Sign From the West* is now in the physical realm. The *Sign From the West* bears the esoteric message to look to the West instead of the East. As the rising sun symbolizes the heart of Evil, the setting sun represents the end of Evil. It is time to abandon the worship of the sun - time to abandon Evil.

The Lakota Native Americans have a legend about the births of white buffalo calves. When seven are born, the Teacher known as the White Buffalo Woman will appear, which will signal the end of Evil and the return to Purity. The seventh white buffalo was born, but not in a bison's body.

The White Buffalo Woman has returned to Earth, not as the Teacher, but as the Liberator of True-Light beings trapped in Darkness, whether they are in mineral, vegetable, animal, human or other bodies and whether they are devas of rivers or seas, plains or mountains, etc. including even the ""soul"" of the Earth.

The true *God* does not want to be worshipped. In fact, the desire to be worshipped is yet another Anunnaki trait. The Anunnaki also build huge, elaborate monuments and temples, but these are not for the true *God*. These are human-made idols to satisfy the human ego.

The Light has attempted repeatedly to correct Darkness and bring It back to the Light, but Darkness stubbornly rejects any correction. Darkness has tenaciously held onto every True-Light being that is trapped in the virtual reality and holds those beings ransom.

Now, the time has come for the Light to liberate Its Own from Darkness.

The process has commenced.",conspiracy,Zodiac

(probably shouldn't, i have gathered lol), and one of the first few results was a yahoo answers link with my same question. 


But the top answer was this (as is, with no paragraphs): 

*""Gov't is killing you with high frequency electricity.Theotokos Virgin Mary gave prayers to ""Schema-nun Antonia"" on how to save aborted babies from hell. If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are 40 demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on 7 meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for 1 year = 5 aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of tight pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell for until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chipped using IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs; stay away from cats [Afanasiy Sidyachiy]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (hemisphere); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7525 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: ""Christ is here; Christ is there"" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He's surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flour from mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm) because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign of the cross (last mercy for you will be to cut your forearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't using chemtrails; they're also in gov't food and medicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of aborted fetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human flesh is in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging, anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-12 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse, Chrtistians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos Virgin Mary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Green 666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (World Passport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyes scan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. Gabriel Urgebadze said that they do it on index finger when they scan your finger. Basically, try to avoid new documents at all cost. Police will microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, green mark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotope ray people too. Antichrist will also release prisoners to mark people. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with Orthodox Christians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can't track you; burn documents because they're from Satan. The Most Holy Trinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. Social Security Number). People who die with these Satanic documents go to concentration camp in hell to await Final Judgement; once the BEAST Computer is burned down, souls will be released for Final Judgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceased relatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristian names given during antibaptism by the beast system; or just burn these documents because gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from half a millenium ago describes Final Judgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had little boards (plastic cards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from temporary hell twice a year [at midnight between September 18 and September 19 and similarly on November 20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding ""and relatives by flesh up to Adam"") so that they are rescued if they're in hell] (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons; when pigeons bow down, people are saved from temporary hell. It's a big sin to remember the dead with wreaths (because demons put these wreaths on their necks if they're in hell with their hands tied up behind their back while hanging by their hands), meat, alcohol, sweets, and worldly music. Demons print icons of saints in newspapers so that you throw these newspapers in the trash blaspheming these saints. Crosses on soles of shoes and back of pants are blasphemy. Demons make carpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walk on crosses. Playing cards mock how Jesus suffered on the cross: clubs (cross on which Jesus was crucified), diamonds (four nails Jesus was crucified with), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesus was given to drink),spades (spear with which Jesus was pierced).Cremation is devil worship; only blasphemers such as Lenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this.After China attacks Russia, Ruski Orthodox Tsar (shown by resurrected Seraphim of Sarov) will come to power in Russia;this Tsar will slay traitors inside church and gov't; as a result, Russia will be the only country not under the antichrist.Ecumenism = 263 heresies;each heresy leads to hell. In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink),representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same Supreme Being [aka the devil]. Priests who participate in ecumenism will have Pagans walking on their heads in hell. Arkhimandrite Antonin Kapustin left a prophecy that John the Baptist's living space will become a church and it will be blessed by forerunner of antichrist; Patriarch Kirill of Russia blessed this church.When priests pray for current gov't (instead of praying for future Tsar),Jesus gets up from His throne and turns His back to them. Forgive me.""*

Now with links and art:

The ritual killing lasted 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Numerically, the digits add up to 18, which is 6+6+6.

The ritual occurred on [‪East 38th Street‬, which is on the same street as the “Prince Hall Grand Lodge”, 1/2 mile away.](https://imgur.com/eXRScjJ) This is a Masonic Lodge for black people. George Floyd’s family hired “Benjamin Crump”, as their lawyer, [who is listed as a famous Prince Hall Freemason.](https://imgur.com/N4O444Z) George Floyd’s twin friend, ex-NBA player Stephen Jackson [is also connected to the Masonic fraternity.](https://imgur.com/fnrVgWj) 

The riots began on ‪East 33rd Street‬, [next to garbage-can with 666 painted on it.](https://imgur.com/0eo2L0v) This was in the city of ‪Minneapolis, Minnesota‬, which has the same acronym “MM” as “Master Mason”. If you flip MM sideways you get 33, [the highest degree in the Scottish rite of Freemasonry.](http://www.knightstemplarorder.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Structure-of-Freemasonry-1956-Templar-Closeup-1250-JPG-500x367.jpg) 33 is the age Jesus died. 33 reduces to 6.

In the 3rd degree of [Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry), Masons are introduced to a character called [Hiram Abiff.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_Abiff) In Masonic lore, [Hiram Abiff is the builder of Solomon’s temple](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/St_John%27s_Church%2C_Chester_-_Hiram-Fenster_2.jpg), and is nicknamed the “Widow’s Son”. All Freemasons are designated as “Sons of the Widow”. In Masonic lore, Hiram Abiff is murdered by three ruffians. This ritual is acted out by Master Masons, which involves staging the murder of a candidate.

During his arrest, [three police officers (three ruffians) kneeled](https://imgur.com/ywhBiYd) on George Floyd’s body, while he was gasping for air. Derek Chauvin, the police officer, who took the blame for Floyd’s death, was originally charged with third-degree murder – fitting for a third-degree Masonic ritual. At one point, Derek Chauvin and Floyd were working security at the same night club. [I suspect Derek Chauvin is a fake-name](https://imgur.com/Pi9B6Vj), and that he is a crisis actor, who may have been used in other False Flags events. [Photographs have surfaced with an identical man at the boston marathon bombing](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EZJVgxhVcAEbfeo?format=jpg&name=small). The reality of crisis actors is validated and irrefutable. People have been tried and convicted for inciting violence at major events and in their testimony confessed to coercion with govt and intelligence agencies. An important cultural event such as the George Floyd death would absolutely warrant foul play. The cop shown in the viral video went missing for weeks after the incident and his neighbors never saw him in a police uniform.

The ritual occurred on Memorial Day, which honors those killed defending our country. During Masonic rituals, Masons kneel before the grave of Hiram Abiff, as a ‘memorial’. At George Floyd’s funeral, [many kneeled before his golden casket.](https://imgur.com/gvu1I68) In solidarity with the BLM protests, Nancy Pelosi, alongside fellow Democrats, wore African kente cloth, and kneeled – 8 minutes and 46 seconds – at the capitol. 

The name “George” means “farmer” or “earth-worker”. This gives us a clue – as to his symbolic identity. George Floyd was cast in the role of Hiram Abiff, who represents Osiris. [Osiris was the Egyptian god of fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris), vegetation, and the cycles of nature. In ancient Egypt, agriculture depended on its summer floods, which fertilized the land. Perhaps this is why George Floyd pleaded for water, not because he was thirsty. According to Egyptian legends, Osiris was murdered by Set, the god of Chaos. The number eight represents chaos magick. After the ritual was completed, the world experienced total mayhem. All of the looting, rioting, and anarchy were done in the name of the widow’s son George Floyd. 

According to certain Egyptian legends, [Osiris died while being locked in a golden casket.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth) This represents the death of the Sun. Osiris is the Black Sun or ‪Midnight Sun.‬ This is in contrast, to Horus the Risen Sun, Ra the Noonday Sun, and Set – the Setting Sun. 

Celebrities who obsess with gold or covering themselves in gold are emulating gods. It is said that gold is the flesh of gods.

During his death speech, George Floyd said “I can’t breathe” 12 times (solar number). He also cried out to his mama, who had been dead for two years. Masons, however, have a grand hailing sign of distress – and may plead with their brethren by asking: [“Is there no help for the widow’s son?”](https://jacobprimo.blogspot.com/2005/12/is-there-no-help-for-widows-son.html) George Floyd was calling out to Isis – the goddess of the mysteries, who became a widow upon the death of Osiris.

In his final minutes, George Floyd tells the policemen he is “claustrophobic”, which is strange under his circumstances, but not for someone being locked in a casket. The autopsy revealed, George Floyd died of asphyxiation or suffocation. 

Similar to the sun god Osiris, George Floyd was buried in a golden casket. [His body was transported by a horse-drawn carriage,](https://imgur.com/Fp4Oz7l) which is another solar symbol – as [solar deities are often depicted riding a chariot across the skies.](https://d2wpnc0srowh1f.cloudfront.net/Mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/800px-Costantino_Cedini_Aurora_with_Apollo_Driving_the_Sun_Chariot.jpg)

Floyd Mayweather is paying for all four of his funerals, which are in Minneapolis (North), Houston (South), Charlotte (East), and the fourth to be announced (West?). “Floyd”, “May” and “Weather” in his name – would bankroll four funerals. The symbolism here – alludes to the four cardinal points and the four seasons in the solar year. 2020 also reduces to 4.

George Floyd’s final resting spot is Pearland, which is symbolic of Upper Egypt – the kingdom of Set, the god of Chaos. [The scorpion macehead or scepter of Upper Egypt](http://www.ancient-egypt.org/history/early-dynastic-period/1st-dynasty/horus-narmer/narmer-artefacts/scorpion-macehead.html) [was pear-shaped](http://www.ancient-egypt.org/_Media/scorpion-macehead_med_hr.png). The pear belongs to a family of fruit, which includes the Quince, a golden fruit—that is said to be the forbidden fruit of Eden – that leads to gnosis. 

In his death speech, George Floyd mentions five body parts that hurt – his face, neck, nuts, knees, and stomach. The Freemasons do a ritual that involves five-points of fellowship – which are the face, foot, knee, breast, and back. While Masons probably don’t grab each other’s testicles, the word “big feet” is a euphemism for being well-endowed, so the “foot” and “sexual organs” are linked. That being said, Freemasons have some liberty as to where they touch each other, the key here – is that there are five points of contact. 

As previously discussed, eight represents “chaos magick”. In Chaldean numerology, the number 46 represents the [crown chakra](https://chakracenter.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/crown-chakra.jpg). Considering, the word “corona” means “crown” – this fits perfectly. [George Floyd not only got photographed standing by a corona beer poster](https://imgur.com/CpTC6QZ), but he also tested positive for coronavirus. From an astrological perspective, we are entering into the Age of Aquarius, an air sign, explaining the attack on our minds. CORONA = CROWN = MIND.

The number 846 refers to ‪8:46 pm‬, [the time of the sunset at Minneapolis on May 25th.](https://imgur.com/PUWZJQB) Allegorically, this is when Osiris is killed by Set. The attack on the Twin Towers began ‪at 8:46 am‬. Since Minneapolis, along with St. Paul – make up the twin cities, this connects the two rituals. This gives us twin towers, twin cities, and twin brothers.

9/11/2001 and 5/25/2020 are *6831 days apart.

6 + 8 + 3 + 1 = 18 • 6 + 6 + 6 = 18

Every day at sunset, the sun is allegorically killed – and descends into the underworld – the world of chaos. This is the domain of the black-sun Osiris. George Floyd represents “Osiris”. [He has the Masonic “Ordo Ab Chao"" tattooed on his chest](https://imgur.com/dKJCuuo). This is Latin for [“Order out of Chaos”](http://www.masonicdictionary.com/ordoabchao.html). Which is the foundation of American Military Mind Control Complex and the immediate aftermath of these riots. Immediate Military Order from the Chaos.

The ritual was recorded from the Dragon Wok restaurant while “Scorpio” was rising on the Eastern horizon. Allegorically, the Sun is killed each day by Scorpio, which is depicted as a “scorpion, dragon, or serpent”. It is also the “serpent” that tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit – the Quince – which is called Pyrus Cydonia.

Another major event will be the [Ring of Fire](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SNXULTHzCKGssTvirKVjz8-650-80.jpg) at the summer solstice. The summer solstice is the climax of the sun’s journey north – to the tropic of Cancer, which involves maximum light. [This year, the Sun and the Moon will be united at the summer solstice](https://www.space.com/eclipse-season-2020-has-begun.html), in the zodiac sign of Cancer, making a ring of fire. This is a rare event. Some consider this a bad omen, as the eclipse will darken the “longest day of the year”. Esoterically, eclipses represent a celestial marriage, as the sun and moon are united, which creates a perfect balance of masculine and feminine energies. The child born of this alchemical wedding will become manifested in the first full moon of summer – which is the Buck Moon ‪on July 5th.‬",conspiracy,Zodiac

CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE 

The seven days of creation are generations of gods


Abzu is Fresh Water
Tiamat (Also Nammu) is a Dragon Lizard Goddess, Salt Water. 
They had kids.
Lahmu
Lahamu 
These guys represent the zodiac and constellations.
They had kids.
Anshar, Whole Heaven. God.
Kishar, Whole Earth. Gaia.
They meet at the horizon (Fuck) and Anu and Ninhursag (Ki) are born.
Anu and Ki farther the Anunnaki, most importantly Enki and Enil.

List of Anunnaki:

An, Enlil, Enki, Ninhursag, Nanna, Utu, and Inanna

These made the Igigu, slave race that preceded humans.

Enki and Ninhursag 


Kids:
Ninsar (Goddess of Greenery), Enki then, not knowing she is his daughter, fucks her.
Ninsar gives birth to Ninkurra (Goddess of Fruitfulness), Enki then fucks Ninkurra who gives birth to Uttu ( Weaver of The web of life), Uttu hides from Enki but he gets her drunk with Beer and rapes her. Ninhursag turns up and removes the semen from Uttu and plants it which grows into 8 plants that Enki later eats.
He becomes ill because of this and proceeds to be sick / ejaculate into Ninhursag’s mouth where she gives birth to gods of healing, Abu for the Jaw, Nintul for the Hip, Ninsutu for the tooth, Ninkasi for the mouth, Dazimua for the side, Enshagag for the Limbs. The last one, Ninti (Lady Rib), is also a pun on Lady Life, a title of Ninhursag herself. The story thus symbolically reflects the way in which life is brought forth through the addition of water to the land, and once it grows, water is required to bring plants to fruit. It also counsels balance and responsibility, nothing to excess.

CREATION OF MAN

These guys pissed of Tiamat at some point and Abzu could not change her mind on the idea of killing the younger gods. Mummu is bought in to discuss the idea and ends up agreeing that the younger gods should be killed. Enki hears about this and casts a spell sending Abzu to sleep.
He then killed Abzu, took Abzu’s Halo and wore it whilst chaining up Mummu.
Enki then takes the place (Abzul’s palace in Iraq) as his own with Ninhursag as his queen. Marduk is then created in this domain who is more powerful than Enki. Anu create 4 winds?



 
At some point the offspring of Abzu killed him. The other gods of this tier said to Tiamat that she did nothing to stop this death. She hired a lizard general called Kingu and gave him Abzuls “The Tablet of Destinies” which resulted in Tiamat making dragons “filled with venom and not blood” to fight the lower class of gods, Enki and anu were scared of the monsters Tiamat had created! until Marduk Enkis son was summoned he feared no woman and killed the monsters and Tiamat. Her body is this reality. Marduk gives the sky to Anu, the land to Enki and the air between to Enil. The monsters were turned into statues.

Marduk then writes the likenesses of the gods in the skies making the constellations, the zodiac signs and defines the amount of days in a year. The clouds are made and this creates the Tigris and Euphrates (biggest rivers in Iraq).

Kingu is sacrificed and his blood is used to create man. Enki is initially against this although eventually comes around.

600 gods are assigned to the over world and 300 assigned to the underworld.

Marduk then commission Babylon and a temple and throne are built for him, Esagila.

Marduk, Enki and Enil live there.

Marduk goes on to replace Enil.

Man is created out of all the gods spit, the blood of Kingu and clay and after 10 months the specially made womb breaks open and humans are born. 

Overpopulation of humans leads to a famine being sent every 1200 years.
Enil is bad.
Enki is good.
Enil decides the whole thing is too much hassle and begins to plan the destruction of humanity whilst Enki is sworn to secrecy.

Genesis 6 States that man were given 120 years, that the men of gods had children with human women and they bore hero’s onto the world. The lord Enil was pissed at how un-compassionate humans had become and regretted their creation. It states that as female humans were beginning to increase in number the sons of god married any they chose.

Enki tells Utnapishtim / Atrahasis / Noah that Enil is going to flood the world and he must rip down his house and make a boat and fill it with animals and his family to preserve life. The flood comes. 7 days pass. The boat gets stuck on top of Pir Omar Gudrun and the Gods Enki, Enil, Inanna and Ninurta descend from Anu and Enil looses his shit at Enki, Enki reminds Enil of the need for compassion and  Utnapishtim / Atrahasis his made a god, granted immortality and moved to a house at the rivers mouth.

Utnapishtim / Atrahasis appears again in the Epic of Gilgamesh where he recounts the story to Gilgamesh who is on the path for immortality. He states to Gilgamesh that immortality was a gift for preserving life and that of Gilgamesh wanted to attempt the same feat he should try and conquer sleep. He fails at the first hurdle and falls asleep. As he is leaving Utnapishtim / Atrahasis’s his wife says that he should leave Gilgamesh with a parting gift. He is told of a plant at the bottom of the sea which will make him younger. He retrieved it and whilst he is bathing on the shore after coming out the ocean a snake steals it.

He returns back to his home town defeated but the walls of the city remind him that this is how humanity live forever.


Enki fucks up by having a drinking competition with his daughter È-Anna and whilst inebriated gives her the gifts of gods (Mes) that we’re collected by Enil and given to Enki to distribute out to the humans at different city centers. These included:

I'm not even going to get into the political/pure propaganda(such as virtue signaling in commercials etc) side of things though. I've been awake for a very long time and just want to throw a few things out here that I've noticed:

A few channels are having advertisements for out of season Halloween night-esque movie specials. I love horror books and movies, but these particular ads seems to be just compilations of *very* gory or creepy jump scenes with a narrator over it. I just never see that level of violence in commercials. 

Main thing is all of a sudden I'm noticing alot of channels running morbid themes marathons. Some channels, multie at a time, were running full day serial killer docs and miniseries. Which I love btw, I'm just saying that usually I seek out that kind of stuff from youtubers like Jim C.Swim because TV rarely covers it, or when it does - just skimming the surface of a case. 
Biggest thing im referencing is stuff like 1984(with michael douglas), Se7en, Zodiac,Kalifornia etc. Ik Silence of the Lambs comes on a lot, but It seems like it's been coming on extremely frequently. 

I'm just saying that if you just *graze* over the details of the recent shooting up in BC, it screams psyop. Obviously they've shown in order to cut back **hard** on freedoms such as gun rights all a govt needs is a shooting.  Idk. Maybe this is my sleep deficit talking. I honestly dont really care.

The New Testament is probably the most read book in the world. And yet it is also a mysterious book and, at best, not completely and fully understood. In some cases, this is because what churches teach today no longer matches what the New Testament says. This is the case with the nature and person of Jesus. In other cases, it is not so much that the teaching has been changed as that it has been completely lost.

This is true of the early Christian view of cosmology. It is peppered throughout the New Testament, but it has been completely forgotten or forgotten. The result is that many parts of the text are confusing or incomprehensible today.

Here is an example – angels. Today, angels are golden-haired beauties who save you from car accidents. In the United States, there is even a magazine, Angels on Earth, which is dedicated to printing readers' first-hand experiences of encounters with angels. It has a circulation of hundreds of thousands.

But in the first century CE it was not so. Here is a curious fact: in the New Testament, the apostle Paul never speaks favorably of angels. Examples: “For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come… will be able to separate us from the love of God” (Romans 8: 38–39; Biblical quotations are from the Authorized King James Version). “For I believe that God presented the apostles to us last, as destined for death; for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels and to men” (1 Corinthians 4:9; emphasis added in both passages).

&#x200B;

In both examples, angels are not friends of humanity, but barriers to God.

To understand the implications of this fact, it may be best to start with the cosmological worldview that was current in the first century CE. It is based on the seven planets known at the time: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. They were believed to revolve around the Earth (in the order just given), each in its own crystalline sphere. Beyond them was the realm of the fixed stars, and beyond that, God himself.

Another curious fact: you will notice that in English the word heaven has two meanings, one related to the physical heaven (usually in the plural heavens) and the other to the spiritual realm. The ancient Greek word ouranos had a similar double meaning. The heavens above, including the spheres of the planets, were considered to be both physical space and the spiritual dimension.

It is difficult for us today to understand this worldview. Although we think of heaven in the spiritual sense as being ""up there,"" we understand this only as a metaphor. The realms of physical planets and stars in outer space, to our minds, have no spiritual component as such.

In antiquity it was not so. The physical heavens were identified with the levels through which the soul had to ascend after death. These levels, and the planets associated with them, were often seen as a series of gates that blocked the soul from its ascension to its true home.

&#x200B;

Each of these planets had a vice associated with it, which is where we get the concept of the seven deadly sins from. The soul could only ascend if it got rid of these vices. The process is described in the Poimandres, a treatise that forms part of the Corpus Hermeticum or “hermetic body” of writings, generally dating from the first centuries of the Common Era:

The human being ascends through the cosmic structure, in the first zone \[the moon\] delivering the energy of increase and decrease; in the second evil machination \[Mercury\], a device now inactive; in the third \[Venus\] the illusion of longing, now inactive; in the fourth \[the sun\] the arrogance of the ruler, now inactive; in the fifth \[Mars\] unholy presumption and bold daring; in the sixth \[Jupiter\] the evil impulses that come from wealth, now inactive; and on the seventh \[Saturn\] the deception that is in the ambush. (Poimandres, 1.25)

Each of these seven spheres was also ruled by a planetary archon, who could be seen as either an angel or a god.

&#x200B;

Heavenly Realms and Corrupted Forces of Evil

Another part of Christian teaching – and again, I'm talking about the New Testament – ​​was that these planetary spheres were ruled by corrupt forces. The Epistle to the Ephesians, according to most scholars, was not written by Paul, but is close to his thought. Here is what is written:

“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in \[heavenly\] places” (Ephesians 6:12).

The word ""heavenly"" in this version appears on a note. But it is closer to the Greek epouraníois than the reading in the main text, ""high places"". This verse makes it clear that the “principalities” and “powers” ​​were not the Roman emperors, but the spiritual forces of evil. Paul himself in Romans 8:38-39 (quoted above), uses more or less identical terms in the same way.

Fast-forward five hundred years to the most important work on angelology in the Christian tradition: the Celestial Hierarchy of Dionysus the Areopagite. (Dionysius the Areopagite is a figure mentioned in Acts 17:34 as a contemporary of Paul. This work is attributed to him, but most likely was written 500 years later, in the 6th century CE. Therefore, the author otherwise unknown, is often called ""Pseudo-Dionysus."") He lists orders, or ""choirs"" of angels, each class having a different name. Two of them are the “Principles” and “Powers”. The Pseudo-Dionysian system was taken up by Dante in his Divine Comedy, among others.

Note the change here. For Paul and the author of Ephesians, writing in the first century, ""principalities"" and ""powers"" are among the forces of ""iniquity in heavenly places."" For Pseudo-Dionysius, writing five hundred years later, they are honored members of the celestial hierarchy.

It would be a complicated task to show when and how this change took place. For our purposes, it's enough to know that he made it happen. Thus, the dominant Christian view of angels as one-sidedly benevolent simply does not go back to the early days of the faith.

The upshot of all this is that among the early Christians, at least among those who wrote the New Testament, there was a widespread belief that the heavenly realms were occupied by forces of evil. The Christian's struggle was to rise above them, fight with them, and possibly defeat them.

This is also a theme that appears throughout the New Testament. In Luke 10:18, we find a mysterious verse. It appears in this context: Jesus sent seventy disciples to preach his message. They return “with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us through your name.” Jesus replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.”

&#x200B;

A similar idea appears in John 12:31: “Now is the judgment of this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out.”

&#x200B;

The result of all these details is clear: the early Christians - anyway, those who wrote the New Testament - believed that somehow Satan and the forces of spiritual evil managed to take shelter in the heavenly spheres and that this was the task of Christ (and his followers) to overthrow them. The verse from Luke quoted above sounds as if this has already happened: the verses from Paul suggest that the struggle is still going on.

&#x200B;

The Book of Revelation

To understand this picture more fully, we will have to turn to the most enigmatic book in the Bible: Revelation.

The Apocalypse dominates the Western imagination like no other work. In Doctor Zhivago, Boris Pasternak wrote: ""All great genuine art resembles and continues the Revelation of Saint John."" Its images and themes have long delved into the popular imagination: the Beast, the Whore of Babylon, the number 666, the Four Horsemen. However, very few have managed to piece together their narrative and explain it in terms that could make sense to their original audience in the first century CE.

But it is possible to do this in light of the ideas I outlined above.

To begin with, a brief outline of this enigmatic book: John – traditionally associated with the “beloved disciple” of \[Christ\] Jesus, although he probably did not write it – has a vision of the “Son of man” among seven golden candlesticks, representing seven churches, all of them in Asia Minor. The messages are unenthusiastic at best: to the one in Ephesus, for example, he says, “I have one thing against you, because you have left your first love” (Revelation 2:4).

Then John has a vision of heaven, where he sees ""seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God."" A book with seven seals is presented, and these seals are opened, each revealing some new and terrible manifestation: the famous Four Horsemen, ""a great earthquake"" and a cosmic cataclysm: ""The stars of heaven fell to the earth... heaven split like a scroll when it was rolled up” (Revelation 6:12–14).

When these are completed, seven angels blow seven trumpets, with similar tribulations: a star called Wormwood falls on the waters of the earth, ""and the third part of the waters became wormwood: and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter"" (Revelation 8:11).

&#x200B;

Finally, the culminating moment arrives:

“And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon: and the dragon and his angels fought, And they did not prevail; nor was their place found any longer in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him” (Revelation 12:7-9).

&#x200B;

The images of Revelation were used so often and in so many ways that certain facts were obscured. First, the vision is not about some imagined end of the world in an immeasurably remote future. It is something the prophet sees as happening in his own time.

Secondly, we may wonder why the number seven is repeated and emphasized to an almost manic degree. In light of the things we've already seen, the reason becomes clearer: it has to do with the realms of the seven planets. They were inhabited by corrupt forces, including evil angels. The opening of the seven seals and the sounding of the seven trumpets culminate in a war in which all of them, led by Satan, are thrown from heaven to earth.

Revelation appears to be describing a great cleansing of the cosmic realms which, the prophet believes, was initiated by Christ, ""the Son of man,"" ""the Lamb."" Satan is cast to Earth. (Remember the line in Luke where Jesus says he sees Satan falling “like lightning” from heaven.)

At this point, the action switches to Earth. Then follows ""the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters."" She sits on ""a scarlet colored beast... with seven heads"". The text explains, “The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits” (Revelation 17:3, 9). The identification of this woman and beast is obvious: it is Rome, which was built on seven hills. It has “seven kings. Five have already fallen, one is and the other has not yet arrived; and when he comes, he must continue for a short time.” If we identify them with the Roman emperors, the first five are Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, who was deposed in 68. By this calculation, Galba would be the sixth, although he reigned only seven months. This brings us to 69 CE, known as “the year of the four emperors,” because, in fact, four emperors followed in quick succession. The prophet believes that there will be another, but that his reign will be brief and that he will be the last. John was partially right: the reign of Otho, who succeeded Galba, lasted only three months. But he was far from the last emperor.

If this is indeed what John has in mind, we find ourselves in the midst of the Jewish War (66-73 CE), in which the Jews revolted against Rome. It seems likely that the prophet is writing about this time, and he hopes this will usher in the Last Judgment, which will involve a final battle with the result that “Babylon the great has fallen” (Revelation 18:2). After that, the prophet sees “a new heaven and a new earth, and the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God” (Revelation 21:1–2).

This did not happened. Instead, the Jews were crushed by Titus Vespasian. The Temple in Jerusalem was sacked and Judea partially depopulated. Rome, the “great harlot,” was not overthrown and heavenly forces did not descend to destroy her. The Roman Empire continued to last for centuries. The Last Judgment did not occur. Not even the world ended.

In any case, we can summarize the action of Revelation as follows: Christ the Lamb is slain and risen. He ascends to heaven and purifies the seven heavens of evil influences, led by Satan. They are cast down to Earth and are incorporated into the Roman Empire, which will be crushed by the heavenly forces led by the Lamb \[Christ\], culminating in a new world.

The Host of Heaven

I cannot claim to understand all the symbolism of Revelation, which is profound and multifaceted, but I am willing to say that this is, at least in part, what is happening here. The evidence we have seen in other New Testament texts indicates that this belief was current, if not universal, among early Christians – at least those who wrote the New Testament.

I must also admit that this account leaves an important question unanswered. Why and how were the heavenly realms infested with evil influences?

An answer appears in the passage from the Poimandres I quoted above. Here, planetary zones seem to be identified with evil propensities. Could the Hermetic texts – of which the Poimandres is a part – be the sources of this doctrine of “spiritual wickedness in heavenly places”? Or could the texts and this doctrine have come out of the same stream?

It's possible. Although the Hermetic texts have been studied, often intensively, over the centuries, much remains baffling about them. But it is probably correct to say, along with scholar Brian Copenhaver, that they “can be understood as responses to the same medium, the very complex Greco-Egyptian culture of Ptolemaic, Roman and early Christian times” – meaning the long period between the fourth century BCE and the second century CE. This was also the medium in which Christianity emerged. Therefore, there may be some trace of these Greco-Egyptian influences in New Testament Christianity.

The Poimandres do not portray these cosmic forces as evil. When cosmic man is created, the seven ""rulers"" - that is, of the planets - are said to have ""loved man, and each gave a part of his own order."" But man, like Narcissus, fell in love with his image in the natural world and fell in love. Thus his nature is twofold: immortal, a God-given soul, and mortal, born of his passion for matter. He is enslaved by things he should master. The qualities that the “governors” gave him become vices that he has to overcome.

There are hints of similar ideas in the Hebrew Bible. Again and again we encounter entities called ""the host of heaven"" or ""the children of God."" Here's an example. The prophet Micaiah says, “I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right and on his left” (1 Kings 22:19). In this passage, the hosts of heaven are part of Yahweh's heavenly court and therefore part of the cosmic order.

But here's another verse. It is a warning given to the children of Israel by Moses: “lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, you must be led to worship and serve them.” them, which the Lord your God has distributed to all the nations under the whole heaven” (Deuteronomy 4:9).

In fact, many references in the Hebrew Bible to “the host of heaven” amount to warnings against worshiping them, or condemnations for doing so.

Heaven's host plays an ambiguous role in the Hebrew Bible. Again, these beings – personifications of the stars and planets and zodiac signs – are not necessarily evil; they are part of the heavenly court. At the same time, there is a strong temptation to worship them, which is repeatedly and vehemently denounced. As in the Poimandres, man is not to worship the seven heavenly “governors” or be subject to them.

The ascension portrayed in the Poimandres has to do with the fate of the soul after death. The ascent through the spheres happens to the virtuous, those who obey this divine dictum: “May he \[who\] is attentive recognize that he is immortal, that desire is the cause of death, and may he recognize all that exists.” (The insertion in square brackets is by the translator.) Salvation here comes from gnosis \[wisdom, knowledge\]: the insight into one's own nature and true state. He who lacks such discernment, ""he who loved the body that came from the error of desire continues in darkness, wandering, sensibly suffering the effects of death.""

&#x200B;

Initiation and Gnosis: Free from Fate

There is another topic we need to address at this point. Bulgarian sage Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov notes that the message of the Apocalypse is “a description of the elements and processes that are common to our own inner life and the life of the cosmos.” These processes of our “inner life” have to do with initiation. As they say, initiation is a kind of death and rebirth. At the simplest level, this has to do with death to the former life and birth into a new, higher life. But there's more to it than that. In a famous passage, Cicero, the great Roman statesman and philosopher, writes of initiations into the mysteries: “Therefore, verily, we learn from them the beginnings of life, and we gain the power not only to live happily, but also to die with a better hope” (Cicero, Laws 2.14.36; emphasis mine).

This theme keeps popping up around ancient mysteries. They have to do with death, not just in a symbolic sense, but in a highly practical sense. Somehow they prepare the candidate for death. They are intended to make the process he goes through in the afterlife easier and more sure of success. It seems likely to me that the Pagan Mysteries had something to do with this process. The Mithras Mysteries actually took place in seven stages of initiation, which were most likely connected to the seven planets.

We then return to the epigraph of this article, a quote from Excerpta and Theodotus (“Excerpts from Theodotus”, a Gnostic figure from the second century CE): “Until baptism … fate is valid. But then astrologers are no longer correct. “Christian baptism, viewed esoterically, elevates the candidate beyond the levels of the seven planets, which govern destiny. The initiate is free from the influence of the planets and therefore from fate.

This passage also emphasizes that liberation is not merely due to a rite, but is the result of gnosis: “It is not just purification that is liberating, but the knowledge \[gnosis\] of who we were, and what we have become, where we where we went, or where we were cast, where we hasten, from what do we purify ourselves, what is birth, and what is rebirth” (Excerpta and Theodoto, 78; my translation).

Thus, for at least some of the early Christians, baptism was correlated with a liberating ascent through the realms of the planets, whose associated vices were rendered inoperative by the sacrament. The initiate reaches a level of consciousness and being that is above the realm of the planets.

Certainly, much of this teaching has been lost or obscured over the centuries, to the point where a typical Christian today is unlikely to recognize it as part of their own religion. The view of planetary spheres as benign – indeed, as levels of the sky, as in Dante's Paradiso – has completely supplanted this older view.

And yet the echoes continue to resonate. In the early 20th century, Theosophist James M. Pryse wrote The Apocalypse Unsealed:

Many actors apparently play their roles in the Apocalypse drama; however, in reality, there is only one executor – the neophyte himself, the sacrificial “Lamb”, who awakens all the dormant forces of his inner nature, undergoes the terrible ordeals of the purifying discipline and the telesic \[i.e. initiatory\] works, and finally emerges as the Conqueror, the self-improved Man who regained his position among the immortal gods.

&#x200B;

[Theosophist James M. Pryse, author of The Apocalypse Unsealed, connects the seven seals with the chakras, the seven subtle centers of the human body. According to certain theories, they need to be opened for the seeker to achieve enlightenment. Hence he translates the Greek apokálypsis \(generally translated as “revelation”\) as initiation.](https://preview.redd.it/jpovugui8ky91.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=094957b2d454cf572f93aac46c26ac4b2f1bd750)

Pryse connects the seven seals with the seven chakras, the seven subtle centers of the human body. According to certain theories, they need to be opened for the seeker to achieve enlightenment. Hence he translates the Greek ἀποκάλυψις apokálypsis (generally translated “revelation”) as initiation.

&#x200B;

Air Tolls for the Soul

One question remains: did any fragment of this early teaching survive in later Christianity? Yes, it was – in a curious way. Eastern Orthodox teaching refers to ""aerial tolls"" that the soul must pass as it ascends after death.

Seraphim Rose, a twentieth-century American Orthodox monk, writes, “The particular place that demons dwell in this fallen world, and the place where the souls of recently departed men find them—is the air” (Rose’s emphasis). He quotes a liturgy written by John Damascene in the eighth century: “When my soul is about to be freed from the bond with the flesh, intercede for me, O Sovereign Lady \[i.e. the Virgin\] … that I may pass unhindered the princes of darkness hovering in the air. ”

And the strange metaphor of air tolls is actually used. Another passage from John Damascene: ""O Virgin, at the hour of my death, rescue me from the hands of devils, and from judgment, and from accusation, and from terrible ordeal, and from the bitter toll-houses."" At each toll road, the soul is presented with all the sins it has committed of that kind: lying, envy, fornication, and so on. If found guilty of any of these sins, he is thrown into hell. If you are innocent, you are allowed to ascend.

These ideas clearly go back a long way. A nineteenth-century historian of Orthodox theology, Metropolitan Macarius of Moscow, writes: “Such uninterrupted, constant, and universal use in the Church of the teaching of the toll houses, especially among the teachers of the fourth century, indisputably attests that it was transmitted to them by the teachers of previous centuries and is based on apostolic tradition”.

The similarity between these ideas and those of the Poimandres is striking. Other parallels can be cited, such as the seven hekhalot (palaces) of heaven mentioned at the beginning of Kabbalah.

It would be foolish, I think, to try to argue that all these teachings are exactly the same, or were so in antiquity. Then, as now, there was an array of religions, beliefs, and cults, and it would be pointless to try to show that their teachings were identical. However, the similarities are unmistakable.

Looking from a broader perspective, we can see the theme of man trying to locate himself in the cosmos. He looks up to the sky and sees the stars and planets and feels some connection with them. What kind of connection? Are these entities hostile, beneficial, indifferent? Do they lead to God or block the way? And what about the unseen realms that, however dimly, each of us knows exist?

&#x200B;

The questions multiply. The image of the seven planetary kingdoms no longer fits well with what we know of astronomy, but one cannot help feeling that it remains profoundly valid. We may have to wait until death – or initiation – to discover the truth.",conspiracy,Zodiac

Quick facts to highlight:

\- 2nd closest planet to the Sun. (Remember 2nd Seal of Illuminati. Also, the number 11=> 1+1=2.

\- Venus is the hottest planet. (Fire is the devil's friend)

\- Bylonians understood that the Evening Star and Morning Star were a single object, referred to in the tablet as the ""bright queen of the sky"".

**Music**

Now, let's take a look at some bands and songs. First we will focus on **Venus.**

Take a look at songs and lyrics. So much to discuss but I hope some people here go along and discuss theories on music and lyrics to what they tell.

***Thunderstruck***, ***Highwall to Hell***, ***Hells Bells***, etc.

*So, lightning bolt is important because this is how Satan came down from heaven like a* ***rod of lightning****. He was called the* ***Red Dragon****.*

Look at much of albums, artists and more to see the lightning bolt.

[Red and Blue lightning bolt on left side of his face](https://preview.redd.it/j4jbe7sof7t81.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d46abc53914d8df55619505bde0a609f8c13b272)

Let's take a look at one of his songs.

One very important aspect. Lightning bolts sits at the left side of Bowie's face. Jesus sits as God's right hand so did Lucifer sit on the left? Also, prominent colors of Red and Blue. Israel's flag color is blue as are the liberals. Red is the color of Satan the Red Dragon as well as Republicans.

Let's look into one song in particular off a very important album.

**Starman**

Important lyrics to pinpoint:

*That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive*

Remember, Satan came down from a bolt of lightning.

*There's a starman waiting in the skyHe'd like to come and meet usBut he thinks he'd blow our minds*

Lucifer is called the morning star. Also, the tune is similar to that of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" from Wizard of Oz. Rainbows have been a speculated MK Ultra symbol from Illuminati. Also, Oz is two letter word. God is three. Satan falls short of God. Now, why does two matter? Remember 2 is an Illuminati number. The 2nd Seal of Illuminati is the 13 steps Pyramid and All Seeing Eye.

*Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two*

So, 11. 1+1= 2.

The number 13. 1+3= 4.

The number 33. 3+3=6.

6+4+2= 12.

**Theory**:

The alleged message, which occurs during the middle section of the song (“If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow, don’t be alarmed now…”) when played backward, was purported to contain the Satanic references: *“Here’s to my sweet Satan / The one whose little path would make me sad whose power is Satan, / He’ll give you.""*

**Spider**

Let's take a look at importance of the spider.

[Some say owl. Some say spider. The background looks like webs so I say Spider.](https://preview.redd.it/0p70ng5hg7t81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=759331ce72defae1bfc6f19d3fe759cc5144c566)

A spider has 8 legs.

The number 8 can have a hidden meaning.

The pool 8 ball is black. Sin and death is represented as black.

There is a Magic 8 Ball.

Coke 8 ball.

God's perfect number is 7. 8 can represent being above God as to which Lucifer wanted to be.

8 flipped sideways is infinity sign meaning Lucifer wanted to be infinite.

Im sure we can all unravel more as to how spiders can represent more evil than good especially to the Illuminati. They trap in webs. Hide in corners.

Black Widow is deadly and has a spot of red. Red and black represents Satan.

Everything is connected and has meaning. The numbers. The symbols. Artists and more. Lets go even further.

Triggers hairs that sense movement and trap and kill its prey. Notice how this can represent a certain female body part...

I believe that there is something dark in the waters here. The 13 Royal Bloodlines have a trap set. We are in a spiritual chess game of Good vs Evil. The trap can be setting a prominent figure from God to be coerced to evil. How deep do Bloodlines go? Maybe this is why we should not commit adultery and have sex with anyone. DO we know where their roots run to?

Mean Green Mother from Outer Space- ""...*and I am bad*""

The track listing is at 4:44. Again, 4+4+4= 12. This is on purpose.

Remember, God is omnipotent. We have been warned. We are drawing close to some dark spiritual force that will become born I believe. Soon the AntiChrist will come.

*The mood is right. The spirit's up*

*Simply having a wonderful Christmas time*

*Simply having a wonderful Christmas time*

*The word is out*

*About the town*

*To lift a glass*

*And don't look down*

Let me reveal to you a Revelation.

[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2011&version=NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2011&version=NIV)

**10** The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.

(Christmas time huh? Presents exchanged and celebrate.)

**11** But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them. **12** Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on.

**13** At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.

(Don't look down)

*Well one of these nights about twelve o'clock*

*This old world is going to rock*

Here is some movie hints what is to come:

[*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9iDuaiM\_Us&ab\_channel=rapturedpassage*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9iDuaiM_Us&ab_channel=rapturedpassage)

In the movie, the beast with seven heads and ten horns comes out. I do believe that this will be NATO.

After that a small horn arises and this is when the AntiChrist will be elected. Will the small horn be America?

I am still trying to unravel more but through music and movies we may be able to put together this puzzle. The more people configured to helping solve this puzzle and the more people who come find faith in God and choose down the right path will see how Good can win. How good can overcome and our spiritual sense in the world can grow stronger.

*Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and saying,“The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe the gospel.”*

**Follow the Ten Commandments**

[The true law of the land](https://preview.redd.it/98ku9skdh7t81.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f27bfe7e7b445b9f2b7f408f6e72023ea5569e98)

**Proverbs 7:2**

*Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.*

Abstain from the Seven Deadly Sins. *We were warned*.

*Time: 4:13. (4+1+3=8).*

SO, remember this: Love wins. Jesus will come down to save us all. He will judge us. There is a kingdom of God. There is a narrow path. We can always change the road we take. We just need to keep digging further and exposing the evils of the world. Believe in God. Spread love and faith.

I truly pray for us all to live in the Kingdom of God. For peace on Earth. I pray more people can find faith in God. We need to spread this word. We can be mocked and ridiculed but after all, Jesus was mocked and crucified more than we will ever be.

This is what we can do:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIsIdiNO-1Q&ab\_channel=Bunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIsIdiNO-1Q&ab_channel=Bunt)

(Joking mostly...)

***What we can really do:***

**Acts Chapter 2**

**38** Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

**39** For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, *even* as many as the Lord our God shall call.

**Romans 6:23** \- For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.

I recommend more to look deeper into symbolism.

I recommend us to stop this evil spreading from spreading the truth. Spreading Love. Spreading Faith. We will be martyrs. We will be mocked. We will be saved. We will find eternal life.

Here's some music for hope:

Let me start this off with a quick preface. This entire world including the history, present and future is **Biblical.** More than any of us can possible imagine. It makes this life beautiful, tragic, sad, dark but in the end worth it. It will be all worth if it we accept this truth because accepting this means we accept God and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. With that acceptance, we enter into a Kingdom of Heaven for **eternity.**

So, I already know I will be attacked, mocked and humiliated but I could care less! Humility precedes honor and this life has been trash so of course we get another one! Plus having the Holy Spirit come down on me like a wave of joy in indescribable besides knowing and believing how beautiful it is to find faith.

If you want to upset the ""NWO"" or any of these ""secret"" groups like *Illuminati* (planned for ***anti-religion),*** *Freemasonry, Bilderberg Group, 13 Family Bloodlines, and more.* ***PRAY TO GOD.*** That my friends is what they do not want anyone to do. They want us to be sinners and watch us spin into hate with chaos and destruction. Well, look at us. We're all angry, depressed, confused, divided people who cant agree and spill off hate rather love. Not even mentioning how little our generation goes to church or prays or even reads a Bible.

So I write this to you all in true terms of hope and love with all glory to our Almighty Father. God found me and gave me a strong Holy Spirit one night when I prayed and repented after discovering these secret groups and their plan for the AntiChrist. I know none of us can stop it but possible God can and if it can't happen then at least save our souls. Satan can not buy your soul, he cannot do that. Anyone can be saved. I was born a sinner and lived a sinful life but was saved by God's grace and now I want to help anyone here.

***Alright now, let's get this show start.***

*Edit 1: I made changes because I realized this regards to Book of Revelations more than I thought. Sorry and apologies. I will add more if I feel I must. I will continue to study Book of Revelations and try to draw more conclusions and hypothesis.*

**UFO'S = SPIRITUAL FORCES**

So, let's talk UFO's. I am going to talk about one case because it just so may happen to tie into Book of Revelations or possibly what will come to be the Book of Revelations.

***Book of Revelations 12 The Woman and the Dragon***

[*https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%2012&version=NIV*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%2012&version=NIV)

**7** Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. **8** But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. **9** The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.

**17** Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.

This to me is the part of where Satan is cast down upon Earth. So let's go into where and when he was cast down to Earth.

*Long Island, New York*

A place known for so many conspiracy theories but yet none are even listed here. Montauk Project/Monster (Stranger Things based on), Plum Island (Lyme Disease), Gilgo Beach Murders, Tesla Lab, UFO crash (Get ready), and much more.

[https://mapcollections.brooklynhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/02/bhs\_li003424642\_a-2400x1805.jpg](https://mapcollections.brooklynhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/02/bhs_li003424642_a-2400x1805.jpg)

Look at the map and towns.

Babylon, Mt Sinai, Orient, Jericho. Very Biblical names.

Let's also add two more. Shoreham and Wading River. Shoreham (Bethlehem) and Wading River (Jordan River).

Wading River also has St John's the Baptist Roman Catholic Church.

This is just one point to show why this specific UFO crash is more biblical than others.

*UFO Crash*

https://preview.redd.it/nuhfamr14pb81.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bc05778a58a5b4fba9659a8311174ee36acacd58

First off, let me say I do not believe this crash was anything good. Maybe it was but I don't believe in. In fact I believe this ""crash"" were spiritual forces touching down to soon cause mayhem and death.

[https://www.ufoinsight.com/ufos/cover-ups/southaven-park-ufo-crash](https://www.ufoinsight.com/ufos/cover-ups/southaven-park-ufo-crash)

The exact date and time of the crash November 24, 1992 around 7:00pm.

This is important because at this date there was a New Moon.

[https://mooncalendar.astro-seek.com/moon-phase-day-24-november-1992](https://mooncalendar.astro-seek.com/moon-phase-day-24-november-1992)

(Interesting how it came to be at 9:11 which is very important considering 11 is master number for Illuminati. Oh, the number 11 in The Bible symbolize chaos. When 10 represents law (10 commandments) understand 11 is the opposite. Oh, 9 divided by 11 is .81818181. Jesus = 888. God = 1.

 Also, note that November is the 11th month of the year. 

*The Moon*

Quickly here, the sun, moon, stars and everything else as stated in Genesis was created by God.

So, this all said the light is from God so a New Moon can represent darkness with no light coming to be.

*Sagittarius*

[https://www.horoscope.com/zodiac-signs/sagittarius](https://www.horoscope.com/zodiac-signs/sagittarius)

To study this correctly let's take a look:

The ruling planet is Jupiter that has a ""Red Eye'. 

Its sign is Fire. 

It's the Ninth House (From creation).

Sagittarius is 11 letters. Remember, 11 is very important to the Illuminati but to God it is not.

Also, take a look at the celebs who are this sign:

Jay Z (Illuminati), Ozzie Osbourne (Prince of Darkness), Steven Spielberg (\*ahem\* Corey Feldman, ScarJo (Dad was in CIA), Nicki Minaj (illuminati).

I believe this was not jus any ufo crash. This was Satan sent down from above with his demonic spirits (or fallen angels).

I will go into music and movies and how they have foretold us of these oncoming events.

Remember, everything since 1992 has went from bad to worse. Think about how in less than 9 years the Twin Towers fell. In 1992, George H.W Bush was President and he is known to cite ""New World Order"". 

Remember, their plan is to bring about the AntiChrist!

Let's dive into music.

**David Bowie- The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars**

The album was released in 1972. The crash happened 20 years later.

[https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/20.html](https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/20.html)

(Just a quick insight on what numbers can mean. Does not have to be literal and only God knows what is right but it is interesting what 20 has marked in Bible)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Rise\_and\_Fall\_of\_Ziggy\_Stardust\_and\_the\_Spiders\_from\_Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Ziggy_Stardust_and_the_Spiders_from_Mars)

I'll sum up some info gathered here.

The 4th song by Bowie, on this album, ""Starman"" by David Bowie. (Remember 4 means from creation.)

Starman jumbled is Mr. Satan.

Satan is called as the black 5 pointed star.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBKEt3MhNMM&ab\_channel=DavidBowie-Topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBKEt3MhNMM&ab_channel=DavidBowie-Topic)

Let's break down the time. 4:14.

[**King James Bible**](https://biblehub.com/kjv/proverbs/4.htm) 

**Proverb 4:14** Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil *men*.

**Hebrews 4:14** Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.

Also,

[https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/4.html](https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/4.html)

[https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/14.html](https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/14.html)

Adding 4+4+1=9 too.

[https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/9.html](https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/9.html)

Now, this is only something I use to help me see any significance in numbers. If the Illuminati uses them well I believe God must as well. After all, God is 1. Noah had 2 of everything. The Trinity is 3. So on.

So, with these numbers we can see how this can be some spiritual creation made from God above that is ""perfect"".

Let's break down lyrics.

""That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive""

There's a starman waiting in the sky

He'd like to come and meet us

But he thinks he'd blow our minds

There's a starman waiting in the sky

He's told us not to blow it'

Cause he knows it's all worth while

He told me 

Let the children lose it

Let the children use it

Let all the children boogie

So this tune actually mimics the same one as ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" used in Wizard of Oz. 

""Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two"" - Notice how Channel 2 is CBS.

 

[Black eye logo in 1992. Mostly, known as blue too but let's check out that.](https://preview.redd.it/hgpnd1m0iqb81.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ef36d3e75e767cea609a3e37decf1385230fd3cd)

The only inference and conclusion I can make from this was the election. Bill Clinton was elected on Nov 3, 1992. 

One piece to add is the other color of CBS is blue. There is a known stigma that Entertainment has been run by ""Fake Jews"". The ""Star of David"" is also blue. Maybe this a somewhat reference to that. 

This is why Satan came down to strike those around him and why so much bad has happened since the 1990's, especially 2001. Coincidentally, 9/11 happened around 9 years after. If anyone wants to do serious math please help figure out how many days exactly.

Let's move to movies but first check this trailer out.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwPL0Md\_QFQ&ab\_channel=Pixar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwPL0Md_QFQ&ab_channel=Pixar)

(By the way: Infinity is Jesus because 8 inverted is infinity. He also Lives Forever. Jesus- King of Kings and Lord of Lords is Coming!)

**A Quiet Place Pt II**

So, now that we have good news lets get back to the bad. We're still on Earth with these demons and evil forces and this next clip is to show what.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9tKgkEn2uY&ab\_channel=KinoCheck.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9tKgkEn2uY&ab_channel=KinoCheck.com)

SO you don't need to watch all but a crash and monster looking like spiders come out and kill anything to make noise.

In Hollywood and Entertainment, I personally believe this signifies anyone to talk of God, Jesus or the Illuminati who are in fact the monsters.

The crash takes place in Upstate New York and the go to an ""island"" for safety until one monster joins them.

**Little Shop of Horrors**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00o2j1xR1\_o&t=93s&ab\_channel=TheKing890098v2**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00o2j1xR1_o&t=93s&ab_channel=TheKing890098v2)

Just watch the introduction of the narrator to be honest.

It's funny how this takes place 6 years, 2 months and 1 day prior to the crash on Long Island. 6+2+1=9.

[https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/9.html](https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/9.html)

Again, I am not one to take the significance of these numbers meaning to heart but it just adds to the theory and what I am trying to convey here.

**Conclusion**

Im here to show some truths behind ""conspiracies"" because we have been invaded. Invaded by much more than we can imagine. This post was to focus on what I have not seen posted on here. A small town in a small community with ties to a much larger realm in this wild, mad Biblical world we call Earth. Please do not worship me but instead turn to God. You want to know more about what goes on? Read the Bible. The words are written down in past, present and future. He speaks to us all and following him can lead us on a path to life, happiness and eternal life.

Even though we live in the darkest times this still means Jesus is coming! In fact this may actually have been revealed in the Book of Revelations.

**5** She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.”\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%2012&version=NIV#fen-NIV-30897a)\] And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.

**Conclusion**

***Any thanks can only be given to God here.*** If this makes anyone's eyes open I would say follow the Holy Spirit that I have which gave me this clear vision. Reading the Bible can make us interpret much more of what is happening here. 

I am sure this is much more to unravel in this world and I can begin to go deeper into conspiracies as well.

For now as I leave you all here please leave any comments, thoughts and additions if you may. I won't take any offense because after all I am no king nor judge. The one true Judge sits above us and watches us all. So with that, let's live our lives modestly, humbly and away from the evil that tries to entangle us in their dark webs. Spread love, peace and most importantly **Faith.**

***Jesus is coming. King of Kings and Lord of Lords shall rule over us for eternity and may we all be blessed in eternal life of our One True Savior from our Heavenly Father, God.***",conspiracy,Zodiac

78,The Great Year and the Cataclysmic Cycle,13.0,bda70v,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/bda70v/the_great_year_and_the_cataclysmic_cycle/,6.0,1555291231.0,"So, as it's known - the Great Year is the procession of the Equinoxes (a 25,920 year cycle similar to our Seasons on Earth).  Each degree of this cycle (circle) is 72 years in length, one Age/Sign per \~2,160 years.   This knowledge has been known in many cultures, some examples include; [St Peters Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Square#Paving), the Obelisk's Shadow signifies the Equinoxes and procession (which is odd to me, as why would Catholicism promote/edify alternate belief systems), [The Dendera Zodiac in Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendera_zodiac), even the ""most ancient"" [civilizations in Sumeria had the Great Year in depictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astrology), or [the Mayans](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/99/b1/8e/99b18e8600fad6bb2e1d7f023843d053.jpg) across the Ocean etc etc..  


Now, my main point isn't the validation of the Great Year as it's a scientific fact that can be observed in the Stars/Constellations and our procession.  


In this Great Year, it is ""broken"" into two halves that are 12,960 years apart.  As one half of the Great Year passes into the next, a seemingly natural (or initiated?) cataclysm occurs (by fire, flood and more) to ""reset"" the times.  We have scientific data that says there [was a great occurrence](https://phys.org/news/2012-09-theory-impact-event-years.html) \~12,800-12,900 [years ago](https://tiybos.com/evidence-suggests-pillar-43-at-gobekli-tepe-depicts-a-comet-impact-13000-years-ago-vindicating-the-work-of-author-graham-hancock/).  In dozens upon dozens of myths across the Planet and time, we have the story of the Great Flood (going back to Sumerian times).  This flood is etched into stone across the world and in our psyche.  Prior to the flood, if you go back to \~26,000 years ago, we have what is known as the [Last Glacial Maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum).  Just like the [Younger Dryas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas) period of \~12,900-11,700, it is a massive shift in temperature (hot or cold), initiated by a grand force (impact comet, super volcano, passing massive object - we really don't know for sure).  


So, to recap before I go on - there is a cyclical ""year"" which is marked/observed through the procession of the Equinoxes (which many ancient sites are aligned to or focus on).  This Great Year has moments of catastrophe, like the Fall and Winter bring death, they also bring potential for new life in the coming months.  It is believed that we have yet to face our next grand cleansing/cataclysm, but here is where new knowledge makes me think otherwise.  


With the recent discovery of Tartary and the Mudflood hypothesis, it makes one wonder if this erased Country was the latest Lemuria, Atlantis etc to be destroyed by the Great Year's cataclysms.  So, the great sites like Gobekli Tepe, the Great Pyramids/Sphinx?, Angkor Wat, Easter Island and more could potentially be from the great Flood (Younger Dryas).  The ancient sites align with the Stars as they were at 10,500 BC ([as Grahan Hancock points out](https://youtu.be/T5DNvYMtkyk)).  Prior to that was Atlantis (from the Last Glacial Maximum) but I'm not sure?  


What if Tartary was the last victim of the Great Year, just under two centuries ago in what is now being called the Mud Flood?  The latest videos that show the [Panama Pacific Worlds Fair of San Francisco of 1915](https://youtu.be/Xd29lk-g9vA), or the [World's Fair of St Louis in 1904](https://youtu.be/dX1cr7RvvBA) start to give you a picture of the Majesty that was potentially the last great civilization to grace the planet.  The architecture on display is of such intricate and overwhelming size/stature that it is impossible to believe it was just scaffolding, plaster and empty - built temporarily to be razed.  These (and many more) wonderful works have been completely leveled ([some still remain today](http://pontus.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/palace_of_fine_arts-_san_francisco_ca_combo_1915-2015.jpg)) the years following the Expo's.  It is unfathomable to me why in the world such works would be leveled unless to erase the past.    


What if the cataclysm we all researched was eventually coming, already happened (the Mudflood of 18XX's)?  What if the New World Order is already in place - a system of debt and usury, central banks, perpetual war, pestilence, famine and death?  What if this northern hemisphere civilization, with free energy and advanced ""antiquetech"", phenomenal architecture/structures is being actively suppressed or inundated to mask it's presence and importance?  What if there is a society who knew it was coming, squirreled away knowledge and technology to come out on top after the reset?  What if we already lost and the new prison is in place?...

79,Radiocarbon C14 dating conspiracy,12.0,lvyexj,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lvyexj/radiocarbon_c14_dating_conspiracy/,4.0,1614678577.0," 

Very sorry about c14 radiocarbon dating methods, the poor Nobel Libby must be turning in his grave after arbitrary ‘calibration’ of his method  (pity that!).

By ‘calibration’ on a *statistically non-significant number* of wood samples from Egypt with the arbitrarily suggested *alleged* age of 3100 B.C. the Arizona University radiocarbon team simply smuggled the consensual chronology into the c14 method of dating, turning it into a sheer fallacy. This ‘calibration’ curve allows arbitrary dating of samples by the radiocarbon laboratory.

Dr. Libby honestly earned his Nobel by developing a valid dating method (albeit a very pollution sensitive one), and on top of it, this method became very un-precise after the unknown tonnages of radiocarbon c14 isotope were dumped into the atmosphere in the course of US-USSR-France-UK nuclear tests in the friendly nuclear race of the fifties.

**The c14 radiocarbon dating procedure** runs as follows: archaeologist sends an artifact to a radiocarbon dating laboratory with his idea of the age of the object to get a ‘scientific’ rubber-stamp. Laboratory gladly complies and makes required radio dating, confirming the date suggested by the archaeologist.

Everybody’s happy: lab makes good money by making an expensive test, the archaeologist by reaping the laurels for his earth-shattering discovery.

The in-built low precision (because of high sensitivity) of this method allows cooking up scientifically looking results desired by the customer-archaeologist. The general public doesn’t realize that it was duped again.

Just try to submit to any c14 lab a sample of organic matter and ask them to date it. The lab will ask your idea of the age of the sample, then it fiddles with the lots of knobs (‘fine-tuning’) and gives you the result as you’ve ‘expected’.

With the c14 dating method being allegedly so mind-bogglingly precise C14 labs decline to make ‘black box’ test of any kind *absolutely*.

Nah, they assert that because their method is SO very sensitive, they must have maximum information about the sample.

This much-touted method often produces reliable dating of objects of organic origin with exactitude (mistakes that) of up to plus-minus 1500 years, therefore it is too crude for dating of historical events in the 3000 years timeframe!

80,Perhaps a stupid question but...,13.0,m5umee,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/m5umee/perhaps_a_stupid_question_but/,22.0,1615841665.0,"...what exactly would qualify as a ""link"" to accept that a death might in fact be caused by a vaccine?

I mean, right now we have some blood clothing related deaths shortly after the vaccine, but ""there is no (proven) link"".

Fine. But just what exactly would be a proven link? It's not like the vaccine is going to leave a note like the zodiac killer. And the lack of understanding what a plausible mechanism of these deaths could be does not mean there is no mechanism in action.

See, the thing is, there is IMO no such thing as a proof that vaccine caused death, because it's always just a trigger for a cascade effect, and ultimately there's something else that kills you, like blood cloth, paralysis, which is basically impossible to prove it was caused by the vaccine.

The only way to prove something fishy is going on is by statistical sampling, but even there you can't guarantee to prove it, not to mention you need to have a trustworthy data collection mechanism. 

An example would be 1976 swine flu vaccine which caused one Guillain-Barré syndrome case per 100,000 persons vaccinated, which is more than expected in general population.

But even there, I can already hear shills saying ""the benefits out-weight the risks"". Which is a good argument if you have an IQ of a gold fish, because, what benefit is in it for the affected individual and their families, god fucking damnit.

In short: we are doomed. The level of stupidity is at 11, true idiocracy in action. You can't fight it with reason. You can't fight it at all, as you are outnumbered 100 to 1. They won. We are fucked.",conspiracy,Zodiac

This meditation helps the Light forces to ground the energy of Light on the surface of the planet to strengthen the Light grid which is needed to speed up the process of Full Disclosure and Ascension. Number of people doing that meditation is the single most influential factor within the power of the surface human population for speeding up the process.

We can reach the critical mass of 144,000 people doing this meditation! This will create a massive healing chain reaction in the energy field worldwide. The focus will be on the United States, where much healing is needed.

Astrological chart for our meditation shows a powerful grand trine between Galactic center / Saturn / Lilith in Sagittarius, Eris / Uranus in Aries and Mars / Lunar Node / Sun / Moon in Leo. The core of this grand trine is exact grand trine of Galactic Center at 28 degrees Sagittarius, Uranus at 28 degrees Aries and Sun / Moon eclipse at 28 degrees Leo. At the eclipse, the energy of electric fire of liberation will flow from the Galactic Center (the Pleroma) throughout the Solar System and will be channeled through Uranus and through the Sun / Moon eclipse, all of them located in fire zodiacal signs. Therefore our meditation at the moment of the eclipse has a potential for a huge breakthrough on the planetary surface, as it is a moment of the most direct connection with the Galactic Center.

**MALTA, VALETTA** \- Tradition holds that before the British govt. sealed up several tunnels, one could walk from one end of Malta to the other underground. One of the labyrinths, discovered by excavators, is the Hypogeum of Sal Saflini \[or Saflienti!?\], in which excavators discovered the bones of over 33,000 people who had been sacrificed by an ancient pagan neolithic cult. National Geographic, Aug. 1940 issue, told of several school children who had disappeared without a trace in the Hypogeum. British embassy worker Miss Lois Jessup convinced a guide to allow her to explore a 3-ft. square ""burial chamber"" next to the floor of the lowest room in the last \[3rd\] sub-level of the catacombs. He reluctantly agreed and she crawled through the passage until emerging on a cavern ledge overlooking a deep chasm. In total shock she saw a procession of TALL humanoids with white hair covering their bodies walking along another ledge about 50 feet down on the opposite wall of the chasm. Sensing her they collectively lifted their palms in her direction at which a strong ""wind"" began to blow through the cavern and something big, ""slippery and wet"" moved past her before she left in terror to the lower room, where the guide gave her a ""knowing"" look. Later she returned after the 30 school children and their teacher\[s\] had disappeared in the same passage that she had explored, only to find a new guide who denied any knowledge of the former guides' employment there. She heard reports however that after the last child had passed through the ""burial chamber"" and out onto the ledge, a ""cave-in"" collapsed the burial chamber and the rope connecting them to the lower chamber was later found to be ""cut clean"". Grieving Mothers of several of the children swore that for a week or more following the disappearance they could hear their children crying and screaming ""as if from underground"".

Enjoy the read however! I did this theory for a Spanish project lol

**Origin of D.B. Cooper:** D.B. Cooper was a thief who stole $200,000 (equivalent to $1,240,000 in 2018.)  
He's an unidentified man who hijacked a plane, named ""Boeing 727.""  
This was located in the northwestern United States, between Portland, Oregon and Seattle and on a Wednesday afternoon on November 24th, 1971. D.B. Cooper also left some clues including his clip tie, which helped rule out some suspects. He also left behind a parachute and used part of the parachute to tie up the money he had stolen.

**Now onto the evidence supporting the theory that D.B. Cooper and the Zodiac Killer are the same person:**

There are many reasons why people think they are the same person. One reason is that they both look similar. They have some of the same facial characteristics. And while the 'photos' are just sketches, they look pretty similar in some ways.  
The timeline between the Zodiac Killer and D.B. Cooper are another reason. The Zodiac Killer stopped killing in 1970 which, if he was also D.B. Cooper, could give him a year to plan and then hijack a plane and disappear a year later. So they both disappeared at about the same time. The Zodiac Killer killed in the northwestern United States and D.B. Cooper got into a plane in the northwestern United States. The locations are not exactly the same, as D.B. Cooper got into a plane in Portland while the Zodiac killer killed in other northwestern States; California, Nevada, etc. According to the Cold Case Investigative Institute, the Zodiac Killer often piloted airplanes as well and was obsessed with airplanes and flying. The names he signed were names of aircraft types, as well as the symbols he used were sometimes found on airplanes and airports. D.B. Cooper was also obviously obsessed with airplanes, it is evident that he had at least basic knowledge of airplanes, as he jumped off the plane with a parachute in bad weather conditions in a random place. Therefore, both the Zodiac Killer and D.B. Cooper were obsessed with airplanes and flying and both had basic pilot skills. Both are mysteries and have gotten away with their crimes. Both were obviously geniuses to be able to escape with their crimes. And lastly, they both wrote notes and taunted the police.

87,The End of Free Love,11.0,cpkdl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cpkdl0/the_end_of_free_love/,4.0,1565651945.0,"I was chatting to a guy today and our conversation led to certain thing I had not quite thought of before.

I brought up the subject of the 1960's Free Love counter culture, and the strange and sudden way it ended, I mentioned the Zodiac and Son of Sam killings as potentially deliberate attacks and also mentioned the Manson killings. He is not a conspiracy theorist but what he said made me look at this era in a whole, new fresh way.

He said, that the Manson killings made sense because if you wanted to end a movement, you would not do it by attacking from outside, but you would bring it down from inside. We elaborated that Charles Manson makes sense as a way to end a potentially dangerous peace culture, and he could be innocent and the women around him could possibly be agents employed to attack a symbol of a subversive movement that, during the Vietnam War, went beyond its bounds.

So that stimulated a stream of thought that seems to have led to undeniably intriguing conclusions.

If viewed from the perspective of Intelligence, during Vietnam, the Hippy, Counter Culture movement (they apparently helped create originally for unknown reasons ) had become a serious nuisance. At some point, the free love era had to be stopped and come to an end.

If that is the case, then the best way would be to create something like Charles Manson.

This era was also the era of MLK's assassination. Whilst most people are not greatly influenced by the content of music, it is reasonable to consider that the messages in music at that time looked powerful from the point of view of intelligence agencies, considering that music was much more prominent then than in previous times, so they associated it with the contemporary movement against foreign actions like Vietnam.

Therefore, they needed to end that movement, the 1960's free love and hippy culture had to end. They I believe ended it with Manson, and also certain alleged Serial Killers, this intended to attack the communal bonds in the free love community. Serial Killers like the Zodiac and Son of Sam, targeted couples courting, and this represented the killing of the 60's culture directly. It certainly changed public perceptions in a way that made people more cautious and afraid, ideal if one wanted to bring the 60's as it survived into the 70's, to an end.

If you consider this as possible, now the death of John Lennon makes sense. He, like MLK, preached free love. From the Intelligence perspective, after they deployed Manson and the like, and killed MLK, then the only surviving strand of that free love movement was Lennon, and so he was seen as a potential rebel leader that could bring back the movement they had effectively killed. That is why he had to die, because he was the only one who could bring that back.

It was they, intelligence, that believed music controlled people. So they saw Lennon as a potential 'prophet' similar to MLK.

If one wants a nation to go to war, one does not want the generation of warriors educated by hippies and counter-culture free love types.

So, is it a coincidence that heavy metal started after the end of the 60's Free Love era? It actually now makes sense that the musical style went so dark. It was not a coincidence, but a result of Intelligence beliefs, beliefs of the power of musical culture, and that fact in terms of its potential influence and support in relation to previously determined plans on a geopolitical level - a much bigger game that desired war.",conspiracy,Zodiac

There’s been a huge news story going around my town & state  for the past week or so. Apparently a guy who killed him self in 2002 was recently identified after it was revealed he had been using a stolen identy and disappeared several years ago. There’s a news story [here](http://fox8.com/2018/06/21/who-was-joseph-newton-chandler-iii-authorities-to-reveal-true-identity-of-mystery-man/?utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_content=5b2ca6aa04d3017f42ecd6f6&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=facebook) if you want to read more about it.

Since this has been revealed there are several theories of who he actually was. Some think the Zodiac killer, which is plausible because there is evidence he was in the area at the time. Some people are saying D.B. cooper, which seems less likely as it was speculated DB had extensive air training, and so far the “Mystery Man” doesn’t seem to have been involved in air training during his military life. (There’s also a third theory that he was involved in the murder of a local child but that’s only a local story).

I’ve been fascinated with DB Cooper since I was a kid, but this story got me thinking. Is it possible that DB & Zodiac could have been the same person? It’s a long shot but is anyone familiar with the Zodiac story enough to know if the timelines could match up?

This story has been a source of focus in the area for about a week so everyone is excited to learn more about who this guy actually was. He never really talked to anyone and was always ready at the go so they know he was hiding from something, now the big mystery is what.",conspiracy,Zodiac

One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. It is unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non-contiguous parts, Serpens Caput (Serpent Head) to the west and Serpens Cauda (Serpent Tail) to the east. Between these two halves lies the constellation of Ophiuchus, the ""Serpent-Bearer"". In figurative representations, the body of the serpent is represented as passing behind Ophiuchus between Mu Serpentis in Serpens Caput and Nu Serpentis in Serpens Cauda

The serpent that ophiuchus is holding is the ouroboros. The continuing cycle. Here's another way of looking at Ophiuchus, the Snake Holder and The Ouroboros, if the Ouroboros represents cycles, perhaps Ophiuchus is showing us how to control or change those cycles. He mastered death . When the ouroboros is stretched out, it is the way out instead of circling back around the cycle. Think of it this way the ouroboros is naturally eating it's own tail. Ophiuchus mastered death, and leads souls out by stretching out the serpent from it's cycle shape.

Ophiuchus is known as the serpent holder, featuring a human figure holding a snake around its waist and its hands directing the serpent’s two ends in opposite directions. The right-handed (masculine) side of the serpent stretches out laterally over the constellation of Scorpio, while the left-handed (feminine) side points in an almost vertical ascent toward the North.


The serpent represents the great ouroboros; in it’s curled state, it symbolizes the feminine (Shakti/Yin) aspect of the cyclical rhythms of life leading unto death leading unto life again. She dwells in all realms and her serpentine path both through the cosmos and through our physical lives forms the desires of seekers willing to experience the mysteries of the unknown. In the Tao, she is known as The Way, in the Kaballah, the No Thing, in Buddhism, the Eternal Void. She is the dark and impenetrable primordial womb. From this unnameable and unknowable place she leads us into physical manifestation and guides us out again when our time is done here. This is why egyptians wore the image of the coiled and erect asp around their foreheads. Within Ophiuchus, the left hand of this snake points upward, toward her source, reminding us from whence we have come and to which we shall return.Known as the radial line of the Serpent, the standard measure for the Motions of the heavenly bodies and the cycle of time in the mysteries of the Mysteries. It is the Ouroboros, the Serpent devouring its own tail, the AUR-boros, or Northern Lights, that has its Center at the Pole star and its Circle divided by a radial line from this Pole star to its circumference.


Greek myth, Ophiuchus represents the god of medicine, Asclepius. Asclepius was the son of Apollo and was taught by Chiron, the Centaur. He learned how to bring people back from the dead, which worried Hades. ... The brightest star is called Ras Alhague, and is the head of the serpent bearer.


Ophiuchus is a constellation – not a sign – of the zodiac . ... Antique colored etching of old bald, bearded man in Greek garb holding a long snake


OPHIUCHUS, The Serpent Holder, is associated with Aescupalius, the noted healer of Greek legend. His mother Coronis was courted by the god Apollo and she eventually became pregnant. However, this did not stop her falling for a mere mortal, Ischys by name. The god had left a white crow to keep watch on Coronis and, when it reported her infidelity, Apollo was so furious that it had not immediately pecked out Ischys's eyes that he cursed the bird and turned it black. When Artemis, Apollo's huntress sister, heard of the behaviour of Coronis, she shot a quiverful of arrows into her. Apollo saved his unborn son, named him Aesculapius, and took him to Chiron, the kind and extremely wise centaur, who taught him the art of medicine. The youth mastered the art completely, so much so that Hades, King of the Underworld, feeling threatened should Aesculapius be able to raise the dead, complained to Zeus. The great god regrettably decided that Aesculapius must die, and struck him with a thunderbolt, thereafter placing him among the stars. To this day, Aesculapius and the serpent are associated with healing, and all physicians take the Hippocratic oath (Hippocrates supposedly being a descendant of Aesculapius

After Asclepius's death, Zeus placed his body among the stars as the constellation Ophiuchus (""the Serpent Holder"").


Later, however, upon Apollo's request, Zeus resurrected Asclepius as a god and gave him a place on Olympus




Ophiuchus means serpent bearer. The constellation represents Asclepius. The Greeks did equate the serpent with Apollo, and Asclepius. Being father and son that would be obvious. The serpent is the milky way galaxy. Here is a photo of milky way by NASA.

https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0403/v838feb04_hst_bck.jpg

the ouroboros was invented as a reference to the Milky Way Galaxy and the connection that it has to many of life’s answers that we seek. There are many references in mythology to ‘the serpent of light’ that supposedly lived in the heavens. This serpent resembles the ouroboros and the location is an obvious reference to the galaxy. There are those who wonder if the connection of this symbol to space means that our ancestors were able to answer questions that still hold mystery for many today.

Plato’s Description of the First Being In his work, Timaeus, Plato refers to the ouroboros as the first living creature in existence. As the first, it was the most perfect because of its self-sufficiency. The ouroboros had no eyes because outside itself there was nothing to be seen. It had no ears because there was nothing outside itself to listen to. This creature was a self-eating and circular being. Despite of its self-eating nature, however, it had no organs that would allow it to digest for there was nothing that could come into its system that existed outside of itself. It also lacked the ability to breathe for similar reasons.

The only one of the senses that this creature was given was the ability to move and writhe in it’s circular nature that represented the essence of its being

We encounter the infinity symbol Ouroboros is almost every ancient culture. It has been suggested that that the Milky Way galaxy was the source of inspiration for the infinity symbol. In mythology, the myths regarding the infinity symbol tells us that a serpent of light that lives in the Heaven.

The Milky Way galaxy, which has the shape of a circle, was considered to be this serpent in these myths.

From a Gnostic viewpoint, the opposing ends of the ouroboros were interpreted as the divine and earthly in man, which, despite being at odds with one another, existed in unison nonetheless. In this sense, it is comparable to the Chinese yin and yang, depicting the harmony of contrary forces, as well as the cosmic dichotomy of light and darkness in Manichaeism and the Zoroastrian philosophy of the farvahar, which first posited that each soul was composed of a pure, divine component, as well as a human one.

The ouroboros also appears in other ancient traditions. In Norse mythology, the serpent Jörmungandr encircles the world with its tail in its mouth, while in Hinduism, the ouroboros forms part of the foundation upon which the Earth rests. In the more widespread Roman variant of Iranian Mithraism, Zurvan, symbolising ‘boundless time’, is depicted with an ouroboros entwined around his body, while the Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl is often seen in the form of an ouroboros.

As if this weren’t enough, the ouroboros went on to enjoy much popularity among Renaissance alchemists. Again representing the infinite nature of time and the eternal, it was seen in the eyes of the alchemists as the ultimate obstacle to be overcome in the Magnum Opus, their incessant struggle; for to become immortal – their chief aim – meant to break the incessant cycle of the ouroboros once and for all.

If ophiuchus represents Asclepius, and ophiuchus means serpent bearer, and the serpent represents the milky way galaxy, and the symbol predates Greek mythology, this would mean that the myths originated from the constellation.",conspiracy,Zodiac

The event was so diabolical, so *grand*, that it literally brought about an alchemical transmutation in the minds of the populace. 

The events that day polarized the world more than any before: some people were thrust further into the blindness of their ""matrix"", and others were catapulted directly out of it, being forced into Chapel Perilous.

I've come a long way in my research surrounding this event (as have many of you), but I wasn't prepared for the revelations in this book: [""The Most Dangerous Book in the World: 9/11 as Mass Ritual""](http://www.amazon.com/The-Most-Dangerous-Book-World/dp/1937584178/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1355502572&sr=8-1&keywords=the+most+dangerous+book+in+the+world).

So, why are the flight numbers on 9/11 so important? 

11...175...77...93...

...and what do they have to do with ""the wickedest man in the world"", [Aleister Crowley?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley)

The Twin Towers, the Twin Pillars of Hercules, the Gemini of astrology, Jachin and Boaz of Freemasonry (with the ""Salomon's"" Temple Building 7 accompanying them)...were they constructed with the foreknowledge that they would be brought down in a fiery sacrificial cataclysm?

So what does this have to do with the infamous Aleister Crowley? And what does the number 11 have do with all of this?

In Crowley's own words: the number 11 is ""the number of Magick in itself [and] therefore suitable to all types of operation. [It is] the sacred number par excellence of the new Aeon [the Aeon of Horus, Crowley's name for the new age, with himself as the prophet, of course.]""

What better way to start a Mega-Ritual on the 11th day of September (111 days before the end of the year) than to have Flight 11 crash into the tower on the 93rd floor (the significance of that number will become apparent, if it isn't already).

And the second plane? Flight 175 would soon smash into the *77th* floor of the other tower. We'll get to the 77, but for now what's the significance of 175?

Since we're in the realm of Crowley, let's see what he had to say about 175.

""There are three main methods of invoking any Deity...The 'First Method' consists of devotion to that Deity...a perfect instruction exists in Liber 175. This is the book of uniting to a particular Deity by devotion.""

[Here's the Wikipedia page for the Libri of Crowley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libri_of_Aleister_Crowley). Note that 175 says ""On uniting oneself to a Deity.""

Before you start to think this is getting way too esoteric, I'll give you three guesses as to which Deity was being invoked (and the first two don't count).

Again in Crowley's own words: ""I was not content to believe in a personal devil and serve him, in the ordinary sense of the word. I wanted to get hold of him personally and become his chief of staff.""

So, is there an unusual event that might give us an idea which Deity was invoked when 175 supposedly hit the tower?

If you recall what the Commander in Thief at the time was doing, well then it should become painfully obvious.

The moment the 2nd plane hit the tower George W. Bush was reading [""The Pet Goat""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Pet_Goat) in Sarasota, Florida, strangely enough just 10 miles away from Venice, the location of the flight school Mohamed Atta and another ""hijacker"" trained at. What a coincidence!

This ""reading"" of The Pet Goat was essentially a ""Black Mass"", a ""satirical ceremony, a Commander-in-Chief that wouldn't leave his seat until the reading of a story about a pet goat was completed (""I read this book that I may study the nature of my Deity,"") during which time hundreds of his fellow Americans were in harm's way, many of them meeting horrific ends as they burned alive or plunged to their deaths from the towers (""Yet also may he deliberately practise cruelties"")--conjuring the image of [The Tower tarot card](http://www.rootwerx.com/tarotdecks/bosch/the-tower/images/Rider-Waite_The_Tower_large.jpg)--all taking place in...""Paradise,"" the city of Sarasota's unofficial yet widely-used nickname. Well How about that?""

For those who still are unsure what Deity was being invoked, [here's an image that may give you a hint](http://kkoagulaa.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/baphomet.jpg).

If you *still* think all of this is a stretch, hang on, it gets better (or worse, depending on how you look at it)!

AA77 was supposedly piloted by an individual who, according to one of his instructors, ""could not fly at all."" And yet he was able to pull off an *incredible* stunt, and instead of attacking several more strategic points in the Pentagon, he just so happened to choose the very wing were the DoD's accounting division was located...and conveniently enough Donald Rumsfeld had announced the *day before* the attacks they they couldn't account for $2.3 *trillion* in transactions. The records of this and interest in this announcement all but disappeared after the attacks.

Is there significance to the number 77? You bet your occult-deciphering ass there is. 

[A∴A∴](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4) is a magical order that was created by Crowley in 1907. [Here's their seal](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/A.%27.a.%27._seal.png).

AA77 anyone???????

From The Book of Lies: ""7, the septenary; 11, the magical number; 77, the manifestation, therefore, of the septenary. Through matter, because 77 is written in Hebrew Ayin Zayin (OZ), and He-Goat, the symbol of matter, Capricornus, the Devil of the Tarot; which is the picture of the Goat of the Sabbath upon an altar.

Black Mass anyone?

Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, lists 77 ""infernal names"" of the ""Gods and Goddesses of the Royal Palace of Hell.""

It gets better: the Pentagon, which is 77 feet tall, is located on the [*77th meridian west!*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77th_meridian_west). Oh and George H.W. Bush, who first announced his plans for a ""New World Order"" on September 11th, 1990 (11 years before...well shit this is just getting too obvious), well daddy Bush was...77 at the time of the attacks.

For the record, I'm not demonizing *any* of these numbers. Symbols can be used for good *or* evil, I don't believe a number can be inherently ""evil."" After all, ""Symbols don't kill people; people with symbols kill people.""

Any more 77's we can add to this already overbearing occult script? You bet.

I'm sure most of you are familiar with the ""mystery plane"" that was spotting in New York and above the Pentagon during the attacks. The plane has [since been identified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4#September_11.2C_2001) as the E-4B, a highly secretive and advanced plane also referred to as the ""Doomsday Plane"".

A FOIA request *finally* got more information from the FAA in 2008 about this extremely unusual plane that should *not* have been there (unless it piloting the attack aircraft by remote control, but that opens a whole new can of worms. The call sign of this plane that was spotted above the Pentagon during the attack? VENUS77!

For those that are astrologically-minded, the conjunctions of the planet Venus against the Zodiac [form a pentagram!](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m4vuo4c01W4/ULUX7nPQdBI/AAAAAAAAA74/7kuCnP21xYk/s1600/Example_Venus_pentagram.jpg)...Venus invokes the pentagram (plenty of information available on this with a simple online search).

So Flight 77 eliminates Rummy's dirty laundry (along with anyone else who knew too much) by hitting the 77-foot tall Pentagon (with 7 floors!), on the 77th meridian west, while the Doomsday Plane, call sign Venus77 (Pentagram 77!) circles above. Oh, and flight 175, the plane that evoked the ""Deity"", hit the 77th floor.

And what about that final number? Flight 11 hit floor 93...the final fateful flight that day was...drumroll...flight 93!

For those who are familiar with Crowley, this 4th flight is by far the *easiest* to associate with the diabolical individual.

In fact, there's an entire [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/93_%28Thelema%29) on the importance of the number 93 to Crowley and his religious philosophy Thelema. In fact, Thelemites ofter greet each other with ""93"" or will sign correspondences with ""93/93"" at the end. Flight 93...flight AA11 crashes into the 93rd floor...is this starting to make more or less sense?

There is a great deal of information out their on Building 7 as well, including it essentially being an occult-Masonic construct (Salomon building anyone?). It's 47 stories and trapezoidal shape can attest to that (the 47th Problem of Euclid, also known as the Pythagorean Theorem, ""represents a perfect symbol of Freemasonry"").

There is of course a *whole* new can of worms to open with respect to the *astrological* importance of the 9/11 Mega-Ritual, but there is far too much information on this topic to delve into here, as this is already becoming long-winded.

However, more information can be found in this [well-made series of Youtube videos.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkwBjLG1ULA&feature=player_embedded#!) In a nutshell, Saturn and Pluto achieved a position of powerful opposition on September 11th, 2001 (they are both considered to be ""Lords of Death). Any astrologer can tell you that this alignment does *not* bode well for the people on Earth.

Whether or not you believe in astrology is irrelevant...what *is* relevant is that TPTB *do* believe in this stuff and they flaunt it in our faces because they *can*.

For those of you who *have* been studying these occult scripts, it should come as no surprise that Sirius would get dragged into this mess as well. 

From ""The Most Dangerous Book"": ""Today's Coptic calendar (also called the Alexandrian calendar) is based on the ancient Egyptian calendar and is still used in Egypt, and also by the Coptic Orthodox Church. The first month of the year is named Thout, after Thoth, and thus the first day of the New Year is the 1st of Thout. On the Gregorian calendar, this date coincides with September 11th--so that date is not only New Year's Day, but, more importantly, it is the symbolic, or observed, date of Sirius' heliacal rising.""

Of course, the precession of the equinoxes has shifted this a bit, and today that date has shifted 45 days...now the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs on August 5th.

You'll never guess which date *both* the Statue of Liberty (really an homage to both Isis and Lucifer) and the Twin Towers were ""initiated""...August 5th! (Oh, and the Pentagon was initiated in a Masonic ceremony on September *11th* 1941.)

The occult importance of Sirius is beyond the scope of this post, but just trust me that it's important! Did TPTB do anything to associated the event with the word ""Sirius?"" You betcha.

Do a search for 9/11 and Sirius and you'll find that the only K-9 (K=11...11-9...9-11...maybe I need to slow down a bit) who died on that fateful day was named.......SIRIUS. Sirius was dog number 17...17 is The Star in the Tarot...which according to occultists depicts the star of SIRIUS. cough.

If you think it's overkill that they would name and sacrifice a dog merely to add another layer to their occult script, well then you still don't really get how these events work. The *more* symbolism they cram into the rituals, the more powerful the ritual becomes.

For more information on the occult significance of the numbers and astrology behind the events of 9/11, I recommend [this article](http://intothefaerywoods.blogspot.com/2011/09/aleister-crowley-core-layer-of-matrix.html) and [this interview](http://vftb.net/?p=3984) with the other of another book on this topic (which I haven't read) ""Prophet of Evil: Aleister Crowley, 9/11 and the New World Order"".

In closing I should mention that S.K. Bain, the author of ""The Most Dangerous Book in the World: 9/11 as Mass Ritual"", predicted a false flag event in Phoenix last Christmas which obviously didn't come to pass (although he seemed to leave it open for the next few years while Obama is still president). That being said, while he lost some credibility for this failed prediction, it doesn't affect the overall credibility of the 9/11-Crowley connection in my eyes, which seems increasingly plausible after considering all these ""coincidences"".

Because this is known by the government they have a lot of ways to try and slow you down. The actions overlooked by each other is one, the opinions of these enforcers, their previous thoughts and actions, also The pills they force you to take are part those deterrents. ANOTHER one is radio frequencies, i noticed this when I had an actual different experience going to sleep with no electronics on in the house, not even a phone. Even the food you eat affects how you feel about things in life, as food is the means to the ability of the body, relative to how you process information. Look at the two hands symbol usually found on traffic tickets. That is the understanding of transfer of self to the establishment, think the cosmos with two black holes, due to the sheer force of the ""state"" they ""can and will use everything say\* against you in a ""court"" of law."" Like a basketball court, they will take your life and put it thru a merciless battle to see if you're allowed to walk on the free side of things. Take jury duty as the proof. The judges look at these jurors as ""slaves to society"", thinking because they exist in their towns they should be forced into their freedoms be reckoned elsewhere at their will and command. While the judge at any point can decide to throw out charges that may hinder the belief of said cult. The proof of this inaction/action cult  is where I live ,in NJ, they are REFUSING to stop fentanyl sales and crack cocaine sales but at the same time are actively still raiding and jailing cannabis dealers after the state legalized it, I guess since the town of Camden city new jersey is broke they like this type of thing, as it allows them to have people to ticket if they don't like who bought the drugs or who sold their.

Take food for example, did you ever wonder where your thoughts are coming from? Well its directly related to how the food was made and if its processed through another entity before you eat it, think animals, you aren't eating something from the sun, you are eating something else that had to process that food ""information if you will"".  If you understand the theory of relativity and how the Fibonacci sequence works you will see a lot of connections in everything, including how relative your name is, your birthdate, and even zodiac sign to other people that you encounter.  You will find the people wanting you to eat the processed meat as a larger entity then those that would prefer you to eat local grown as then you will experience a lot more friendly people or worst  find out what you have been lied to about. ( I know the people who are eating animals will be offensive over this, so I will have you know I consume meat my self although it is due to monetary reasons not because I would choose to normally.)

Take your eyes as black holes, they suck in all the light. If you believe god said he created man in his image and you believe in math at all then you will understand what I am implying with the relativeness to all of this. IF you just understand the big bang you will understand how all of this is relative.  Your eye color can change on a normal basis from being close to someone with a different eye color, personally my eyes used to be much greener till I met this woman who I had a child with and now my eyes have more blue in them than ever before. Your third eye is the space you own as you are protected like the planet with your own ""ozone"" . When you have a kid you pass down the energy of the third eye which is a collection of more than just the person you conceived the child with as your children wont look all the same, they wont think all the same, nor do all the same as you. They are a collection of everyone in existence as well as we are started as one form of energy and will end as one form assumingly in a black hole.

In the closet part of the world we are will see our existence in many planes, down to a literal sense, but also to extent of our future and past, the space is before anything, the sun is the big bang, the moon is the planet before life and the earth is current. The oil we dig up is literally of another time life and since we are beings of current and the big bang theory states it all happened at point of conception, the animals live congruent with us as a parallel time, this is how we get the electronics to seemingly do the work for us.  Parallel insists we will never cross paths, however we go back into time literally when digging into earth and the earth standalone will also have the point of similarities as the big bang, in the center you have extremely hot mass , like the big bang a large form of energy. Then you have layers of different non and potential life forming, like bacteria , single celled , in the universe we have black holes, single cells.

Everything we say in the English language is relative due to it being the most commonly used as the Universal language. With this being said a lot of life can exist through this point of plane as we are all one. So outlets of different directions have to exist.

We are wrapped together in time and space through the movement of the sun and the earth and the moon . Along with the solar system with all together makes life possible in this relative galaxy. The color spectrums we see are all found in planets in our system as well.  This movement of earth is a stitching in space and time if you will. My grandmother was a switch board operator, the stitching of that into current time along with her time period would state she has the power of manifestation with this switch boarding to be relative today allowing me to seemly connect with people using a six sense, as she was part of this communication process that today has became the internet  phones and computers we use today.

Petroleum based products are found everywhere, including in plastics, gasoline, and even energy is produced at nuclear fatuities with these refined resources. You put your self into the mix along with everything that came before it when you work at a place that puts these types of products out. Think drugs, the makers of the drugs are directly getting your time when sold, also they receive the parts of life you miss out on including the happy and sad parts and they are replaced with the dealers. IF you get paranoid from smoking weed you are feeling what the person who helped it get from seed to consumption felt. Down to the relativeness of how it is called a drug , and other people understand what it is to be drug somewhere, like being forced to goto court for example, this is why cops and judges and prosecutors are paid to much, they set the means for the trap up with something you consumed, usually it is tied to animal consumption as they are trapped in conditions of direct paths with little room to do as they please, this is why you see a lot of rich people eating vegan . like me or not this is the truth. prove me wrong.

All you have to do is look at the cosmos, relate it to how we operate as humans, as you will see down to the food we eat being passed on the other lifeforms to then process as well. ",conspiracy,Zodiac
96,The secret of all secrets and mystery of all mysteries. (revision 2),8.0,lcmt5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lcmt5k/the_secret_of_all_secrets_and_mystery_of_all/,14.0,1612464543.0,"In the tradition of Gnostic texts (but without the veil) I name this- The Gospel of Yellowsnow2

.

Immortality, ascension before death, the power to heal, reincarnation, or just spiritual attainment requires full knowledge of the source of life (knowing God). This knowledge has been tightly guarded and used for power and profit for centuries by religions and mystery cults. They milk profit and power while making it unattainable for most all, justified by the notion that THEY must decide and control who is worthy. They have obscured this knowledge in a veil of myths, dogma, and superstition. Rearrange the letters of the word ""veil"".

The most veiled truth of all of history is not taught in school, so first we must cast off the dogma and establish the scientifically experimentally provable reality.

According to modern science, and mostly verified by my own testing, the human body has an outer capacitance of about 100pf. The inner body works mostly by ionic means. An ion is an atom or molecule that has a net electrical charge. The body's electrical circuitry works by ion channels and voltage controlled ion gates. Your thought is actually electrical impulses by neurons. Your mind's focus/attention is the syncing and alignment of your neurons. 

All matter, including your body, is just made of positive energy oscillations called protons and negative energy oscillations called electrons. The only reason you see anything is because the matter resonates at and absorbs the frequency of energy that we name a color.  There is no such thing as ""solid"". All is energy fields and wave interactions. 


We literally live all of our lives inside of electrical fields that we call the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. Venus spins the opposite direction and thus induces the large static capacitance/dielectric field of the ionosphere. For every meter above the ground there is a compounding 100volts of static electric. There is about 200 volts of static electricity at the level of your nose when you stand outside. The air all around is a dielectric substance with a gradient of charge going from zero at the ground to hundreds of thousands of electron volts at the top of the ionosphere. We live on the plate of a giant capacitor in the form of a gas filled tube with mountains being points of increased static energy compression.   

Source for info on the atmospheric energy gradient https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_09.html 

Now that the verifiable reality has been established we can move on. 

The energy that is the source of all life is a form of electrical energy that is induced through this planet by complex planetary interaction and thus time specific (pulsed), which is the reason for holy days. The form of electrical energy that creates life can be focused and accumulated by wave guide resonators and/or multi-layered capacitors. These things have historically been called pyramids, temples, cathedrals, tabernacles, arks, alters, holy of holies, bridal chambers.

The human body is out of tune/alignment or from another perspective the electro-chemical actions of a battery that is slowly draining and running low. All things we eat are dead and thus add to this, some more than others. Our emotional state (E motion) adds to or subtracts from this. Our proximity to the charge states of people and objects induce change in our charge states. What your brain's electrical pulses align to and focus on literally tunes to and quantum entangles with, leading to the transfer of energy from or to the entanglement. These are the reasons for illness and death.

Why was food altered on the alter before eaten all throughout written history? What is eaten, drunk, or applied to the body after being charged/altered inside of the tabernacle/ark/alter/holy of holies? Why is this considered to literally be God that is eaten? Think with reason, not with dogma. God = source of life. Why did Jesus say “One who does not eat my flesh and drink my blood does not have life within.” ?

An ion with a net charge has a measurable polarity. This polarity is either positive/male/Adam or negative/female/Eve and has it's gender exposed to be seen and thus is considered naked. When two ions of similar but opposite charge are brought together by the laws of attraction they together have a net charge of zero and are considered bound/married/wed or in other words it's gender is covered. This is the allegory of Adam and Eve that explains the original sin. Today we use the word ""sine"" wave for a wave that changes polarity.

If you wanted to make the crown of thorns that Jesus wore where would you get it? The genus of trees that have thorns contains the tree that produces the resin called Frankincense. This resin was historically recovered by brutally flaying and stabbing the bark of the tree. Then the tree seems to bleed out of it's wounds the resin that then hardens. Resin is the most positive natural substance on the triboelectric scale and is also used in the alchemical process of making the sacrament. Some of the preparation process may require the substance to be ""crucified"" in a crucible where chemicals are changed by ""crossing"" a threshold of the chemical bonds using heat or PH value. This is the allegory of the crucifixion. 

Do you think those that go to church actually get the real thing or just a symbolic substitute? How is the real thing handled verses the normal church proceeding?

Can hot be known or understood (exist) without cold? Good without evil, positive without negative, up without down? This is the nature of our universe. The division of the 2 and the intelligence of the gradient of change between the 2. These 3 make up the whole, the Trinity. Because all came from one dividing fractally and every whole contains a division, thus the whole truth can seem mirrored and be confusing without this understanding.

All religions, myths, and cults proclaim to contain the same the same thing. Which is the knowledge of life energy, although all completely veil it in allegory. Universal forces, planets, zodiac periods, and the cycles of these are many times anthropomorphized and given names and backstories as gods. This is to veil in allegory the timing of the planetary interactions that the energy of life is transferred to this planet. Many times birds, snakes, bulls/torus, and mountains are allegorically used to represent electric and magnetic fields and forces.  

Many contain stories of immortals who were once human but learned the great knowledge and then used it to rule over the human world. These are also portrayed as gods. These immortals are portrayed to only have this power because of the special food they eat, whether it be golden apples, peaches of immortality, exc.. The ancient Sumerian stories say that after these immortals caused the great flood, or some portray it as being caused by the god of a very long natural cycle, they decided to withdraw from interacting with the human world but still rule over it through the human kings they put in place. They are sometimes called the watchers, Annunaki, Olympians, Asgardians, the Chinese 8 immortals, and other names by different cultural stories, but all seem to refer to the same group of immortals at roughly the same time period.

Who is said to be speaking through the many things historically called an ""oracle"" that is in the holy of holies of every true temple or cathedral? Yes even today the focal point of the building where the sacrament is charged is said to have a voice that talks. Many of the things spoken in ancient times by the Oracle of Delphi are well documented by many witnesses.  Is it truly god or just one of these human immortals on an advanced natural form of radio? 

Why are the kings throughout history always anointed with the sacramental oil and said to be ordained by god? Why do they want to sit on a thrown over top a special rock usually from ancient Greece? What is the purpose of the orb with cross on top and the scepter they are many times pictured holding?

In this age of information is the truth not attainable by he who googles? Are not even the oldest texts written by humans translated to english and available to read on the internet. I have shown you the path and given you the keys to unlock the veil. But remember that some of these cult writings are designed to resonate with something in the human psychology and suck you in.",conspiracy,Zodiac

Because this will come from commonly known conspiracy knowledge concerning complex interconnections, plus thousands of years of history/mythology summarized, it would take thousands of links and a stack of books to source everything mentioned.

If you have questions about something mentioned, and are courteous, you can ask about something specific and I'm sure someone will point you to more resources.

Let's begin The bloodlines:

From the beginning of written history the planet has been ruled by solar monarchies. Usually said to be 12 bloodlines corresponding to the 12 zodiacs, 12 god pantheon, 12 tribes... Or 13 corresponding to the side real zodiac or the lunisolar division. Ophiuchus from the Greek word Ophioukhos—which translates to “serpent-bearer.”

Ancient text and mythology of many time periods says the gods , who seem to be humans with great knowledge that usually gained immortality and powers by eating something special (golden apples, ambrosia, peaches of immortality exc..), or just altered their own genetics, withdrew from directly controlling earth and just appoint human kings as an intermediary ever since the great flood.

That's why the king was always said to be a divine ruler appointed by god and is always corrinated into power by the priest class, usually with the sacramental oil (chrism). Which is the meaning behind ""the king has no robes"" story. The robes corresponding to the chrism and I think is connected to the biblical ""coat of many colours"" of Joseph that implied he would ""assume family leadership"".

Meet your robot body that runs off of ionic energy. Why are we not taught about the ionosphere and ions and the fields we live out entire lives in? Might be a hologram, says the guy made up of nothing but the energy fields of balls of resonance held together by harmonic bonds (protons, neutrons, electrons, atoms, molecules exc...).

Chrism is made from Frankincense tree resin. What type of tree has thorns like the crown of Jesus?

In 1776, often reffed to as “The Unholy Trinity” referenced in the bible, Jesuit Adam Weishaupt and creator of Sabatean Frankism, Jacob Frank, along with the financial help of Amschel Rothschild created the Illuminati. This sect of extremists were driven by a Talmud book called the Zohar which means radiance/illumination. As Weishaupt infiltrated and subverted Freemasonry and the Catholic Church with esoteric and Satanic ideology, Frank did the same with Judaism and Islam - as was started in Turkey with the [Dönmeh through Sabateanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%B6nmeh). 

Using the Illuminati, just as radical groups are used for destabilization by Western Intelligence today, The Rothschilds were able to drive the French Revolution and gain financial leverage over the country. It's said that through devious trading activity the Rothschilds led British investors to think Napoleon won Waterloo allowing them to buy up the bonds the Brits were selling off. In doing this they were able to establishing even stronger family financial dominance. 

George Washington was warned of the “Doctrines of the Illuminati”  and “Principals of Jocobism” (Formed by Jacob Frank’s cousin) in an October 1798 letter from a Reverend G.W. Snyder.  [Washington's reply](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/06-02-02-0435) was that no one was more aware of their activities than him. 

People grew fearful of the masons in the early 1800's once fellow Freemason turned whistleblower, Captain William Morgan, [threatened to expose the secrets of the order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhK0fDIoZ-g&feature=youtu.be&t=1264&ab_channel=DocSpot) as blasphemy, was arrested, and gone missing after a stranger freed him.
 
After multiple attempts of trying to control American finance through central banking, and being thwarted off by Presidents Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln for which was the reason for their attempted and successful assignations, financial powers were able to gain control of American banking on December 24th 1913. This was proceeded by the intentional crashing of Wall Street shortly there after.  From Bolshevism to WW2 and the NAZI party,  the ideological powers behind the Illuminati have been blamed. After WW2, an organization was established to unify the governing nature of the world with the United Nations.  In 1945 America’s OSS was reformed by Allen Dulles as the CIA. President Truman later regretted its creation, [say it was casting a dark shadow on the country by acting on its own accord](http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman%27s%20CIA%20article.html). During Eisenhower’s exit speech he spoke of how we must guard the country against the interests of the [military industrial complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y). Two years later after John F Kennedy spoke about “Fracturing the CIA into a million pieces” and not wanting to press operations in Vietnam or invade Cuba [(this operation involves destroying airplanes as a false flag attack, similar to what 9/11 is accused of being)](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/news/20010430/northwoods.pdf), he was assassinated. 

As the space race introduced a new security risk, it was on his death bed in 1974, as [told by his associate Carol Rosin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ALLUuvsVkM), ex Nazi rocket scientist and chief NASA engineer, Wernher von Braun said that the government will push to build space based weapons and plan to use Russia, terrorism, asteroid, and alien threats as reason for that need.

With over 200 years of war, that include involvement for questionable reasons such as the reasons given for [Germany’s attack of the Lusitania](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/01/lusitania-salvage-warning-munitions-1982), the [admission that no second torpedo was shot in the Gulf of Tonkin](https://youtu.be/HODxnUrFX6k?t=196), the [lack of evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5401gaR7fIk&feature=youtu.be) that justified blame to Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda for 9/11,  [Iraq’s lack of WMDs being found](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7634313/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/cias-final-report-no-wmd-found-iraq/), [power centralized within the US and the UN](https://libertyclassroom.com/warpowers/), violations of the people's rights have eroded. 

Tyranny gained a major foothold on 9/11, when a [secret emergency government was put in place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE2-BR9ameY&ab_channel=sammysmyth2) in America as part of the Continuity of Government. It functions beyond congressional and Federal control, and [has employed domestic and global surveillance networks that monitor all data and communications](https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/17/4517480/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet).  Following 9/11, General Westley Clark made a shocking discovery that America had the intention to [invade seven countries in the following years without reason](https://youtu.be/nUCwCgthp_E?t=123), and that the military’s objectives had moved from defensive to offensive, with the mission to destabilize countries and start wars. This proclamation was eerily similar to [*A Strategy for Israel in the Nineteen Eighties*](http://informationclearinghouse.info/article1025.htm), famously written in 1982 by Oded Yinon and published by the *World Zionist Organization*. The document outlined a strategy to dominate the Middle East identifying Iraq, Syria, and Iran as primary targets.

Iran’s leverage over oil is the lynch pin to offsetting the current power balance in the world and keeping subversive powers from installing a tyrannical world government. The intent of these destabilizing powers are to thwart society and create so much evil and chaos in the world, the people will welcome the saving of it from a Messiah, a Messiah that these powers intend to procure. In doing this they will be the benefactors of a pyramid of power giving them complete global dominance.  This is the real swamp of deep state actors in major governments. The gap in the pyramid on the US dollar is close to being filled, when it is, [this pyramid of power will be unmatched](https://mearone.com/portfolio-item/false-profits/) and protected by the “all seeing eye” of surveillance at its top.",conspiracy,Zodiac

In it I posit that the Synagogue of Satan is constrained by the limits of creation as imposed by the Creator God, YHWH, and so they act as parasites and destroyers rather than creators. I get the feeling from recent discussions in r/conspiracy and r/NewAmericanSystem that Man is made Imago Dei and thus empowered to subdue and be fruitful in his interaction with creation. We are co-creators, as it were, forging reality in our own image: a beautiful thing when we see ourselves as made in self-similarity with God; a horrifying thing when not. Which do you think the Synagogue of Satan champions? Ordo ab Chao.

I wonder if the reason separate cultures going back to the beginning gazed upward and saw the same things is because the human mind is created like a blank book with the chapter titles already set. The pages will be populated with subjectively relevant symbols but the main themes are shared across the globe. One chapter has always been titled ""Man's Place in Cosmos."" Knowing this, the Priest Class accommodated early man's psycho-astral expectation with the zodiac - a way to order earthly events in relation with the cosmos. It was a true metaphor. 

If a population can be united by symbols, one can easily anticipate the development of religious systems comprised of governing mythologies which exist to this day (or these governing mythologies can be completely secular, such as a Materialist worldview). The extent to which these mythologies function as transitional to an individual's conscious awakening (Neo-Platonic Secret Societies) or a culture's subjugation (Neo-Aristotelian Secret Societies) is tied to the Spirit at work among the Priest Class. And again, which do you think the Synagogue of Satan champions?

But I'm interested in the mind's need for certain symbols in the first place. Is it that we are predisposed to gaze at the stars and find something in ourselves? Is this why the Synagogue of Satan populated ancient minds with zodiacs in service to a mere sun-god (Nimrod, Osiris, et al) and today populate our collective mind with talk of Archons as code for various secret societies, so they can operate in the shadows a la Plato's Cave while accommodating everyone's subconscious needs therein? Or why Scientology and Mormonism and New Age all employ a narrative of some alien force? Is this one reason we need the Space Elevator to take root in the popular consciousness, so we can short-circuit the space-based memes of TPTB with one tied to hope?

Fuck, I don't know. But I've got this sun-scorched feeling.",conspiracy,Zodiac

Why does Sept in September mean 7?

Oct in October mean 8?

Dec in December mean 10?

Where did April Fool's Day originate? 

Just watched an interesting video that explains that pre Julian and Gregorian calendars of old had 13 months of 28 days with one extra day in each year. And that day....was New Year's day. Those Calendars began in the spring, and not in January.

In fact, when they switched it, some people still went on the d calender, were called fools, and hence... April Fool's Day. 

Much like the altering of the tuning standard from 432 hz took us off the natural frequency, it appears this too throws our biorhythm into an unnatural state. 


This calendar is very similar to the Mayan calendar. 
In fact, Ethiopia is one of the only places that still run on a 13  month calendar. Putting them 7 years behind. 

The most interesting fact I learned, was that there are actually 13 zodiac signs. The 13th sign is Ophiuchus, anthropomorphized as a man with a serpent around his waist. 

Ophiuchus is the only one not counted as a zodiac sign, even though it falls in the belt. Ophiuchus is represented by a man with a serpent around his waist. He is thought to represent the Greek God of Health and Medicine: Asclepius.

His image is also thought to represent the image of Adam in battle with the Serpent/Satan. (How appropriate) 

Which could also shed some light on superstitions surrounding this Zodiac sign and why it is not in use. It is tied to the idea of cataclysm and pole shifts. 

 Whatever the reason, at some point in history an extra month was omitted by government and religious leaders and the world forgot.


I'm a bit late, or perhaps just in the nick of time. Happy New Year!

I have taken an interest in numerology over the last few years, and I am on the ""7"" path, for anyone who cares (the 7 path being a questioning/spiritual path). Anyways. Let me just get to the point:

I believe that something in our society's dynamics/fabrics seems to become misaligned every 12 years. I think it's never been more obvious just how ""off"" this year has been compared to other years, and it is not just because of the election. I think the significance of the number 12 gets overlooked compared to 13, etc. but the number 12 has played an important part as the number of biblical disciples, the zodiac signs, the Chinese zodiac signs, the months of the year, etc. 

Here's my quick summary of important events (at a gap of 12 years each) which seemed to have shifted the global consciousness towards different directions upon occurrence: 

**2016**-Obvious super shitty election. Global warming potentially irreversible. Inevitable TPP passage overriding any remaining Constitutional powers. Race riots revitalized in struggling communities. The next phases of the civil rights/native american rights, feminist movement, gay rights movement, anti-establishment movement, alt-right movement, etc. advance. Baby boomer generation begins to die off, still making decisions young people will face the consequences for. Scores of creative influences and athletic superstars die. People challenging the credibility of certain words, phrases, etc. Income inequality, poverty rampant.

**2004**-Iraq & Afghanistan War On Terror in full swing. The tsunami in Southeast Asia killing hundreds of thousands of people. Birth of social media with founding of Facebook, Gmail. Artists questioning ""Where is the love""?

**1992**-Bill Clinton elected, beginning a new age of neoliberalism. Race riots revitalized in struggling communities. People challenging the credibility of words, phrases, etc. (regarding obscenity in music). Gen X finally takes the spotlight away from the Baby Boomers. Internet begins to form.

**1980**-Fundamentalist Muslims take over Middle Eastern region (With previous American backing), sparking the rise of terrorism ever since. Ronald Reagan elected, beginning a new age of (neo)conservatism/religious conservatism, in successful critical election. Scores of creative influences die. HIV/AIDS crisis soon impacts gay community. 

**1968**-Unprecedented social upheaval in American society. Assassinations of MLK & RFK leave bigger rift between young and old squares back then. Also very shitty election cycle. Race riots revitalized in struggling communities all over the U.S. The next phases of the civil rights/native american rights, feminist movement, gay rights movement, antiwar movement, hippie movement, etc. advanced. Income inequality, poverty rampant.

**1956**-Honestly, I can't think of anything gloomy from this year, besides it being the height of the Cold War.

**1944**-Height of WWII, D-day, fascist power, lowest point for then-ally Soviet Union. Nuclear weapon development imminent. Race riots revitalized in struggling communities.

**1932**-Lowest and most bleak year of the Great Depression. Income inequality, poverty rampant. Dust Bowl begins, making it part of the ""Dirty Thirties"". People challenging the credibility of certain words, phrases, gestures, etc. (Implementation of the Hollywood Code aka early censorship) FDR soon to be elected, changing the role of the Presidency in the economy and in wartime. Hitler also rises to power because of rampant income inequality, poverty from WWI.

**1920**-Start of the Roaring Twenties. Income inequality, poverty rampant. Immediately after the ""War to end all wars"". Radio invented.

**1860**-Abraham Lincoln elected, forever altering the role of the President in leading the U.S...also helps form one of the two major political parties today. Civil War ensues. Race riots revitalized in struggling communities. The topic of slavery reaches societal boiling point. 

**1848**-Mexican American War/Manifest Destiny in full swing. Also the start of the California Gold Rush.

**1824**-Controversial presidential election after the ""Virginia Dynasty"" of Republican two term presidents Jefferson, Madison, Monroe. Then candidate claims ""corrupt bargain"", forms one of the two major political parties. Monroe Doctrine begins to take place. 

**1812**-The War of 1812, tests U.S ability to remain a free country.

**1800**-Controversial presidential election cycle, leads to Jefferson's ""Revolution of 1800"", altering the way leaders are (s)elected. Napoleon Bonaparte rises to power. 

**1788**-George Washington becomes the first president of the newly created United States. Constitution created and ratified. 

**1776**-The REVOLUTION and founding of the U.S.

and so on and so on.

My simple question is, does anyone else feel like there is some sort of weird connection to these similar events taking place every 12 years? I'm still quite young so maybe I could be naive or gullible. Sorry if this isn't worded too good either, I'm up at 2 AM thinking about all this..

He finds that the event is also associated with an increase of ammonium, oxylate, and formate ion, which is indicative of a period of global biomass combustion.

Today I would like to talk about the rebirth cycles on this planet. This is hard to understand how it works and if it is true considering all the controversal infromation.

However, it is actually so, we do rebirth and there is an algorhitm for that. Some people say that you rebirth until you learn the lesson or infinitely or that you live once, that's all maximum and minimum which are not true. I keep mentioning everywhere that mathematics and scientists do not invent anything they only find and deepen their learning into something what is already here. Mathematics is science of understanding how this material world works in universal language.

Getting to the point - you rebirth 12 times according to cycle of zodiac. Your sould goes through full cycle of experiences. And only once you complete this cycle you will finish you lesson in this place if we ignore any other short-routes which are not for everyone.

This message is intended for those who know about Saturn, El, Ouroboros, Cycles of time, and basic law of reason and outcome.

If you only know about signs of zodiac in some modern popular literature then you may skip this message as you are not there yet. You will get there. It is just too soon.

This happens on micro level of every soul - 12 rebirth to get the lesson. On macro level - it is ages. Currently this planet as a transcedental being goes into age of auarius out of age of piesces. Once it finishes the circle of zodiacal ages the planet as we know it today will end.

I post it here only to share knowledge, I am not a scientist nor an insider nor an educated person. I am the common folk, I do not have anything material to lose as I've never had any.

The Skull and Bones secret society at Yale is a branch of the Cult of Mars and uses the number 322 as its symbol. Skull and Bones is a military death cult ran by the Bush family and that is why both George Bush Sr. and George Bush Jr. are members and they caused the Gulf War, Afghanistan War, and Iraq War. During the Aries Zodiac many massacres, explosions, and disasters occurred along with other events especially related to war and destruction. The OK City Bombing, Waco Massacre, Columbine Massacre, NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Happy Land Fire, Mont Blanc Tunnel Fire, Exxon Valdez oil spill, Deepwater Horizon Explosion, Capitol Hill Massacre in Seattle, Virginia Tech shooting, Boston Bombings, West Fertilizer Company explosion, Sloterdijk Train Collision, 2014 Katanga train derailment, USAir Flight 405 crash, Germanwings Flight 9525 crash, and the Brussels Bombings occurred during or right after the Aries Zodiac. Mars the ""Red Planet"" symbolizes fire, war, and anger. Holocaust means a wholly burnt offering. The Aryan Nazis worship Ares.
 

Military Auxiliary Radio System or MARS is a communications program developed by the Department of Defense which run drills and had one under the name Gotham Shield on April 24-25 of 2017 right at the end of the Aries Zodiac as preparation for an engineered EMP attack. Amateur Radio Emergency Service or ARES is an organization also involved in emergency communications and was involved in this drill. These two organizations are controlled by the Cult of Mars. The Rothschild's first bank was called Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Sons which is an acronym for MARS. Mars is called the Red Planet. The name Rothschild means Red Shield and they shield the Vatican, House of Windsor, and the Cult of Mars. The Rothschild family and other Zio-Nazi clans like the Mars family who are worth over 70 billion practice Kabbalah and use mass media mind control and food and drug chemical warfare as a weapon against humanity to guard the monarchs. David Mayer de Rothschild can be seen wearing the ""red string"" Kabbalah bracelet which is a symbol for Mars and  the red Gevurah. Top members of the Cult of Mars include Prince Stefano Massimo, Prince Carlo Massimo, Prince Harry Windsor, John Franklyn Mars, ""Red"" Baron David Rene de Rothschild, David Mayer de Rothschild and Evelyn de Rothschild.

What if the Holy Bible is true? What would that mean? Most importantly, it would mean that Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior of Mankind, changing absolutely everything when he became the Messiah, who took on death itself and died for our sins. However, it would also mean that demons are equally as real as our Lord and Savior, of which they will do everything and anything in their power to prevent you from Knowing this profound Truth. It would mean that anyone who rejects the Truth of Jesus Christ does not have the Holy Spirit in them, and thenceforth can not be trusted in interpreting the Holy Bible truthfully, because of demonic possession either known or unknown. It would mean that numerous pagan deities actually exist who, in both the past and present day, are worshiped. It would mean that the Book of Revelation is real, important figures such as the Antichrist and False Prophet exist, and one day Jesus will return. The Truth in the Holy Bible should accurately explain our **Supernatural** world, the reasons people behave when confronted with such Truth, with everything pointing back to the Messiah figure. This includes what he’s gone through to claim the title, and an active agenda to remove his status from the antagonist, whom I’m sure isn’t proud of his accomplishments. I will be focusing on this Observable Truth for the rest of this post. This is the [Game of Thrones](http://bit.ly/2vbKJl1).

#The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything

If the Holy Bible is True, when actively looking for the *Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything* we should eventually find Jesus. Remembering that demons are equally as real as our Lord and Savior, it might be difficult to see how an answer such as 42 could possibly have anything to do with the Holy Bible. I don’t think anyone can disagree that [The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything is 42](http://bit.ly/1hrK3fv), so from this point forward I will treat it as an Observable Truth. Where people’s opinions might differ is what this means **Esoterically**. The Exoteric view of 42 is just that, a number. However when we view this Observable Truth from an Esoteric point of view, that is, “*intended for or likely to be understood by only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge or interest*” we get an entirely different importance and meaning to the number. There’s a nice section on Wikipedia regarding the importance of this number in relation to religion [Here](http://bit.ly/2vbNp1K). I'd like to stress what this page says regarding Kabbalistic tradition. *42 is the number with which God creates the Universe in Kabbalistic tradition*.  I’d also like to stress the importance this number has in Pop Culture, as well as 42 being the **Angle For Which a Rainbow Appears**, also mentioned on this page. For further analysis on The Answer to Life, The Universe, and Everything, including an increased **Esoteric View** of what this number could mean, Observe the references from Pop Culture I have found [Here](http://bit.ly/2vchEFS) *Demonstrating the Truth of this information*.

#Tesla’s Key to the Universe

Similarly, if the Holy Bible is True, when looking for the Key to the Universe we should eventually find Jesus. Though there might be some differing opinions in taking the words of a serbian-American inventor as the truth, here I will be focusing on the **Esoteric** meaning behind this statement, and what he could’ve possibly meant by saying “[If you only knew the magnificence of the 3 6 and 9 then you would have a key to the universe](http://bit.ly/2cWg9Bi).”

To do this I will be looking at topics involving Alchemy, and the Planetary Correspondences on the [Kabbalistic Tree](https://imgur.com/OyxyiBl).

The following Information comes from the Kabbalah (including source links for future research, not everything is included here). Later in this post you will find more Observations from Pop Culture **Demonstrating the Truth of this Detailed, but Specific Information**.

* 1) [Kether, The Crown, Metatron - He Who Is Visiting The Throne, Completion of the Great Work, Diamond](http://bit.ly/2uPKr1u)

* 2) [Chokmah, Wisdom, The Zodiac, Man](http://bit.ly/2wDpZD3)

* 3) [Binah, Understanding, Saturn, Lead, Whale, Silence, Rest, Woman](http://bit.ly/2uPKryw)

* 6) [Tipareth, Beauty, Sun, Gold, Lion, Phoenix, Child, Ra, Apollo](http://bit.ly/2vsu666)

* 7) [Netzache, Victory, Venus, Rose](http://bit.ly/2vseeRc)

* 10) [Malkuth, The Kingdom, Earth, Lilith, Rabbit](http://bit.ly/2vsejEu)

Focusing on the words of Nikola Tesla, it is possible that what he meant by disclosing the magnificence of the 3 6 and 9 has something to do with Saturn (3), The Sun (6), and The Moon (9) and how they are presented within the Kabbalah along with the information of each respectively. Of course we shouldn’t ignore the other Sefirot within the Tree, but to fully understand what Tesla could have meant we should isolate these three, and see what they could mean.

#(3) Saturn, Lead, Whale, Silence, Rest, Woman

Remarkably, Saturn has a [Hexagon](http://bit.ly/2lh5yZq) on its North Pole, and an [Eye](https://go.nasa.gov/2vDmTAO) on its South Pole. These Observations are exactly like they sound. Nobody can debate whether or not Saturn does in fact have a Hexagon on its North Pole and an Eye on its South Pole. It is, very bluntly, a truthful statement. Exactly as true in saying that [Hexagons and Cubes](http://bit.ly/2v9HFYj) are visually similar. As you can see, **Esoterically** speaking, Hexagons and Cubes could both represent the planet Saturn. One being a giant storm cloud on its North Pole, the other being derived from the shape itself.

You can find numerous places to research this topic with a Google search of [Saturn Hexagon and Cube](http://bit.ly/2vYHAs4), and I’m sure you will find that Muslims do in fact Worship Saturn in the form of a Black Cube in Mecca called the [Kaaba](http://bit.ly/2vZHkbc). From this point forward, it should be noted that Muslims do not worship the God of the Holy Bible, as the Kaaba is quite plainly an Idol to Saturn, and the God of the Holy Bible forbids Idols. Also, modern day Judaism has been equally as deceived into Saturn worship with the inclusion of an object known as a [Tefillin](http://bit.ly/2wDELtl), which is a Black Cube worn by male observant Jews during weekday morning prayers, as well as a widely known iconic Symbol with a Hexagon/Cube in the Center known as the [Star of David](http://bit.ly/1Wrcxv3), [Star of Remphan](http://bit.ly/2wknvJA), or [Seal of Solomon](http://bit.ly/2wxuFcx). Finally, if the Holy Bible is true, there are “Jews who say they’re Jews but are from the Synagogue of Satan” supporting the claim not all Jews worship the same god. If you have trouble accepting these Observations regarding the religions of the world, I suggest reading the opening paragraph of this post again.

From the Information in the Kabbalah, we learned that Saturn (3) is also represented in the form of a **Whale**. Interestingly, Jonah went into the Belly of a Whale for three days and three nights in the Holy Bible, the *Exact Number of Days as Saturn is on the Kabbalah*. Also, and more importantly, Jesus once said “A wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.”

If the Holy Bible is True, these words are true, because they came from the very thing claimed to be true. You can find more Observations from Pop Culture regarding [Saturn the Planet](http://bit.ly/2fk1eHV), [Saturn’s Hexagon](http://bit.ly/2uwizzh), [Cubes](http://bit.ly/2vubQdw), [Whales](http://bit.ly/2vCXmYv) and the [Whale's Belly](http://bit.ly/2udEY53) at the links provided.

Saturn is also known as the [Grim Reaper, or Father Time](http://bit.ly/2ueoycs). You can find many [Examples](http://bit.ly/2uwPtQ5) of these mythological characters in Pop Culture at the link provided. The [Seal Of Saturn](http://bit.ly/2wxj3Xd) looks like Two X’s next to each other. Here are [Examples](http://bit.ly/2wk4tTN) of this from Pop Culture. An [X Mark](http://bit.ly/2ugbtDF) is also known as a [Cross](http://bit.ly/2uwQG9Y). You can find many [Examples](http://bit.ly/2ue84kJ) of this shape from Pop Culture.

If the Holy Bible is True, Jesus died on a Cross (also known as an X Mark) in between Two Other Crosses (Possibly this could be the Seal of Saturn, or Two X's described above).

With the possibility that Tesla’s Key to the Universe has something to do with Alchemy, and the Planetary Correspondences on the Kabbalistic Tree, any Information or Logical Observation from the context of the Kabbalah should be held accountable.

[The Moon (9) Impregnation was from Man (2) Woman (3) Child (6) in ‘69](http://bit.ly/2v9uAho)

#(6) Sun, Gold, Lion, Phoenix, Ra, Apollo, Child

If the Holy Bible is True, the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. However, if the Holy Bible is True, Jesus is also known as the Lion of Judah. It is possible that the **Esoteric** view of *The Sun, Lion, and Phoenix* represent the Antichrist, that is the *Opposite of Christ*. He can be viewed as the *Redeeming Figure* who *Mocks and Inverts* the True Christ by going through a *Death and Rebirth*, undoing the accomplishments of the *Messiah*, attempting to claim the *Throne of Our Lord*. Observations from Narnia come into mind here, with Aslan going through a [Death](http://bit.ly/2wj5yO7) and [Resurrection](http://bit.ly/2ibay1t), or the [Phoenix](http://bit.ly/2vLKr4I) from Harry Potter (The Chosen One who chose to Sacrifice Himself) which suddenly bursts into flames and is Reborn from the Ashes. As stated above, if the Holy Bible is True, Everything should point back to the *Messiah Figure*. Here is another [Example](http://bit.ly/2x95v4e). Notice how Conchita Wurst has both Feminine and Masculine traits. Here are more *Observations* from Pop Culture regarding [The Sun](http://bit.ly/2vCSDWz), [Lions](http://bit.ly/2wx0DFR), and [Phoenixes](http://bit.ly/2hzNs4y).

In Hebrew the meaning of the name Samson is: [Sun Child](http://bit.ly/2uwAFRs). In Egyptian the meaning of the name Ramses is: [Begotten by Ra the Sun god](http://bit.ly/2hA1tiJ). If the Holy Bible is True, Both these people have existed. If the Holy Bible True, Nimrod - The Mighty Hunter, Son and Husband to Semiramis, also existed. [Orion](http://bit.ly/2v9OWqW) is also known to be a Mighty Hunter, usually accompanied by [Sirius](http://bit.ly/2i9jxQT), the Dog Star. Possibly Nimrod and Orion share similar backgrounds.

> More Information on the Babylonian Mystery School Religions is needed to understand the connection of [Nimrod and Sun deities](http://bit.ly/2uxW4yw), along with the [Mother Child Worship](http://bit.ly/2fTm6Wt) of Isis and Horus. Note: [Semiramis taught that Tammuz was Nimrod Reincarnated](http://bit.ly/2vD5lEX). A good visualization of both Nimrod and Semiramis from Pop Culture can be found [Here](http://bit.ly/1Xx6m51).

Here are some *Observations* from Pop Culture involving [Mighty Hunters](http://bit.ly/2vEuv72), and both [Orion and Sirius](http://bit.ly/2vuXtWs), with an *Esoteric* view of [Osiris, the Green Man](http://bit.ly/2uwDaDy) [Here](http://bit.ly/2ugaaEP)

*These Observations should be seen in the context of the information above. If the Holy Bible is True, when looking for the Key to the Universe we should eventually find Jesus.

#(9) Moon, Silver, Diana, Elephant

If the Holy Bible is True, a silversmith once made silver shrines for Artemis, also known as Diana. If the Holy Bible is True, Semiramis - Mother and Wife of Nimrod existed. If the Holy Bible is True, the Queen Of Heaven, also known as [Hera](http://bit.ly/2fALnF1), can not forgive sins. This Information goes very much unnoticed from the Roman Catholic Church where they go as far as call Mary the [Queen Of Heaven](http://bit.ly/2hzdYuP), proudly promote Mother Child Worship, and actively push for a One World Religion. [Example](http://bit.ly/2wUIFyi), [Example](http://bit.ly/2x8NvHr). That is something the False Prophet would do.

#What Tesla could’ve meant

As stated above, if the Holy Bible is True, when looking for the Key to the Universe we should eventually find Jesus. Though there might be some differing opinions in taking the words of a serbian-American inventor as the truth, here I will be focusing on the **Esoteric** meaning behind this statement, and what Tesla could’ve possibly meant by saying “[If you only knew the magnificence of the 3 6 and 9 then you would have a key to the universe](http://bit.ly/2cWg9Bi).”

By using the Information collected, which comes from the Kabbalah, we know:

3) Saturn, Lead

6) Sun, Gold

9) Moon, Silver

**[Alchemy](http://bit.ly/2hUvF8t)** - the medieval forerunner of chemistry, based on the supposed transformation of matter. It was concerned particularly with attempts to **convert base metals into gold or to find a universal elixir**.

Possibly, what Tesla meant has something to do with turning Base Metals such as [Lead into Gold](http://bit.ly/2v9SgCj). Additionally, if we look at the Yin Yang Symbol, it is usually depicted using the [Sun (6) and Moon (9)](http://bit.ly/2v9QWQ7), which is [Gold (6) and Silver (9)](http://bit.ly/2uM47YU), or [Fire and Water/Ice](http://bit.ly/2uZN8y1). *Observations* from Pop Culture regarding [Alchemy](http://bit.ly/2wkwMS2), the [Yin Yang Symbol](http://bit.ly/2vD0L9N), and [Fire and Water/Ice](http://bit.ly/2fk3H5b) can be found at the provided links. It's interesting there's a book from the Game of Thrones series on this.

[**The Moon (9)** Landing was from **Man (2) Woman (3) Child (6) in ‘69**](http://bit.ly/2v9uAho)

[**Princess Diana’s (9) Funeral** was on the **6th day of the 9th month**](http://bit.ly/2hAlQwh)

**[Apollo (6) and Diana (9) are Twins](http://bit.ly/2vsv3eM)**

[**The Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki** happened on the **6th and the 9th day of the 8th month**](http://bit.ly/2udSENg)

[**The Numbers 6 and 9 make an 8** when layered on top of each other](http://bit.ly/2wS0tJh)

**[The Number 3 and a Backwards Number 3 look like an 8](http://bit.ly/2vYNnOf) when layered besides one another. Two Threes (one being reversed are needed to make this happen)**

[This](http://bit.ly/2vHIqbi) is **Spider-Man** fighting **[dOCTor](http://bit.ly/2uR3Yn6) Octopus**, both of which have **8 legs**

[The **number 8 and the Infinity Symbol** are identical, only rotated 90 degrees](http://bit.ly/2wxx5rJ)

[**Jack** learned **Octagons have 8 sides**](http://bit.ly/2wXgS0c)

[**CERN’s LHC** is an **Octagon**](http://bit.ly/2vEWpzP)

The Movie [Moon has a Poster with a guy coming through an Octagon](http://bit.ly/2fNeCnU)

[An Octagon is the petrie polygon of a **Tesseract, or a Cube Within a Cube**](http://bit.ly/1kY3lyR). **The Symbol on [Israel's Flag is a Cube Within a Cube](http://bit.ly/2xcHAB3)**

It is Possible CERN is the Moongate Door, or the [**Tesseract Power Source** from The Avengers](http://bit.ly/2vMsgxq)

[The **Aperture Science** Logo is an Octagon, Aperture is defined as an Opening](http://bit.ly/2x7ZvJ4)

[This is an Exit Sign](http://bit.ly/2vuPt7O)

[Heaven is For Real](http://bit.ly/2vP3Q76), is the [Moon-Gate Door real](http://bit.ly/2vYGgoL)?

The **[Wheel Of Dharma](http://bit.ly/2ugESxo)** is an 8 spoked Wheel

It is possible that **CERN** is the **Wheel Of Dharma**, teaching the **Path to Nirvana**, or a [Return to Eden](http://bit.ly/2ugvYAc). This can be a possibility as **Both the LHC and the Wheel Of Dharma are 8 sided shapes** (8 being the **Infinity symbol** rotated, as well as the **numbers 6 and 9** layered on top of each other).

In Buddhism [Avicii](http://bit.ly/2vuPb0H) means the lowest level of Hell. [It is said to be a cube](http://bit.ly/1wzp7GI). It can be said that by leaving Avicii (Hell) and entering Nirvana (Eden) one would have [escaped a prison](http://bit.ly/2vvsFES), that prison being Hell. An example of this can be seen in Pop Culture from the [Ending Of the Truman Show](http://bit.ly/2w77hGs), similarities can be drawn from the [ending of the movie The Signal](http://bit.ly/2x95vkV). The origin of the word **[Matrix comes from Womb](http://bit.ly/2vE5nfj), [In Utero is defined as in a woman's uterus; before birth](http://bit.ly/2fPm2Hb)**, it is also an album by the band Nirvana.

[**The Numbers 6 and 9 make a Chain Link** when layered on top of each other](http://bit.ly/2wS0tJh)

If the Holy Bible is True, Jesus breaks away our chains

*These Observations should be seen in the context of the information above. If the Holy Bible is True, when looking for the Key to the Universe we should eventually find Jesus. With the possibility that Tesla’s Key to the Universe has something to do with Alchemy, and the Planetary Correspondences on the Kabbalistic Tree, any Information or Logical Observation from the context of the Kabbalah should be held accountable. This includes things seen in Pop Culture, as this is actively demonstrating the truth of the information in question*.

#Elixir Of Life

**[Alchemy](http://bit.ly/2hUvF8t)** - the medieval forerunner of chemistry, based on the supposed transformation of matter. It was concerned particularly with **attempts to convert base metals into gold or to find a universal elixir**.

**[The Elixir of Life](http://bit.ly/2ka0Cle)**, also known as elixir of immortality and sometimes equated with the philosopher's stone, is a mythical potion that supposedly grants the drinker **Eternal Life and/or eternal youth**.

**[The ""Holy"" Grail](http://bit.ly/2gtNLtp)** is a vessel that serves as an important motif in Arthurian literature. Different traditions describe it as a cup, dish or stone with miraculous powers that provide happiness, **eternal youth or sustenance in infinite abundance**.

If the Holy Bible is True, Jesus drank from a cup and then offered that cup, along with some bread, to his followers

[This](http://bit.ly/2vHPAvZ) is an Observation, informing the viewer that the ""Holy"" Grail is in the Castle Of Aughhh. You can find other places the ""Holy"" Grail reveals itself in Pop Culture by looking [Here](http://bit.ly/2uxg0g9), and [Here](http://bit.ly/2uwU30A) are Observations regarding either eating or drinking of food (Strikingly similar to the way Jesus did, If the Bible was True). [Narnia](http://bit.ly/2x8SoQK) once again shows a good example of this Observation.

**[Man (2), Woman (3), Child (6), Foundation (9), and Kingdom (10) make a shape similar to that of a cup when looking at the Kabbalistic Tree, with the inclusion of The Crown (1), we see a Sword. Excalibur](http://bit.ly/2vYJedb)**.

#Room 101, Pillars of Mercy and Severity (Boaz and Jachin)

[The Pillar of Mercy Is found on the right hand side of the Tree of Life, while the Pillar of Severity lies on the left hand side](http://bit.ly/2uy1qKg). It is possible that the Two Pillars of Mercy and Severity, or Boaz and Jachin, could be [Red and Blue](http://bit.ly/2v9eQuO) respectively. [More Information](http://bit.ly/2v5YhwK). If the Holy Bible is True, Samson - [Sun Child](http://bit.ly/2uwAFRs) destroyed Two Pillars with the strength he got from his hair, forthcoming to the arrival of the *Messiah*.

The events of *9/11* happened, where the **Twin Towers (Closely Resembling Pillars)** were destroyed. This is strikingly similar *almost like a Mirrored Inversion* to what could’ve happened once before, if the events in the Holy Bible were True. Multiple examples of the Twin Towers being destroyed, or other significance with **The Numbers 9 ([IX in Roman Numerals](http://bit.ly/2uAdgj3)) and 11 ([XI in Roman Numerals](http://bit.ly/2w0gz6v))** together, have been observed from Pop Culture, some of which I have collected [here](http://bit.ly/2uxDDKz).

**IXXI** visually looks like the Seal of Saturn (previously noted above as **[Two X’s](http://bit.ly/2wxj3Xd)** or the two X-marks on either side of Jesus as he was Crucified, If the Bible was True) surrounded by **Two Pillars** (Previously Noted Above as being destroyed by Samson - [Sun Child](http://bit.ly/2uwAFRs), if the Bible was True, which has also been mirrored on the events of **9/11 or IX and XI in Roman Numerals**).

#Possible Proof the Freemasons were behind the Attacks on 9/11

[This](http://bit.ly/2v9PehE) is the Freemason Logo. It is a Letter G, [The 7th letter of the Alphabet](http://bit.ly/2kcQ9Xd), surrounded by a Square and Compass, of which make Two X's, or the Seal of Saturn, in between Two Pillars, making IXXI Visually. One Pillar has a Sun (6) nearby, while the other Pillar has a Moon (9). There is an Eye in the Center, acting as the 13th Pillar, or the 'Middle Pillar'. [This](http://bit.ly/1HMsbVc) is a video of Building 7 being destroyed, on the same day and same place, the **Twin Towers (Closely Resembling Pillars)** were also destroyed.

It could be possible the Freemason Square and Compass represents Saturn, being identified as a planet with Rings, as a Compass makes Circles, and having a Hexagon/Cube/Square on it’s North Pole (as shown Above). [This](http://bit.ly/2vN2pU6) says Freemasons run the country. It is possible that Freemasons run the country, as stated in this cartoon.

#13th Pillar, 'Middle Pillar'

[The Pillar of Balance is the 'middle pillar' which runs up the centre of the Tree](http://bit.ly/2uy1qKg). There is a 13 near the top of the ‘middle pillar’ of the Kabbalah, which you can clearly observe [Here](http://bit.ly/2vYJedb). The One World Trade Center [replaced the North and South Towers](http://bit.ly/2fjHUKA), and could potentially represent the Middle Pillar. It is possible that the middle pillar could be [purple](http://bit.ly/2v9WLNf), that is the collision of the potentially Red and Blue pillars, Boaz and Jachin. It is possible that this represents the [unification of the genders](http://bit.ly/2vc8V6V), as Baphomet has both (.)(.) and 8=D, shown above with Conchita Wurst as the Phoenix Rising out of the Ashes.

If the Holy Bible is True, Jesus was the 13th, among his 12 disciples. [Here](http://bit.ly/2v9r0nq) you can observe numerous examples of a primary figure standing clearly in the middle of Two Pillars, of which was previously stated as the Pillars Of Mercy and Severity, Boaz and Jachin. It is possible the characters portrayed in between these Pillars could represent the middle pillar, the one with a 13 near the top, or the Antichrist. That is the opposite of Christ, the redeeming figure who *Mocks and Inverts the True Christ*, who was the 13th among his 12 disciples.

#Conclusion

The Information in the Kabbalistic Tree, along with an agenda to destroy and rebuild the design within the Tree itself, can be supported with Observations from Pop Culture, along with Observations in the Materialistic world surrounding the events of 9/11, The Moon Landing, and what is currently taking place at CERN.

and most importantly, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ is the True Jewish Messiah who offers us a cup, the Inversion being the [""Holy"" Grail](http://bit.ly/2uxg0g9), **[Man (2), Woman (3), Child (6), Foundation (9), and Kingdom (10) on the Kabbalistic Tree](http://bit.ly/2vYJedb)**, or Eternal Life through [Transhumanism](http://bit.ly/2wofEwZ), a **[Metamorphosis](http://bit.ly/2vJGhtY)** or [Supernatural Change](http://bit.ly/2xcjJBz). Jesus humbly sacrificed himself on a [Cross](http://bit.ly/2uwQG9Y) in between two other x marks, previously mentioned as the [Seal Of Saturn](http://bit.ly/2wxj3Xd), during which the [Sun went Black](http://bit.ly/2va8A67), and the [Veil of Space Time](http://bit.ly/2vDvgwj) ripped. Jesus Christ destroyed the design within the Kabbalistic Tree, by cutting it down at the Foundation (Yesod) with his [carpenter power of awesome](http://bit.ly/2vcpD5V). Jesus entered a [Tomb](http://bit.ly/2vveaRp) for Three days, just as Jonah did with the Whale (Saturn, 3), before defeating death itself as he rose from the dead.

The Inversion of this can partially be seen from the events of 9/11, where we see a parallel between the [Twin Towers being destroyed and replaced with the One World Trade Center](http://bit.ly/2fjHUKA) and the the Pillars of Mercy and Severity, or Boaz and Jachin, Samson - [Sun Child](http://bit.ly/2uwAFRs) already destroyed. The False Messiah, being the opposite of Christ, can be represented as the Middle Pillar, also called the 13th Pillar. The remaining events are clearly prophesied in the Book of Revelation, which are to take place using CERN’s LHC (in reference to Shiva the Destroyer and Revelation 9/11) where the goal is to destroy and rebuild the design laid out in the Kabbalah. By using the [Wheel Of Dharma](http://bit.ly/2ugESxo), the antagonist of the Holy Bible is trying to Invert and Undo the accomplishment of Jesus Christ, becoming his own carpenter and cutting down his own design within the Tree itself.

THE AURORA

Every reader of this book has heard of the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis, or Southern Lights. Some readers may have visited Norway and gone far enough to catch a glimpse of this mysterious phenomenon. We say mysterious because scientists have never been able to explain it, although they usually try to do so by saying something indefinite about the earth's electricity and magnetism. We claim, on the basis of our theory, to explain definitely what causes the auroral lights: that the central sun, flashing its beams through the polar openings, is the cause. To enforce this claim we shall first describe. in the words of competent observers, just what these lights look like and how they behave. We shall then show--also on the best scientific evidence--that they are not and could not be caused by electricity or magnetism; we shall refute many fallacies on that subject. And then we shall give abundant evidence proving that the reflection of the rays of the central sun by the earth's atmosphere, modified by the conditions, cloudy or otherwise, of the atmosphere of the interior of the earth, is what causes these wonderful displays of light.

WHAT THE AURORA LOOKS LIKE

We shall have more than one description of the aurora in the following chapter, but perhaps it will be interesting to start our enquiry from a rather old but very good book to which we have referred before. In Honorable Daines Barrington's ""Possibility of Approaching the North Pole"" he asks a correspondent about the aurora and is assured that it ""is commonly seen most strong in the north and is very red and fiery.""

IS IT CONTINUOUS?

Greely in his ""Three Years of Arctic Service"" says a number of interesting things. He remarks that there is always a feeble auroral light even when there is not a brilliant display. Soon after that remark we find him observing a perfectly circular aurora which he calls a mock sun. It had burning colors of blue, yellow and red with bars of white. A few days after, he witnessed an aurora which had a beautiful corona or crown of light around it. It had numerous and brilliant streamers. Then here is another description of an aurora:

""A beautiful and brilliant arch about three degrees wide, formed of twisted, convoluted bands of light, similar to twisted ribbons, extended from the south-west through the zenith to the north-eastern horizon. Occasionally, well-marked and clearly defined patches of light detached themselves, as puffs of smoke from a pipe, and drifted fading to the northwest.

The arch seemed to be continually renewing itself from the southwest to fade at the opposite end. Perhaps a better idea of this peculiar formation may be conveyed by likening the display to an arch having the appearance of an endless, revolving screw. This formation was by no means infrequent, but I have never seen it elsewhere or known it to be described.""

Again Greely writes:

""A particularly fine aurora, like a pillar of glowing fire, from horizon to horizon through the zenith, showing at times a decidedly rosy tint.""

It will at once strike the reader how well these observations fit in with our theory that the aurora is the reflection of the beams of the inner sun coming through the polar orifice, when he remembers the extraordinary differences there will be in the conditions which from time to time modify those reflections. There may be clouds between the inner sun and the polar orifice, and these may be diffused or in heavy dense masses. The atmosphere may be moister or dryer at one time than another and this will modify the reflections. The earth's outer atmosphere may vary as well as its inner one. Hence all the differences which are described in the succeeding pages.

NANSEN DESCRIBES AURORA

Let us now take the testimony of Fridtjof Nansen on the subject of the aurora. In ""Farthest North"" he describes many appearances of this marvel. Here is part of one of his descriptions:

""A lovely aurora this evening. A brilliant corona encircled the zenith with a wreath of streamers in several layers, one outside the other; then larger and smaller sheaves of streamers over the sky. . . . . . . All of them, however, tended upward toward the corona, which shone like a halo. Every now and then I could discern a dark patch in its middle, at the point where all the rays converged. It lay a little south of the pole star, and approached Cassiopeia in the position it then occupied. But the halo kept smouldering and shifting just as if a gale in the upper strata of the atmosphere were playing the bellows to it. Presently fresh streamers shot out of the darkness out-side the inner halo, followed by other bright shafts of light in a still wider circle, and meanwhile the dark space in the middle was clearly visible; at other times it was completely covered with masses of light. Then it appeared as if the storm abated, and the whole turned pale, and glowed with a faint whitish hue for a little while, only to shoot wildly up once more and to begin the same dance over again. Then the entire mass of light around the corona began to rock to and fro in large waves over the zenith and the dark central point, whereupon the gale seemed to increase and whirl the streamers into an inextricable tangle, till they merged into a luminous vapor that enveloped the corona and drowned it in a deluge of light, so that neither it nor the streamers, nor the dark centre could be seen--nothing, in fact, but a chaos of shining mist.""

OUR EXPLANATION

Now it is obvious that the real explanation of this phenomenon is to be found in those words which Nansen uses without seeing their real bearing on the problem: ""it appeared as if the storm abated"" and ""the gale seemed to increase"". As a matter of fact the light from the central sun was being reflected from the higher reaches of the earth's atmosphere and the reflection was interfered with by a violent storm in the interior of the earth. Clouds were rapidly being formed and being dissipated in that part of the interior near the polar, opening. Thus the rays of the central sun were one moment permitted to pass without obstruction; then the opening would be clouded up, at first perhaps by one dense cloud giving the central dark spot in the reflection of which Nansen speaks; then there would be a general filming over of the aperture and the result would be a diffused reflection.

Not only is it true that no other explanation fits the facts of the rapid changes without apparent cause, but Nansen himself acknowledges that he was quite ignorant of the cause of the phenomenon. He says:

""O thou mysterious radiance! What art thou and whence comest thou? Yet why ask? . . . . . What would it profit if we could say that it is an electric discharge or currents of electricity through the upper regions of the air, and were able to describe in minutest detail how it all came to be?""

NOT CAUSED BY ELECTRICITY

The reader will notice that Nansen does not commit himself to the popular view that the aurora is caused by electricity. In that he shows his wisdom, for we shall now deduce evidence to show that electricity has nothing whatever to do with the aurora.

If, as some people think, the earth's magnetism or electricity at the polar regions or around the earth's magnetic poles were the cause of the aurora, there would be a constant relation between its displays and the different instruments which have been constructed to tell the presence of magnetism and electricity--the compass would be affected and the electrometer would be affected. And there would certainly not be the irregularity about these displays that Nansen describes above. So now let us take the testimony of other observers. Payer who entered the Arctic circle on the ""Tegetthoff"" during the years 1872-1874, has a whole chapter devoted to the aurora. He says that it is very difficult to characterise the forms of this phenomenon, not only because they are manifold but because they are constantly changing. Sometimes there are brilliant bands and patches of light upon the sky, sometimes there are appearances like ""glowing balls of light"". He further says:

CLOUDS IN THE INTERIOR

""The movement of the waves of light gave the impression that they were the sports of winds, and their sudden and rapid rise resembled the uprisings of whirling vapors, such as the geysers might send forth In many cases the aurora much resembled a flash of summer lightning conceived as permanent"".

Now that description precisely fits in with what we have described as the reflection of the light of the central sun, that light being by turns cut off in one part and then another, here and there a gleam breaking through, as the atmosphere of the interior changed. That the appearance was ""the sport of winds,"" as Payer says, is literally true, only the winds were those shifting the clouds in the atmosphere on the inner side of the polar orifice. And it may be noted that a magnetic display could not be the sport of winds, for wind does not effect the ether in which medium along magnetic lines of force and electrical light from discharges work. If the aurora were caused by electrical lines of force discharging themselves in light, it would not be so capricious as described above. It would be a more or less steady appearance.

WHAT PAYER HAS TO SAY OF THE AURORA

Payer goes on to say that often after a brilliant aurora there would be bad weather which certainly sounds as if the storm clouds from which it was reflected from the inner sun were breaking, or perhaps a storm starting in the interior was coming over the lip and running its course in the Arctic circle. He adds that none of the theories current at the time explain the phenomenon. He thinks, however, that vapors rather than electricity may play a part in the phenomenon, especially on account of its ""indefinite form"" which, as we have pointed out above, is only explicable on our showing that the aurora is the reflection of the central sun and not due to any electrical discharge. A member of Payer's expedition, Lieutenant Weyprecht, describes one form of the aurora as an arch of light, looking as if ""it were the upper limit of a segment of a circle and it is often thrice the breath of a rainbow. Often as it rises other arches follow it, all rising toward the zenith."" Now we know that a rainbow is caused by the sun that lights the earth, and it is only natural that when the conditions are calm the reflection of the inner sun should also take this form--the circularity of the arch of the aurora simply being the reflection of the circular outline of that inner sun's diameter. Payer quotes Parry as saying that there was no magnetic disturbance when the aurora was seen. He, himself, is not able to make any connection between variations of the magnetic instruments and the presence of the aurora, although he tries hard to do so. As the final result of his observations he writes as follows:

""No pencil can draw it, no colors can paint it, and no words can describe it in all its magnificence. And here below stand we poor men and speak of knowledge and progress, and pride ourselves on the understanding with which we extort from Nature her mysteries. We stand and gaze on the mystery which Nature has written for us in flaming letters on the dark vault of night, and ultimately we can only wonder and confess that, in truth, we know nothing of it.""

Now some day that will appear very pessimistic, for we are making progress in knowledge, and about this very subject. After the enthusiastic description which Payer gives of the beauties of the aurora, might it not have occurred to him that magnetic or electrical discharges could not produce such grandeur because electrical flashes are only bright when the electricity is at a very high tension. But as soon as the tension of the electricity in the atmosphere becomes great enough we have a thunder storm, and we all know just how bright the lightning flash is. But how about these marvelous colors, this sea of flames of which Payer says ""is that sea red, white or green? Who can say?"" And Payer admits that it is even impossible to tell whether the ""rays shoot from above downward or from below upward."" Such colors could not possibly be produced by electricity; they are the colors of the interior sun partly split up like the rainbow by their breaking up as they pass from stratum to stratum of the atmosphere at length to be reflected back to us.

But we have denied that these displays have any effect on the magnetic needle or the electrometer. Let us verify that assertion by evidence more powerful than Payer's. Greely says in the book from which we have already quoted that ""it seems to be the experience here that the magnet is undisturbed during the prevalence of colorless auroras"" although he did observe in a few cases he reports that magnetic storms took place at about the same time as there were auroral displays. In these cases, however, it is certain that the conditions which produced the stormy and colored appearance of the aurora due to its refraction through damp air--also produced the magnetic storms, just as in our own latitudes an electrical storm is accompanied by a great deal of moisture in the air. While in ordinary weather, the atmosphere being uniform throughout, the auroral reflection is uncolored because it is not broken up into a spectrum and at the same time in such uniformly dry air there is nothing to cause a magnetic storm. But it by no means follows, from the fact that Greely saw these magnetic storms upon one or two occasions, that they always accompany colored auroras, for as a matter of fact they do not, as our further testimony shows.

But there is one important preliminary point. If the aurora is a reflection of the inner sun, it will only be on the rare occasions when the whole polar orifice is covered with cloud--and how rare such a condition would be, even in the damp atmosphere of the interior--that the aurora will be absent. The sun is always there, the orifice is always there, and the earth's atmosphere above the polar regions will always be dense enough to reflect some light, though not of course dense enough to reflect the wonderful lights that it sometimes does. So, if our theory be true, there ought always to be some auroral light at the pole. And we have the testimony of the celebrated French astronomer, Camille Flammarion, that this is so. In one place in his book, ""The Atmosphere"", he says: ""Nearly every night there is a more or less brilliant display of these auroral lights"". And later in the same book he says: ""This light of the earth, the emission of which toward the poles is almost continuous. . . . . .""

NOTHING TO DO WITH MAGNETISM

And now for the alleged disturbance of the magnet or other instruments. In Sargent and Cunning-ham's ""Wonders of the Arctic World,"" which is a carefully written account of the earlier expeditions, it is recorded that during the Second Land Expedition of Franklin, enough observations of the aurora were made with specially designed instruments and recorded to establish the fact that no disturbances of the magnetic needle accompanied the displays. (Page 164.)

We may corroborate this testimony by referring to ""Wonders of the Polar World"", by Herman Dieck, M. A., another work in which the main results of polar exploration are summarized. Mr. Dieck quotes a description of an aurora seen by Greely's men, in which the arch form which we have already described was very prominent, and also the prismatic colors showing that the aurora was colored through the breaking up of sunlight, just as in the case of the rainbow. And he adds that there was no noise--this is important, as electrical discharges are always accompanied by a crackling noise--and there was no disturbance of the compass. Later, Lieutenant Greely set up an electrometer, an instrument which records the presence of very small amounts of electricity, but ""to his astonishment"" there was not a trace of electrical disturbance. Greely also noticed that there were no crackling sounds in connection with the display.

BRUCE ON THE AURORA

It is often the case that once the real explanation of anything is found out, we get corroborative evidence from the most unexpected sources, and the reader who turns to a very recent and most depend-able work in the Home University Library, that of William S. Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, called ""Polar Exploration"", will find just such testimony. Professor Bruce says that the phenomenon occurs in other planets than our own and that it has been notably observed in Venus--which of course would be the case as the reader will remember that Venus occasionally shows us her central sun, and so we would naturally expect also to see its reflection in Venus' atmosphere. Professor Bruce also tells us that the early Norwegians held that the aurora was due to ""fires which surround the sea to the north"". Now that is very interesting because it suggests that perhaps these people had had in some way communication with the interior of the earth, and they might easily have thought that the central sun was some sort of fire. In fact some of them thought that the aurora was simply ""a reflection of the sun when it is below the horizon"" and that suggests that they had actually got far enough north to see the interior sun for a short time, perhaps, and that they afterwards saw its reflection in the sky in the form of an aurora, and remembering that they had just left the sun behind, they guessed that the two had this connection.

On the other hand, Professor Bruce quotes the observations of a British Antarctic Expedition to the effect that:

https://i.imgur.com/rrkrDD0.png

""The observations of atmospheric electricity taken during the displays reveal no special effect due to the aurora.""

There are some other considerations which show that the aurora is really due to the interior sun. Dr. Kane, in his account of his explorations, tells us that the aurora is brightest when it is white. That shows that when the reflection of the sun is so clear that the total white light is reflected, we get a much brighter effect than when the light is cut up into prismatic colors. In the latter case the atmosphere is damp and dense--that being the cause of the rainbow effect-- and through such an atmosphere one cannot see so much. Hence the display is not so bright as it is when the atmosphere is clear and the light not broken up.

THE NEARER THE POLE, THE BETTER THE DISPLAY

Again, if the aurora is the reflection of the central sun, we should expect to see it fully only near the polar orifice, and see only faint glimpses of its outer edges as we went further south. And that is precisely what is the actual fact of the matter. Says Dr. Nicholas Senn in his book ""In the Heart of the Arctics"":

""The aurora, which only occasionally is seen in our latitudes, is but the shadow of what is to be seen in the polar regions.""

And in ""Earth, Sea, and Sky,"" by H. D. Northrop, we read:

""As we retire from the pole, the phenomenon becomes a rare occurrence, and is less perfectly and distinctly developed.""

Regarding the two quotations just made a word of explanation is necessary. When Dr. Senn speaks of the aurora being only a ""shadow"" when it is seen some distance south he does not mean that it is a shade. He simply means that it is much fainter than when it is seen in the north. Now what is the reason of this? It is well known that certain laws of refraction of light cause a very bright rainbow to cast another rainbow, similar to itself at a distance from itself in the sky. Sometimes when the rainbow is very bright there is enough light being refracted so that two reflections are formed, and then the first reflection is paler than the original rainbow and the second reflection is still paler. Similarly, the auroral light is refracted in part so that a faint image of it or ""shadow"" is seen rather far to the south, sometimes as far south as the latitude of Illinois. But it is well known that no aurora or reflection of an aurora is ever seen at the equator, and as the aurora which is seen some distance from the north is only a shadow or reflection of the real aurora it is only occasionally, when the atmosphere happens to be right for it, that we see this phenomenon.

THE DISPLAY IS CONTINUOUS

H. D. Northrop further notes that the light of the aurora is continuous during the Arctic night, and he says that the arch which we have already mentioned as being such a prominent feature of the aurora is only ""part of a ring of light which is elevated considerably above the surface of our globe, and whose center is situated in the vicinity of the pole.""

And that is precisely what we should expect when we remember that it is the reflection of the rays coming through the polar orifice which causes the phenomenon. Northrop points out that a person looking at this ring from a point very far north would imagine that the aurora was to the south of him simply because the ring was so far spread out overhead.

This point is corroborated by the author of ""The Arctic World"" who says the same thing about the aurora. Meanwhile we find that William Denovan in his scientific reference work, ""The Phenomena of Nature"", makes the statement that:

""In temperate regions the aurora does not present such grand forms as in the extreme north.""

JUST LIKE THE SUN'S CORONA

The same author also makes another interesting point that supports our contention. It is that the corona or crown of light surrounding the sun is very like the light that the aurora gives us, and Nansen, in the second volume of his ""Farthest North,"" speaks of an aurora in which there was a reflection that looked very like a corona. But, the reader may say, that is only a chance resemblance. It might be thought so, but exact observation confirms the idea that the light is the same in both cases. Taylor Reed, writing in Popular Astronomy for 1895, describes the spectroscopic observation of the sun's corona and compares the result with the examination of the earth's aurora. He says:

""Both have their beautiful streams. Each has a characteristic form in the neighborhood of the pole of its sphere. Apply the spectroscope to each and the analogy is continued. Each gives in the spectrum an unidentified bright line, with fainter companions. Each shows a faint continuous spectrum.

We cannot imagine what further proof than the above anybody could need. If the two sorts of light give precisely the same spectroscopic appearances they must come from precisely similar sources. That is to say, if the corona is light caused by a sun, the aurora must also be light caused by a sun. And that is what we claim.

OBSERVATIONS BY EARLIER SCIENTISTS

Let us, before concluding, however, give one or two more citations to show that the evidence already adduced is not only to be had in isolated instances but is agreed with by all observers at all times. In the first place, verification of the fact that Greely obtained no results when he set up his electrometer during a display of the aurora when he was on his northern expedition, will be found in the interview which he gave the Associated Press and which was published all over the country and 'is to be found in the Scientific American Supplement for September 6, 1884. Again, Nordenskiold gave a correspondent of the New York Herald an account of his explorations in the Arctic in the course of which he made this very important announcement:

""Whenever the sky was clear, and there was no sun or moon, he saw constant in the northeast horizon, and almost always in the same exact spot, a faintly luminous arc so motionless as to be susceptible of accurate measurement. This phenomenon, Nordenskiold concludes, comes from an actual aureole, or ring of light, surrounding the northern portion of the globe.""

It is notable that Nordenskiold also says that there were no very brilliant displays that year. Evidently the weather was calm, there were no storms to make rapidly changing reflections, and as the air in the interior was probably laden with moisture the display was not brilliant. But the fact it was circular and steady shows that it was a reflection of a body that was also circular and steady, and reflected through a circular opening, and that body was no less than the interior sun.

It is interesting to note that the idea that the aurora is a reflection of sunlight is not confined to those old Norwegians we have spoken of. In an article translated from ""La Lumiere Electrique"" by the Scientific American Supplement for February 17, 1883, we are told that Descartes, Ellis, Frobisher, Franklin, Raspail and Wolfert, all thought that the aurora was from sunlight. They were near the truth, but they did not know what sun it really was that caused the light. In this same article we are told that the aurora is only seen at the pole and that any celestial light seen in the skies at lower latitudes--- such as the zodiacal light is not due to the aurora at all. In Nature, the volume of 1878, will be found an account of the eclipse of the sun as observed by the astronomer royal of Great Britain wherein it is stated that Professor Bass observed steadily for the whole period one part of the sun's corona, and he found that it pulsated in just the same manner as the aurora does.

THE AURORA AND THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CONTRASTED

And in conclusion we may repeat the observation of Payer, quoted also by W. J. Gordon in his book ""Round About the North Pole"", that it is impossible to discover whether the rays of the aurora shoot upward or downward. If those rays were electrical discharges they would all be going in the same direction, like the lines of force from a magnet. But the very fact that these rays are confused and seem to go now one way and now another, shows that they are light reflections which cross one another and appear and disappear as the reflecting surface--the upper layers of the atmosphere--varies. Thus we have one more item of the cumulative proof that the aurora is not a magnetic or electrical disturbance but simply a dazzling reflection from the rays of the central sun. And our next task is to see if there are not evidences of life in the land that is warmed by that sun. For if it warms continents and waters in the interior of the earth, if, as we have seen, birds have their feeding and breeding grounds there, if an occasional log or seed or pollen like dust is seen in the Arctic that come from some such unknown place as we have described, it ought to be possible to obtain enough evidence of such life as would prove up to the hilt the contention of this book.",conspiracy,Zodiac

Is it standard for most of the civilization to be unaware? If so, why? If not, why have the elite stopped the flow information? What changed? 

----

BACKGROUND:

Many ancient sites and cathedrals hold within their geographic location, physical dimension and construction, a reference or relationship to mathematical universal constants and cycles of our galaxy, planet and solar system. Most notably, the Precession (approx. 26,000 years) and a Zodiac (approx. 1/12 of a Precession). 

The most understood link of these times seems to correlate with the change of climate and the impact of human civilizations across the globe; similar to descriptions of cataclysms and disasters found in myths, stories, and many religions. 

Regardless of what the time keeping matched with, these sites were developed in different eras and peoples, yet they all count the same thing in a similar manner. The civilizations are separated by time and cultures but the knowledge still remained. This knowledge was either rediscovered every time (unlikely) or being passed down. I believe the latter is more likely because the methodology (geographic significance and Giza profile) to achieve the same time keeping remained constant despite contemporary differences and technological capabilities. From this point, you can infer there was some greater practice to carry on this knowledge for whatever reason.

Now here's where it connects back to conspiracy theory. Whatever the event(s) may have been, the successors/survivors must have at least included the people with such knowledge. It is often theorized the modern day elite are more aware than what has been discovered. If this is the case, it would follow the elite are part of the the lineage (not necessarily in the ancestral sense) of these timekeeping bearers. 

Question: Why is such knowledge kept hidden? Is it standard for most of the civilization to be unaware? If so, why? If not, why have the elite stopped the flow information? What changed?

(This is not my writing, just something I discovered. Simon Cassidy in 1996 discovered this strange possibility)

{Subject: Implementing a correct 33-year calendar reform
Date: Wednesday, 09 Oct 1996 (finalized)
From: Simon Cassidy <simoncas@pacbell.net>
To: East Carolina University Calendar Discussion List
I will take up from where I left off, (answering Rick McCarty's query about how I think a 33-year calendar could work), by repeating the relevant significant paragraph at the end of my ""Thirty-three year calendars"" message:

>Let me be clear that I am not proposing that such a scheme (of moving the
>leap-day around the year by stepping it through some eight stations in the
>calendar scheme) is an appropriate scheme for reforming our current
>calendar (though neo-pagans may get very enthusiastic about the idea) nor
>should you suppose that this was the secret scheme, and perfect rival to
>the Gregorian calendar reform, which I have discovered was contemplated, and
>suppressed, in both Vatican and English circles ca. 1600 A.D..

That scheme (the only one that I feel is appropriate for our time), which has appeal for christians and non-christians alike, since it embodies many different traditions of human knowledge into a perfect christian solar (and solunar) penitential reform, is simplicity itself, and has been in effect since March 1st. 1980 on a probationary trial period of 36 years!

All we HAVE to do (before the trial period granted to us ends, on February 28th. 2016) is to decide, whether we wish to continue having leap years in A.D. years with numbers divisible by 4, except century years not divisible by 400 (the simplest expression of Pope Gregory's rule); or whether instead TO CONTINUE WITH A CYCLIC REPETITION OF THE EIGHT NOMINAL LEAP-YEARS IN THE 33-YEAR TRADITIONAL LIFE OF JESUS!

The above statement, in terms of the life of Jesus is an elegant and totally sufficient and determinative definition of the proposed new way to insert leap years, but is not prescriptive in a simple numerical fashion like the Gregorian rule (which requires no math. beyond the 4-times-table up to 100).

Fortunately, this years-of-Jesus rule (henceforth referred to as the ""Anni- Domini"" rule) is exactly equivalent to a mathematical statement which requires no more arithmetic than the 4-times-table up to 32 (and the simple shopper and shopkeeper's, price-totalling and change-making skill, needed for a couple of double-digit additions or subtractions).

In mathematical language we can say ""February will have 29 days whenever the A.D. year-number, reduced modulo 33, is non-zero and divisible by 4.""

But, in its simplest layman's formulation, here, finally, is the Anni-Domini Leap-Year Decision Procedure, which will (initially) triple the current accuracy with which the calendar follows the Vernal Equinox.**

Start with the Anno Domini year-number to be tested.

Get a new year-number by adding the number of centuries in it to the remaining number of years (beyond whole centuries). E.G. for 2012 A.D. add 20 to 12 to get 32 A.D.

If possible repeat the first step until it can no longer reduce the year. E.G. for 1996 A.D. add 19 to 96 to get 115 A.D. then repeat and add 1 to 15 to get 16 A.D.

If the result is greater than 33 A.D. then subtract 33 or 66 to finish. E.G. for 2016 A.D. add 20 to 16 to get 36 A.D. then subtract 33 from 36 to get 3 A.D.

We now have a year-number guaranteed to be between 1 and 33 A.D. inclusive. If it is 4,8,12,16,20,24,28 or 32 A.D. then the tested year is a leap-year.

So, 2012 reduces to 32 and thus is a leap-year, and 1996 reduces to 115, then to 16 and thus is a leap-year, but 2016 reduces to 36, then to 3, so is not leap in the Anni-Domini system.

One or two, double-digit additions, or, one addition and one subtraction, will suffice for all year-numbers until 3498 A.D. Then, two additions and one subtraction, or three additions, may be necessary (but three additions and one subtraction will not be necessary until 340,099 A.D.).

Note that this, current, millennial transition period, in which both the Gregorian and Anni-Domini leap-years are the same (from 1981-2015) is like the similar period around 1600 (1585-1619). This explains how John Dee's friends in parliament (Raleigh's group), were able to submit, in his absence, a concrete proposal for his calendar reform in 1585 and yet not reveal its leap-year rule. They did not have to specify any new leap-year rule until 1620! They just had to specify the number of days to apply as the special julian-discontinuity-correction.

Dee's treatise written in 1582, specified an eleven-day correction. But it is followed by a note allowing a ten day correction for the year 1583. This is usually interpreted as Dee capitulating to the Gregorian correction so that e.g. commerce with France would not be affected by differing calendars. But actually, in the Anni-Domini calendar, 1583 should be a leap year not 1584. Thus a ten-day correction in 1583 combined with NO LEAP DAY in 1584 adds up to an 11 day correction for the years 1585-1619. Similarly an eleven day correction if applied in 1582 (when Dee apparently wrote the main body of his treatise) would be synchronous with the Gregorian calendar (with its ten day correction in 1582) only for the period March 1583 to February 28th. 1584. The Anni-Domini cycle required a February 29th. 1583, which would pull Dee's correction back to a temporary synchrony with the Gregorian calendar, just until February 28th. 1584, when, as already stated, the Gregorian calendar's leap day would pull it back, to being one day behind the Anni-Domini calendar, again.

This is just to forewarn you that other historians will insist that there is proof, in Dee's own handwriting, that he proposed that England follow the Pope's calendar reform (an otherwise most unlikely assertion, given what I have already narrated to you, about the attitude of his circle to the Catholic League, Pope Gregory himself, and the jesuits). The secrecy around the whole project has confused all historians to date. And note that when I talk about February 1583 or February 1584 I am using the modern convention which begins the year with January; NOT the convention used by many Englishmen of the time which started the year in March. The confusion over which convention Dee used has not helped clarify matters either!

The secrecy was required by Dee's anti-Spanish colleagues (who needed time to first break King Phillip's monopoly on the calendrical longitude) and this kept postponing official implementation. Dee left for Germany, in September of 1583, to confer with William ""the wise"" and feel out the alchemical Emperor Rudolph. Dee was irenic at heart and probably hoped to be able to persuade the Holy Roman Emperor and thus all his Catholic subjects, to desert the corrupt Papal calendar for the perfect Nicene version which he had entrusted to Raleigh's ""Atlantical"" venture and parliament.

In light of the apparently implausible nature of my ""conspiracy theory"", it is instructive to examine the wonderful double meaning in a little piece of verse (perhaps inspired by Dee's spritely adviser Uriel) which appears to be, as intended for insertion, in that particular reform proposal of Dee's, which planned for a 1583 10-day correction by Queen Elizabeth (I will attempt authentication to confirm Dee's authorship.)


             ELIZABETH our Empress bright,
             Who in the yere of eighty three,
             Thus made the truth to come to light,
             And civile yere with heaven agree.

             But eighty foure, the Pattern is
             Of Christ's birth yere: and so for ay
             Eche Bissext shall fall little mys,
             To shew the sun of Christ birth day.

             Three hundred years, shall not remove
             The sun, one day, from this new match:
             Nature, no more shall us reprove
             Her golden tyme, so yll to watch.

The second of these three consecutive verses from the piece is usually, as here by Poole, interpreted to simply repeat the statement, in the body of the treatise, that the birth year of Jesus is commonly held to be a leap-year (""Bissext"") and that 1584 will be like it in this respect and the Sun will be in the same point of the zodiac (on Christmas day or New Years) for Jesus' anniversary.

However, from the point of view of the Anni-Domini calendar rule, a whole other meaning springs to light. The 33-year ""Pattern"" of the rule makes the year 1584 (0 modulo 33) equivalent to 1 B.C. (traditionally Christs birth year) AND 33 A.D. (traditionally the year of the Passion), thus marking the beginning and end of a cyclic repetition of the life of Jesus. ""And so for ay"", thus, using this ""Pattern"", we can from now on, place each leap year (""Eche bissext"") with almost no error (""shall fall little mys""), repeating the solar behaviour over and over, in a cycle begun at the birth of Christ.

Note also that, as Dee was certainly aware, it was not at all clear that the year now known as 1 B.C. really was a leap-year; that is, officially, and as actually observed, in the then Roman, Civil Calendar (when of course it was not known as the year 1 B.C. but as some year of Augustus or his consuls). Dee's young friend, Thomas Harriot, who went to Roanoke and did the survey, with John White in 1585-6, of the area necessary to stake England's claim to the Calendrical meridian (its there on their map!), apparently collected the various theories, about this ambiguity in the way leap years were assigned from 45 B.C. (1 Julius Caesar) to 8 A.D. (53 Julius Caesar). These theories can be found set out in columns, in BM MS ADD. 6788 (Thomas Harriot Mathematical Papers) at folio 499 (Recto), written after Dee and Clavius were both dead. Harriot was apparently concerned abut Christoph. Clavius' and Joseph Justus Scaliger's claim that neither 1 B.C. nor 4 A.D. were ""actually"" leap years (this theory is labelled as theirs in his column 7). Such claims would tend to undercut the elegance of the ""years-of-Jesus"" appeal of the Anni-Domini 33-year leap-day cycle. At columns 2 and 3 of his table, Harriot posits unnamed theories which probably represent the two alternatives that our spritely verse holds out.

The first alternative (Harriot's column 2; column 1 being the years numbered from the calendars inauguration, by Julius Caesar in 45 B.C.) is the banal unthinking assumption that the Romans had a leap year every four years from Julius Caesar on. This meaning would hold if Dee's calendar reform were not carried out properly after he left for Germany, and 1584 were deemed a leap year in contradiction to the Anni-Domini prescription. The second alternative (Harriot's column 3) however, has 1 B.C. a common year and has the four-year leap-days starting with 4 A.D., precisely in accord with the Anni-Domini rule, and with the hidden meaning of the verse. This second hidden meaning would only become apparent if parliament deemed 1584 a common non-leap year while Dee was to be away in Germany, or if posterity were to see Dee's ""plat for the means"".

The third verse is usually held to predict that the accuracy of the new calendar will match the sun's behaviour (every Christmas day?) to an accuracy of one day in three hundred years. This is not much of a claim to accuracy since it implies a possible error of up to 0.0033 days between the real solar year (based on Christmas or New Year?) and the proposed Elizabethan reform's average year (despite the fact that this putative average calendar-year or the procedure for maintaining an average year different from the julian one, is never actually stated anywhere in the extant works credited to Dee!!). If Dee really meant to follow the Gregorian year-length and leap-year rule, then he would have known that the accuracy (for any point in the tropical zodiac) was much better than this apparent 0.0033 days/year claim.

On the other hand, in terms of the accuracy of the Anni-Domini leap-year rule, this verse can be claiming that the Vernal Equinox will always occur on the same calendar day for at least three hundred years (at some calendrical prime meridian). This claim is much more in line with what we know of the accuracy of astronomy in Dee's time (both claimed and in retrospect). It is claiming an inaccuracy of no more than one ten thousandth of a day between the (unmentioned) average year of the proposed Elizabethan calendar and the true tropical year (true ""Vernal Equinox"" flavour, not the modern tropical Newcomb-style year, wrongly characterized as the mean year between V.E.s).

In retrospect this claim is uncannily accurate, in that, from 1580 until 1880, for calendar days beginning and ending at midnight local apparent time (the most unambiguous rule available in Dee's time), the Vernal equinox would indeed have occured always on March 21st. at the longitude that Sir Walter tried to plant his city of Raleigh in ""Old Virginia"" (i.e. White's ""50 miles into the main"" from Roanoke Island, under the one meridian drawn, on his and Harriot's, map of the area, which also shows its relation to the Bahamas). That is, of course, if the full calendar reform with the ten-day correction in 1583 and NO LEAP DAY in 1584 using the Anni-Domini leap-year rule had been properly implemented!

I invite those of you mathematically competent, to do the detailed calculations and also check the history of time-conventions in effect at the dates involved. I personally am left amazed at the prophetic quality of this verse. If the calendrical meridian is calculated based on local mean time rather than apparent time (versions of mean time were in use by some astronomers in Dee's era) then ""White's Raleigh longitude"" seems good to this day, but if apparent local time is adhered to then ""White's lost city of Raleigh"" was saved from experiencing March 20th. Vernal Equinoxes (under the 11-day julian-corrected Anni-Domini calendar) in the nick of time by Railway Time-zone time of the 1880s becoming standardized to the mean-time under the meridian which lies exactly 5 hours behind Greenwich (75 degrees of longitude West of Greenwich meridian).

""At noon or before on Sunday 18 November 1883 public clocks all over North America were altered to the 'new standard of time agreed upon, first by the railroads, for the sake of the uniformity of their schedules, but since generally adopted by the community through the action of various officials and corporate bodies as an obvious convenience in all social and business matters'"" (Derek Howse in ""Greenwich Time"" 1980, quoting the New York Herald newspaper of that date?). November 1883 is 300 years to the month, from Dee's mysterious ""secrett"" deadline for implementation of his Calendar Reform.

As we all probably know, Ralegh's American colonisation attempts failed, the last being John White's ""Lost Colony"" in 1587. Most everything but the Spanish Armada was forgotten about, in the following year of 1588. Dee's calendar has languished in secret ghostly committee ever since! Although some thought the ghost of Dee exorcised, when the British parliament implemented an eleven-day correction in 1752, we should note, that Queen Elizabeth herself, at the prompting of her new favorite Walter Raleigh, had reassured Dee, in April of 1583, that ""Quod defertur non aufertur"" (What is deferred, SHALL NOT BE ABORTED!).

And mow we can see why Dee insisted, on an eleven day correction in contrast to the Gregorian ten day correction (though his extant treatise disguises the reasons), before leaving, in 1583, to attempt to convert the Holy Roman Emperor to his calendar. With a ten-day correction, his Anni-Domini leap-year cycle would have kept the Vernal Equinox always on the 20th. of March (at longitudes through Raleigh Virginia), but, with an eleven day correction, the Vernal equinox would have always fallen on 21st. March, the stated Nicene goal of the Gregorian reform! He certainly had a wonderfully seductive proposal for a Holy Roman Emperor who might feel miffed at the Pope, for not allowing the calendar reform pronouncement to emanate from the proper Imperial quarters. Dee could hand the Emperor a proposal even more Catholic and Orthodox than the Pope's! As it turned out, Dee fell foul of Vatican agents in Prague, and may never have felt secure enough to confide in any of Rudolph's experts.

Though I doubt that there will be any calendar reform before the turn of the century, I propose that, if and when it is decided, to adopt the Anni- -Domini leap-year rule, then we ought to ritually expunge Pope Gregory XIII from our calendar, by finally applying Dee's extra day of correction.

In this way, the Nicene tradition will finally be fulfilled and the Equinox will occur on March 21st. For as long as Gaia (Earth's rotation) allows. This symbolic changing of the guard could conveniently, and with all solemnity, be achieved with no requirement for any special activity on the actual date affected by the proclamation. The ritual would consist of an act of government(s) naming February 29th 2000AD ""Pope Gregory XIII Day"" and then immediately thereupon, consigning his name and calendar to perdition by passing the act of discontinuity, which will leap one day ahead of the Gregorian calendar by declaring the year 2000 A.D. to be (or have been) a regular non-leap year! (as were 1800 and 1900 A.D.).

In this fashion no planet need be offended ever again by having its day of the week associated with Pope Gregory XIII's leap-days (pardon my levity).

After the Vatican recovers from high dudgeon, it will find that its Easter and metonic solunar tables will work readily and more accurately in the new Anni-Domini leap-year system, by the simple expedient of applying their lunar correction every 231 years (e.g. whenever Monday the 29th. February is followed, five years later, by Sunday 29th. February) instead of the current application of lunar corrections at some of the century years.

The increasing solar accuracy will actually keep the Vernal Equinox within the same twenty-four calendar-hour period, every year for many centuries (probably for millenia) to come. This 24-hour period will be always on the same calendar date (for local, apparent or mean time) at longitudes such as Bermuda (Where Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" envisages Dee with his spiritual adviser Uriel, as Prosper and the spirit Ariel, surrendering his magic staff into the earth and his book into the water). If, however, we consider calendar dates to be CIVILLY separated, by the stroke of midnight ZONE-TIME, then the Eastern Standard Time-zone (5 hours behind Greenwich) is still currently the place where the Vernal Equinox can stay on the same date, but a new time-zone (4 and 1/2 hours behind Greenwich) may succeed it, in some future century. (Math. based on Meeus '83 & '91).}

143,summary of the last 90 years of the secret history of the world,4.0,wzuy5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/wzuy5p/summary_of_the_last_90_years_of_the_secret/,9.0,1661691625.0,"The below is a summary of the last 90 years of the secret history of the world that I've been able to piece together over 12 years of research. 

In the 1930s a space craft was recovered and some dead alien bodies were found which were taken to be examined in a bunker beneath the white house. This was kept a secret by the government who were coincidentally also elitists in some secret societies at the time so all high ranking secret society members knew of the aliens.

When the Roswell incident happened in 1947, 5 alien bodies were recovered along with a live alien nicknamed Ebe (extra terrestrial biological entity) in Corona New Mexico. Another craft was found 2 years later in Magdelena New Mexico with 5 dead occupants severely decomposed from the same race.

From the two craft recoveries, it was clear that a head on collission occurred but unknown why the accident happened in the first place. 

President Truman enacted four pieces of legislation after the Roswell crash: 1) split the us military into Marine, Airforce, Army and Navy to better compartmentalise information; 2) create the NSA; 3) formalise the CIA with a constitution; and 4) create a secret agency called Majority Agency for Joint Intelligence (MAJI) which is overseen by twelve people called the Majestic Twelve (now called the Zodiac Group).

All ufo related data is scrubbed from the NSA, CIA and FBI and consolidated up at the MAJI level. 

Through Ebe's help we contacted his home world to organise an exchange program. Ebe though only lived until 1952 (cause of death not known by me).
12 humans were selected (all men, two women were preselected but cut from the final team) who went to one of the planets in Zeta Reticuli system.

There were four habited planets around that binary star system, Ebe's race of aliens lived on two, the greys lived on another who were android beings created by Ebe's race and also an insect like alien lived on another planet who were also genetically engineered aliens by Ebe's race.

Ebes came here in 1953 and met with Dwight Eisenhower at Holloman Air Force base when the exchange program was to start but they changed the plan and only took their dead comrades home and delayed the exchange program by 10 years.

When President JFK came into office in 1961, he knew about the aliens (he signed off on the citizen exchange program) and the secret societies and wanted to tell the world about it. He sought to defund the secret societies by getting rid of the Federal Reserve and by getting the US Treasury to take over the role. He created the DIA to increase accountability for all US spy agencies and he tried to get rid of the CIA as well. He also sealed Marilyn Monroe fate by telling her about the aliens apparently whilst he was having an affair with her. 

In 1963, the Ebes contacted us and confirmed another delay of an additional year but as our exchange citizens were ready to go, we incarcerated the exchange personnel in isolation in a max security jail for a year so that they had no outside contact until 3 weeks after JFK died when President LBJ had to give approval for the mission to proceed.

Note that this was a MAJI Controlled (ie MAJIC) project but the actual project management was handed over to the Airforce.

The mission was to last 10 years but due to some miscalculations the humans came back in 1978 (14 years later).
Two died enroute (one there and one back), one died on the alien planet, two remained on the aliens World and 7 returned. The last one died in 2002.
The alien who came here through the exchange called himself Korona and we nick named him J-Rod. Unknown what happened to J-Rod.

The last official meeting with Ebes was in 2012 when they made an official visit. Many human delegates were gathered: 3 delegates from Obama administration; 1 delegate from Russia:  1 delegate from China; 1 delegate from the Vatican; 15 delegates and guests from the US military were assembled.

This story was leaked to Steven Spielberg (maybe for an acclimitisation program) who made two movies out of it: ET; and Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind. To this day Spielberg will not disclose how he came up with the ideas for his two alien movies.",conspiracy,Zodiac

Almost everyday. 

Not literal monkeys and tigers, but things around my college campus. Such as an event I was required to go to where the title of the mans speech was “Tigers hiding in life” and the casual audition for the schools plays where I only got called back for the show “Tigers Be Still”. 

Besides those facts it’s a regular Daily occurrence of people talking about tigers.

Then yesterday happened where my Roomate said he was going to get a pet monkey. I thought it was a fun idea, but living with a monkey would be like living with a three year old. That same day another one of my friends called me out of the blue and he talked about a class he was talking on primate biology.

But then everything got much weirder when another of my friends asked me for my date of birth. They then sent me my primal zodiac sign which is a Chimpanzee....a monkey. Not only that but the year I was born in was the year of the Tiger. 

I would say I’m a pretty observant person and am always curious. I don’t know if this constitutes as a conspiracy, but it sure as hell hasn’t been helping with my crippling anxiety and daily occurrence of Deja Vu.

Am I just going crazy or is there some kind of reasoning behind this? Is it just a coincidence that all of this is happening? Is something going  to happen come the next year of the Tiger (2022).

I’m curious if I can get a conversation going on this, because it doesn’t real.

Edit: I also realized this from a year ago, I would constantly have a dream about a monkey(which I ended up calling dream monkey) I even drew a picture of him pretty wild.",conspiracy,Zodiac

The Aquarian energy is known as the rebel of the zodiac and is the most rare sign people are born under which often results in them being outcasted but they have become more accepted in the last 5 decades or so bc we have been in the age of Aquarius for some time now. 

They're known for appearing very liberal, ""non judgemental"" and on the more weird side so they can be known for their quirks. They aren't typically interested in traditional values and actually tend to live a very taboo life. These are people who can be found in cults or leading them (Ex: Charles Manson Aquarius moon) They find it difficult to relate to most people. What we are seeing today is the rise of a cult in the disguise of light and love. 

That's not to say that everything they advocate for is wrong but the founders of this movement have ulterior motives for these seemingly loving acts of love. 

It's influence is responsible for things such as the freedom of slaves (thanks to Lincoln who was an Aquarius),  legalization of interracial relationships, the lgbtq community, civil rights and liberation movements such as ""feminism"". 

Many of their beliefs are inconvenient and cause chaos. Their disorderly and reckless values have resulted in many unprepared and unwanted pregnancies which is why they are also responsible for the legalization of abortion and welfare for people who have made reckless decisions. They believe people should live as they please and if they mess up, we need to all come together, waste resources and ""help"" them (aka enable their bad habits). Apparently we need to all be on board in the name of freedom. 

These are just the more light things they have fought for but now they're slowly weining us into accepting that ""love"" comes in all forms, such as child and adult relationships which they have made more normal behind the scenes for years. Now we're just seeing the aftermath. People influenced by this is energy tend to have difficulties fitting in which explains their odd interests. They also tend to have an emotionally detached mother or parents which stunts their emotional development and ability to relate to healthy humans on an emotional level. Their detachment aids in their ability to be unaffected by things that hurt most people. 

They are aware that they aren't affected like most are which is why they have strived to create generations of emotionally detached people and have succeded to some extent. Unfortunately, that plan is sort of backfiring bc their values have caused many people mental/emotional damage. People are upset enough to call out their sick culture. Others assimilate out of fear of rejection or bc the programming has worked on them. 

They're responsible for the advancement of technology. They have used this as a weapon and are currently shadow banning opinions that do not fit their robotic utopia. If you are an Aquarius sun, moon, mercury, ascendant, Venus, mars, lilith or Aquarius in the 8th house, feel free to reevaluate yourself if necessary. You probably won't but that is just a fair warning.",conspiracy,Zodiac

Apocalypse of this millenia

The 4 horsemen

Pestilence- covid of 2020

Death- millions that has died of covid

War- there is another war that may happen whether it be World War 3 or a war Against our own government.

Famine- we’re overpopulated with over 7.753 billion people with food and water shortages worldwide

Super volcanoes 

Yellowstone being the largest of the 8(6 still dormant)  super volcanoes being over 26,00 years overdue,once it goes off it could trigger all the other super volcanoes of the world causing a massive worldwide extinction event. 

Age of Aquarius and planetary alignments 

Every 2,162 years we go through an astronomical cycle with the 12 known zodiacs that influence the rise and fall of our civilizations as we know it today and our cultural tendencies. Traditionally Aquarius has influenced electricity, computers, democracy, freedom, humanitarianism, idealism, rebellion. Not just that, we're going through multiple planetary retrogrades within our own solar system with  Mercury being the first representing passion and humanity with the air sign Libra. Neptune is  representing our  unconscious thoughts and processes, a time to return to the real world, maybe that's why we’re having so many Mandela effects as of recent, we all could remember 1 thing but another group could remember something completely different with our current world timeline making our true memories hazy to what others believe is true to them.

Mayan calendar

Remember how the Mayan Calendar stopped in the year 2012 depicting the end of civilizations? It never happened, we’ve been going by the Gregorian calendar since 1582 after being on the Julian calendar since 46 B.C. the Julian calendar had to be replaced  because it did not correctly reflect the actual time it takes for Earth to circle around the Sun known as the tropical year, when we had swapped over to the Gregorian in 1582 we have lost 8 years to translation , that being said the year for us now is 2013.that means 2020 was 2012 and the whole world went into a pandemic, Australian wildfires, Kobe Bryant dying in a helicopter crash, covid 19, new media blowing everything out of proportion, murder hornets, shootings going out of control. 

Today

The government is slowly taking away our constitutional rights. forcing people to give up their guns that we need for self defense. Forcing everyone to take a vaccine just so we could keep our jobs, not everyone could take it, we could be too young or allergic to it and it just kills us. Yeah it does some good but not everyone wants it and not everyone needs it. The US government is slowly becoming a dictatorship. Take down “offensive” statues that teach our history. Yeah like we’re not having a repeat of our history that my generation is experiencing. Limiting our right to freedom of speech, damn near taking away the right to freedom of religion (Muslim) just so we could be safe from the terrorists when they’re just practicing their beliefs  when the real terrorists are the 1s in our own backyards or within our own government. Today i had learned about 1 of the laws within our constitution, Article 10: to prevent government overreach, to protect the liberty of our people, and our next generations, that being said we can overthrow the government  to protect ourselves, what we saw happen earlier this year when trump was coming out of office was us fighting to keep our liberties safe. It was an attempt of a government takeover cause they knew what's about to come.

To this day, this medieval artifact could not be deciphered, being written in an absolutely unknown language. The scientists agreed on one thing: the textbook is not a fake because it is too elaborate and certainly expensive and difficult to make.

Named after a Polish-American antique dealer, Wilfrid M. Voynich, who purchased the manuscript in 1912, the book has nearly 240 coded pages, written in a language that could not be deciphered.

Its pages also contain colorful drawings depicting diagrams depicting strange events, plants that do not exist on Earth, which makes the manuscript even more difficult to understand.

The original author of the manuscript is not known, but carbon dating has revealed that the pages of the book were produced between 1404 and 1438.

There are a lot of theories about the origin of the manuscript. Some believe it was a medieval pharmacopoeia or from the beginnings of modern medicine. Many of the images with herbs and plants indicate that it could be an alchemist's manual. The fact that many of the diagrams appear to be of astrological origin, along with unidentifiable biological drawings, has led many to believe that the manuscript may be of extraterrestrial origin.

Depending on the subject of the drawings, the content of the manuscript can be divided into six sections:

1. botanical drawings of 113 unidentified plant species

2. astronomical and astrological drawings, including astral calendars, zodiac signs like Pisces, Taurus and Sagittarius, naked women coming out of pipes or cylinders

3. a section on biology with nudes of women, mostly with swollen abdomens, submerged in liquid and interacting with tubes and capsules

4. a succession of nine elaborate cosmological medallions, which probably represent geographical forms

5. pharmaceutical designs with over 100 species of medicinal plants and roots in glass containers

6. whole pages of text, probably recipes, with flowers drawn on the edge of the pages

But the real number is 223

Using the simple cipher A=1 B=2 C=3

THE SYNAGOGUE OF SATAN= 223

SKULL AND CROSSBONES= 223

Jesus supposedly used this phrase --the synagogue of satan--in the book of Revelation when he sent a message to the church in a place called Philadelphia

PHILADELPHIA= 223

which proves that the Book of Revelation is fakery

The Bible was written in Greek & Latin & they didnt use the modern number system

So the fact that-- The Synagogue of Satan & Philadelphia-- have the same numerology proves the Book of Revelations was written in the Middle Ages when the modern number system was adopted

By the way--if New York City was the capital of America--why was the Declaration of Independence signed in Philadelphia

THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER= 223

In 1873 Pope Pius referred to Freemasonry as the Synagogue of Satan

using the Jewish cipher-- MASONIC= 223

&#x200B;

Nor is it a coincidence that the Queen made her exit just in time for Charles to be crowned during The Synagogue of Satan Year 2023

2023= 223

When King Chales is crowned--- he will wear St Edwards gold crown which just happens to weigh **2.23** kg

the original crown was melted down & recreated after the Restoration in 1661 for Charles II---around the same time the metric system had been proposed

So the British have been using 223--since at least the 1660s

Using the prime number code where A=2 B= 3 C= 5

LUCIFER= 223

&#x200B;

So Globalists use the numbers 223/ 322 when signalling to their minions that events are staged--fakery--staged to instill fear & dependency on the Established System

These numbers are planted in alot of staged historical events--esp fake serial murderers

31 AUGUST 1888 5 WOMEN MURDERED BY JACK THE RIPPER= 223

NICHOLE BROWN SIMPSON MURDER= 322

8 AUGUST 1969 SHARON TATE MURDER= 322 (Manson Murders)

1976 SON OF SAM MURDERS= 223 (also known as..THE 44 CALIBRE MURDERS= 322)

# The Astrology hoax - not only for making naive waste their time

**Introduction**  
As some of the illusions used to control the minds of people turn to be less and less efficient (like [UFOS & Co.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/4zrqa7/the_ufo_coverup_not_only_for_making_naive_waste/)), the system uses always more and more astrology.  

**Astrology - a mind control weapon, used always more and more**  
To illustrate this, just answer this question: what do all the women's magazines, from the U.S. to Germany, from Norway to Italy, have in common, in their December 2000 edition cover ?  
The answer is: the horoscope for the next year.   
Astrology, even in its more simple form, as it is presented by these magazines (based on the date of birth alone) proves to be in fact one of the more efficient mind control weapons.  

Answering the questions ...:  
- how easy is it to expose the astrology hoax ?  
- if it is so easy to expose it,  why can the system continue to use astrology (more and more) ?  
- how is astrology used as mind control weapon ?  
... might be a big help to let you understand the answers to the fundamental questions of life.

**How easily can astrology be  debunked ?**  
All you have to do is to use the blind test technique.  
ask the astrology experts to give their horoscope for the twelve zodiac signs for the next period and to use a scale (say from 1 to 5) for each item (say health, love, money):  
- seal their predictions;  
- ask, after the end of the period, a statistically significant universe of people (say 100 persons for each sign, so a total of 1200 people) how do they value each item in the same scale.  

Now compare the results. You will see that:  
- each astrologist has valued each item differently, according to the sign (say - Love-4.5, for Taurus, Love-1.5 for Sagittarius);  
- the results of the average will be more or less the same for the people's answers (say - Love-3.7, for Taurus, Love-3.1 for Sagittarius). The people you will use in this experiment, the more the results will be similar (say - Love-3.3, for Taurus, Love-3.2 for Sagittarius).  

So this is an easy way to prove that astrology is an hoax.

**Why can the system continue to use astrology ?**  
The first reason is the simple fact that all the media is totally controlled. So even it is so easy to debunk astrology, the system will make sure this will not happen.  
To understand the second reason, consider this question, that was posed to a statistically significant number of people.  

In a certain town there are two maternities. In maternity A there are 50 births average each week. In maternity B there are 5 births average each week. The chances of a baby being a boy are exactly the same as of being a girl (fifty-fifty).  

Now consider the question: where are the chances higher, in a particular week to have 60% or more of the new born being boys ?  
What do you think is the right answer:  
- maternity A;   
- maternity B;  
- both the same.  
Before continuing to read, please think a bit about YOUR answer.  

Now let me tell you what the results were: one quarter of the people answered A, one quarter of the people answered B, and 50% of the people said both the same.  
The right answer is: maternity B. Just think about this: you can expect this to happen each two weeks in maternity B. In an average week, one out of two times there will be three boys and two girls born. And that means that the condition is true - more than 60% boys were born.  
The results shows one of the errors that many people make: they make their conclusions based on a small number of observations.  

But - and this is what statistics is all about - you need a relevant number of observations to get valid conclusions. This is why the test mentioned above, that could easily debunk astrology to the masses, will never be carried out by the system mass media.  

**How is astrology used as mind control weapon ?**  
Once you believe in astrology, you give up the capacity to think.

Music is occultism (music industry), I wouldn’t mind if someone had some resources to share on musicians ties to masonry, witchcraft, and other secret societies (not just Illuminati) and the prevelence and their intent in having this in their music. I know the major rock label of the 20th century was zodiac records and it’s ties to occultism, rock music is satanism (Led Zeppelin stairway to heaven reverse is satanic, Black Sabbath obvious satanic meaning and messages in songs, Ac/dc= antichrist devils children and has the devils lightning bolt between them, etc). Musics tie to witchcraft and satanism makes sense, because before he fell the devil was the minister of music so to speak in heaven, and was very gifted by God, but became prideful and wanted the worship the Creator who had given him everything received, and fell. It only makes sense the devil would be involved in music, and you can see that evidence everywhere, I guess what I’m asking is if someone can send resources to see why this music is so dangerous, if the devil is invested in it then it has to be. I have heard of frequency programming, the 144hz (I may have the number wrong), backmasked messages, subliminal, the music being hypnotic, and it’s psychological and other effects on people - but if anyone can explain to me or send me resources on how witchcraft (unnatural, spiritual and other manipulation of people is the definition I’ve come across, I’m sure there’s more to it) plays a major role in the music I’d appreciate it. I know people like Mozart, Beethoven (I believe) and many other classical and modern composers and the music industry as a whole even mainstream “christian” artists are masons or occultists. 


Really this occultism can be seen in Hollywood corporations governments media music and pretty much anything in this world system, the prevelance is astounding and it even codes future events like 9/11 and trumps presidency etc etc. in the new world order I am seeing trump may have a bigger role than I’d thought at first, he seems to be a major player/puppet in implementing the new world order, from the Abraham accord to the third temple I’m not saying he is the antichrist but he may be an antichrist. I just see how all of these agendas are long term and very well planned, and how they all lead to the same goal, a new world order, new world economy and new world religion. Pretty much anyone on the tell lie vision or media or any influencer plays a part even if it’s menial in achieving this goal, whether it’s distracting the masses or spreading disinformation or deceit or just pushing the agendas. Everything is tied together. It makes sense the symbology of Alice and wonderland, it’s an analogy to many occult things and these seams cults that have been prevelent in the background in society for thousands of years are still here today practicing all forms of satanic worship, one way I’ve seen the eye in the pyramid besides the obvious meanings is the scope of the eyes vision, it is called the all seeing eye, everyone in earth resides in the pyramid and the masses are at the bottom as useless eaters, the eye watching and the pyramid is the shape of its sight like when you point a flashlight it expands outward, and they view Lucifer as the great architect, the builder of the pyramid. Anyways it’s everywhere, at the end of the day all that matters is that Jesus is King, God is ultimately in control and the devil has already lost.


If you don’t know God, please take the time to watch this, you can come to know Him today, He loves you and sent His Son Jesus to save you

The polaris North Star is stationary. Originally astrology included; astronomy, geometry, mathematics, geography and they all treated the earth as a privileged vantage point. All things are number. God is geometer. When we take a look at Astrology, since the 1st man became ‘conscious’, astrology, has existed as a symbol system. Astrology at times has been used as a time keeping device.

181,2017 April 26th & the Occult number 13.,0.0,67i2jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/67i2jf/2017_april_26th_the_occult_number_13/,7.0,1493141415.0,"I've done some fun thinking when in bed (numerology) and I came up with something I thought was disturbing.

* (2017) 2+0+1+7 = 10 ( 1+0 ) = 1.

* (April) 0+4 = 4.
* (26th) 2+6 = 8.

* (2017) = 1.
* (April + 26th) = 4+8 = 12.

So 12 + 1 = 13. 

The number 13 you will find has many historical connections to both religion and secret societies. In particular, Christianity, the Freemasons and Knights Templars. All groups who I consider to be a Universal Brotherhood, and builders who have helped shape the world as we know it today.

In the occult, the number 13 is both a lucky number and an unlucky number. 12 is a complete number, and 13 in excess of being complete. That is why in the heavens and on earth we have 12 signs of the zodiac, 12 months of the year, 12 hours of day, 12 hours of night, 12 inches in a foot, 12 grades in school, 12 step-programs, 12 jurors, etc.

Thirteen is a number connected to the planet Venus. The planet of love and hell.
It represents femininity, because it corresponded to the number of lunar (menstrual) cycles in a year (13 x 28 = 364 days). The letter M is also 13th letter of the alphabet. The value of the letter M of Mary, center of the Latin alphabet, is 13. Likewise 13 words compose the invocation to the Virgin on the Miraculous Medal: O Mary, conceive without sin, pray for we who have recourse to you.

In the bible, The dragon, a symbol for Satan, is found 13 times in Revelation. Satan is behind all rebellion against God. The thirteenth chapter of the Revelation is reserved to the Antichrist and to the Beast.
In ancient Babylon, the Code of Hammurabi, the number 13 is omitted in the list of laws.
13 is just unnatural and 1 number above the complete number 12. As a result, our world has been thrown into chaos. An event that we can call ORDO AB CHAO, with 13 being CHAO, and 12 the ORDO we pray for.

The number 13 is very significant to the Illuminati. Each group has a core of 39 members which breaks down into 13 times 3 members. Thirteen make up an administrative group and then that group answers to a Round Table that consists of nine members.  The nine is significant because it relates the triplicate of three that is considered very important in all rituals including 3 times 3 times 3.  The 3 times 3 times 3 rules in magic apply to an amplification of the original intention of a cast ritual as well as the concept that whatever comes back to you will do so three times three times three.

Born under the sun Sign of Aquarius, Pollock is unquestionably a major league player in the Age of Aquarius. The best-loved Sign of the Zodiac, it is significant that Aquarius follows Capricorn in the order of the Zodiac. As Capricorn rules politics, so Aquarius rules parties, that is, followers. Think of Pollock as a card-carrying party member of the Abstract Expressionist movement. ""Action Painting,"" as it was popularly known, was America's first major contribution to the history of art. It is said to be quintessentially American.

Moon is in Taurus. Moon is said by astrologers to be exalted in Taurus. By that they mean the subject of such an aspect will experience conspicuous honor in life. Indeed, like a hero carried upon the shoulders of his adoring supporters, Pollock became a *cause célèbre.* Moon moves the tides, makes waves. Of the abstract painter Pollock it may be said of him without exaggerating that he made a splash. Taurus is an Earth Sign, grounded, like a lightning rod. Perhaps like a bolt of lightning would be a better simile? 

Mercury in Capricorn leads to the notion of thinking politically. Recall the archival photo images of Pollock in his studio; in many he is in motion, but in others, Pollock pauses, reflects. These photos remind me of a general plotting his campaign in a war room, as he leans over a map table, plotting. No subordinates are to be seen these photos. It’s Pollock’s war.

Sagittarius is said to be the sigh of ""living large,"" and Pollock's natal Venus shows what he really loved. Has anyone never experienced the wall-size scale of his most important paintings? New York City large, that is. Venus is the lesser good fortune planet. Behavior that would have put a mere mortal at risk didn't catch up to him until the end. 

Mars in Taurus, again the military tilt, like the pagan god of war in his culture bunker. As a matter of fact, Pollock's natal Mars is in the 29th-and-final Degree of the Sign; ""on the cusp,"" as we astrologers say.

Jupiter, the major good fortune planet, is in Sagittarius. Jupiter rules in Sagittarius, sits upon the throne there, so to speak. If Venus is a man's get-out-of-jail-for-free card, Jupiter means winnings, and considering the price of a significant Pollock, worth a king's ransom. 

With Saturn in Taurus that makes three planets in the same Sign -and the burden of fate. Saturn is the planet of major misfortune. Look at what it affects in the native's life -and his death. In the same sign as Pollock's exalted moon, Saturn afflicts that very exaltation. A slow, heavy planet, Saturn is dignified in its Sign of rulership, but in the powerful motion Sign of Taurus, it is the proverbial train wreck. It was in a car crash Pollock died. He was driving too fast for conditions and under the influence. Some say suicide. I think he was distracted by two women passengers. ",conspiracy,Zodiac

I see so many people stirred up that Ezekiel's Wheel was an Extra Terrestrial encounter.  I personally believe this to be a distraction or disinformative and very simple minded.

“As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.”


The four astrological elements of the Zodiac form a cross represented by the four creatures: Lion (Leo), Eagle (Scorpio), Man (Aquarius), and Ox (Taurus).

In older times the position held by Scorpio was depicted by an eagle or a vulture.

As the Earth rotates upon its own axis it also rotates around our Sun. The Sun rotates thru our galaxy while the galaxy simultaneously makes its own orbit through the universe.  

The Earth's rotation itself causes the appearance of rotating constellations

The entire Bible is an allegorical codex of astr- theology.  Written by the 12 disciples representing 12  zodiacs, with Christ leading the way as the Sun.

Granted I'm still learning myself, but it has everything to do with the natural flow of energies and magnetic fields throughout our universe. Alignments, conjunctions, equinoxes.  

There are reasons they are trying to block out the sun, and what it does for us.  The sun is the foundation of life. The cult of Saturn (anagram for Satan) is obviously dealing with a very negative type of energy raising of of Saturn, which was once our main sun.

And it gets trippy as fuck. Like more trippy then any Anime I have ever watched that deals with Demons and Angels. And it gets weirdly specific. Like way to specific to be just mythology yet it’s more trippy then any Sci Fi and Anime I have watched. One Grimoire that keeps coming up in online research is the Lesser Keys of Solomon. So I went and downloaded a PDF copy on my kindle and Lots of Summoning Circles in that book. Most people think that the Pentagram is the only Summoning circle. It’s not. And once again It’s a Hollywood Myth. 

I’ve always had a interest in the Paranormal and am familiar with a lot of “Species”. Of Supernatural origin. But this Demonology is entirely different. Lots of similarities but radical different. Because the Paranormal doesn’t cover how many Legions of Demons specific entities can command.  

And with Angelogy you have a entire language known as Enochian devolved by people with connections to British Royalty. I also recently came across that every persons Zodiac has a Angel specific Angel assigned to that person. 

I believe the Elites have made a deal with the Devils. Look at Joe Biden’s Campaign. He constantly said this Election was a “Battle for the Soul of the Nation”. And that he was a member of “The Light”. While other folks are members of the Dark. Then during the debates with Trump he mentioned terms like “Dark Winter”, and “aether”. 

Those aren’t normal terms people say. And ironically Joe Biden’s Zodiac sign is Scorpio. The sign most online guides rank from Angels to Devils as being at the dead bottom to Devil. And what is Joe Biden known for? Stealing a Presidential Election while having advanced Dementia, Author of the Patriot Act, and voting for the 20+ shitstorm of Iraq and Afghanistan. 

Then there’s Kamala Harris. Whose Zodiac Sign is Libra. The most senior “Light Sign.” The “purest form”. Which goes back to the campaign slogan this is a “Battle for the Soul of the Nature”. “Light and Darkness”. Kamala being the Angel and Joe being the Devil. 

The Devil is in charge now. But once the Devil disagrees with the “Angel” he will be offed. Tomorrow is March 4th. The day of reckoning. We’ve already seen reports that Kamala was not informed of the Syria bombing. And Joes already stated that if he has a “Disagreement” with Kamala he will resign. The Syria Bombing seems like that disagreement. Will we see Kamala be installed on March 4th? Or will the National Guard be in Washington forever when nothing happens? Just like on Inauguration and the Impeachment of Trump? Nothing happened like they claimed something would happen. To justify 26K National Guard troops in my Capital City.",conspiracy,Zodiac

May 2011 - poster asks Last Prophet: ""*tell me what is going on and what is the future. Please...thanks*"".

Last Prophet replies [date in brackets signals text added]:  
*Irrelevant. What* ***was*** *going on is what matters*.

**The TWO most important signs of the END of the AGE REVEALED by LAST Prophet long ago:**  

**1. First brainwashed then reduced to cattle the beasts accept to obey the orders of TRAITORS**  
Most people believe in Evolution Theory, the most important illuminati hoax to brainwash the masses.  
This is also THE most important sign of the End of the Age.  
From: ""*MAN comes from APE hoax: read these 10 lines so that you'll NEVER EVER read again 1 line by evolution 'scientists'*"":  
The only evolution ever took place at the END of the AGE: from humans to beasts alias human cattle.  
And that explains the second most important sign of the End of the Age: acceptance of traitors and nothing but traitors.

**2. Almost ⋆ ALL ⋆ world ""govs"" are DELIBERATELY working overtime to DESTROY their own people**  
In most arab countries these traitors now face armed revolts.  
[2013: In Egypt after 30 million protesters on the streets illuminati preferred to replace traitor Morsi with Sisi starting to play democrat for a while.  
They didn't dare to go for the remake of Syria, unleashing the airforce pilots against the population.]  
Not only EU, United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, China, India, Brazil but ALL G20 countries now controlled by traitors.  
And unlike World War II, this time also in Russia, where VLADIMIR PUTIN was killed and replaced with a lookalike.  
The pace for the transition to slavery was drastically increased as we entered illuminati overtime in 2007.  
Yet the traitors face no REAL organized opposition, only fake protest movements (from ""Occupy movement"" to Greenpeace) and fake opposition parties (from ""neo-nazis"" to ""communists"").

The explanation for this unprecedented situation in History: all these G20 traitors face a **population almost entirely reduced to human cattle**.  
No wonder that they weren't able to recognize the Beast that marked them, although it's **much easier to recognize the Beast than ever before**.

**CONTEXT**   
The Astrology hoax - not only for making naive waist their time but a mind control weapon  
As some of the illusions used to control the minds of people turn to be less and less efficient (like UFOs & Co.), the system uses always more and more astrology.  
Once you believe in astrology, you give up the capacity to think.  
This leads people to not react to even primary events - the ones where their survival is at stake.

**“Since 1999, humankind will be divided into two. Society as well. Humankind and the world will be divided into two polarizations. In  every way, severe polarization will happen.**  

**The colossal experiment field will be the East.**

**The creation is not yet finished.** 

**Especially about humankind.** 

**Humankind is at a new door that will step up to a next new level.**

**This is a superhuman race.**

**They are about to become a new superhuman race.** 

**This is by a completely natural science mutant.**

**And the great catastrophe will follow. The day of the iron cross will be coming.**

**It will happen at the end of the 20th century. But, there will be no such Jesus Christ of salvation.** 

**Another savior will come. When it comes, the thing that saves humankind is the ones that are beyond humankind.**

**They will create a new world and new religion.**

**In 2039, humankind disappears.**

**This is because humankind will evolve into a new thing or be degenerated.** 

**In detail, some of humankind will have evolved into an existence that is close to God. They possess more intelligence and power than the current humankind that even cannot be compared.**

**They unite and govern the Earth.**

**But the rest of humankind will become a sorta of machine.**

**They just work by operation or enjoy; they are perfectly ‘Bionic Robots’.**

**And they cannot recognize given facts that are manipulated.** 

**But they think they have a choice and can live whatever they want, with their consciousness.** 

**But in fact, the new race (like God - GodHuman) sees through everything and breeds them like livestock in large farms.** 

**This is why humankind will be divided into two, like sky and land.**

**Until 2999, the world will be completed by complete gods and bio robots; in the land, bio robots live, and Gods govern them in the Universe.**

**According to his writing ‘mein kampf’, he said:**

**..This is why people rely on Jesus Chirst or Jehovah.** 

**But those things will never come. This is nothing but the illusion of Judea or Christantiy.**

**I SURELY SAY, that kind of savior will never come.**

**Instead, humankind will give birth to the superhuman race or God-human & something like or close to God.** 

**Even if they take poison or fatal rays, they will not die.** 

**This is because their organs and nerves have evolved into a new level of dimension.**

**Since 2103, a new era will have begun.** 

**…….**

**After some period passes, the current sun will be exploded and separated (Separated parts will not be visible)**

**AND NEW SECOND SUN WILL APPEAR THAT IS UNIMAGINABLE.**

**The size of this sun is not immeasurable,**

**The burning thermal energy will light up the whole universe, like afternoon.**

**And the backside of the first separated sun will be sucked into the second sun, and the eternal world unfolds.**  

**Then… ALL beings will stand in front of the person.**

**Some are with happiness, some are with fear….**

**Since then, they will have no such hate or war.**

**In the end, the earth and the sky (probably the universe and the world) will go away, and every being will live in the arms of God.** 

 

**Hitler said that he had been influenced by Tibet esoteric Buddishm and a secret group named** ***Tulet*****.**

**And he said that he had a spiritual interchange with ‘*****what’s his name’*** **; hitler said that** ***what’s his name*** **told him about his future and then Jews will govern this earth etc etc.**

**While Red Army was rushing into the heart of Berlin, on Radio, he said that:**

**German people must be defeated for the greatest eastern people that will be coming. Last Battalion will appear from an eastern country. Humankind will have a new end, and a new beginning. This is….”**

&#x200B;

One of the interesting analysis on it is, 

2039 will be the new year & new beginning of new sun. Supplying new type of humankind on the new era is unavoidable - and he says it's a necessary evil. 

Eventually, everything will become one then go to middle god.

Things are getting chaotic more than ever before. Q's latest post (which is under control of Jesuits) was about DNA which is unusual and strange, and on Nov 27, it mentioned prophet.

Jesuits' origin was the 6th humankind that decided to follow Elohim (Anunnaki & Domain) very very long time ago. Several years ago, some part of Freemason and the majority of member of Jesuits decided to work together (This is why there were no such mass arrest that many q's followers wanted and believed).

For some people who want to understand it more

In conspiracy theory world, Nibiru is closing to Earth again very soon. And according to KGB file, it says 'you will see the beginning it on 2017 and the end on 2022'. And one of the alien groups are supposed to appear themselves to humankind in an open manner (maybe it could be project blue beam - and the alien group is not Elohim - Anunnaki - Domain).

Let's go back to Q's latest posting

 What is coded in your DNA?  
Who put it there?  
Why?  
Mankind is repressed.  
We will be repressed no more.  
Information is knowledge.  
Knowledge is power.  
Information is power.  
How do you protect your DNA?  
There is a war for your DNA.  
Protect your DNA.  
Ascension.  
Q 

&#x200B;

**Protect your DNA.**

Elohim was the alien group which evolved apes for their profit and experiment. 6th humankind was evolved in order to  construct architectures and make energy, this is why that things are inevitably subordinated to 'matter'. In comparison to them, the 7th humankind was surprisingly evolved to experiment 'spirit'. So the mechanism is totally different, and the 6th humankind want to solve this mystery for their survive and **ascension.** There were wars between the 6th humankind (Freemason) with reptile groups and Elohim. Elohim won then they begun the experiment 'spirit' on the 7th humankind; but they deliberately made the 7th humankind filtering ability weak due to the case of the 6th humankind. Survived 6th humankind (Jesuits) was assigned to help the 7th humankind.

Oneday, suddenly, Elohim left. Probably some big event made them leave the earth. Then FM and reptile groups one by one came out and started to expand their territory on this planet. The jesuits group were shocked because they were left; they couldn't believe they were being left and not chosen to go together with Elohim.

Some decided to work with FM and most of them literally gave up helping the 7th humankind. Around 6000 years ago, the 7th humankind was defeated and all the history has been erased and distorted and then cultivated (This is why there are many mysteries in history).

Later, Jesuits realized their mistake then rebegun fighting against FM and reptile group again, and helpthe 7th humankind in their own way, especially since the born of Jesus (The age of Pisces) but in a distorted way; The real teaching of bible and Jesus was completely distorted at First Council of Nicaea) because they don't want the 7th humankind to find the real history - their purpose is, to show how much the 7th humankind has been upgraded even in this worst situation that the 7th humankind has been cultivated by their enemy (FM and reptile group).

But most of them decided to work with FM several years ago. It means they involved in having people taking this vaxx. Then they say now 'Protect your DNA?' WTF. Are they spilt again? 

At least, do they want to prove that they dedicated themselves for having some people not taking vxx, even if they are few? 

\---

If someone asks me: Which groups do you support? -> I'm a poor man in the 7th humankind but not support them. And hate all. Elohim which is creep too. Anunnaki as well and Domain, which is the current powerful political group in 'Elohim'. But.. sometimes I think it'll be cool if I have a reptilian girl friend that can do shapeshift so I can have different beatiful lady every day even 2d anima version as well

200,"Daya's ""Sit Still, Look Pretty"" is about Hillary Clinton",0.0,ai2b0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ai2b0j/dayas_sit_still_look_pretty_is_about_hillary/,0.0,1548018252.0,"The first time I ever listened to Daya’s song *Sit Still Look Pretty* was shortly after its release in March of 2016. It was my Junior year of highschool, I was 17 at the time, and I was driving home in my parent’s 2006, remember that, 2006 blue Toyota Minivan from my job at Yo Mama’s Frozen Yogurt. I didn’t love the job, but I definitely stole my paycheck’s worth in frozen yogurt and ice cream when no one was looking. I left that job soon after, I would call it a mutual leave, others say I got fired, but that’s a different story for a different time. 

So I finished closing up for the night at around 10pm. I finish throwing out the plastic spoons that we would bullshit all our customers into believing that we actually recycled, but, like why would we do that? Do you really want the possibility of Oconomowoc spit bacteria mixing with Milwaukee spit bacteria? That would be embarrassing. So, I get in the 2006 Blue Toyota Minivan and I went to plug in the aux cord to my phone, but my phone was at 22% and I didn’t want to drain the battery from streaming Taylor Swift’s “Red” Album (I was in a phase at the time). So I turned on my radio to Milwaukee’s own 103.7’s Kiss FM, and there it began, Daya’s brand new song; *Sit Still Look Pretty*. I wasn’t familiar with Daya or any of her other music, I was more of a comedy music type kid. But I knew in that moment, as  Daya’s *Sit Still Look Pretty* went from beginning to end, I knew it wasn’t just any normal song. It wasn’t an anthem for herself, nor women in general, but, in that moment, I knew wholeheartedly, that Daya’s 2016 hit single, *Sit Still Look Pretty*, was really, truly about Hillary Clinton and her role in the 2016 Presidential Election.

Now, before we even get into the details and nitty gritty of this whole unproven to be wrong theory, neigh, fact, you may be asking yourself, how do Hillary and Grace Tandon, AKA Daya, even connect? How do they go together as people? And where did Daya’s intent even stem from? Well, for starters, both Hillary and Daya were born in, you guessed it, October. Daya on October 24, 1998, and Hillary on October 26, 1947, (don’t forget those dates). Now, since they were both born in October, that makes them both Scorpios. So what does that even mean? Well, there are 12 Zodiac signs, Scorpio is the 8th of the 12, and each specific zodiac sign comes with believed traits. Hillary and Daya, according to their sign, are believed to have the traits of being focused, brave, intuitive, ambitious, and faithful. All of which are *essential* traits when it comes to carrying yourself to accomplish something huge, whether it’s trying to make it big in the music industry, or deciding to run for President of the United States, it’s something that only a Scorpio would do. 

Fun side note: since both were born in October, if you really sit back, break out your calculator, really take the time to do the math, and go back 9 months, as in both Hillary and Daya’s conceptions, it looks like their parents had quite the romantic Valentine’s Day, but I’m not just pointing that out as a “fun side note” as previously stated. It actually brings up a pressing, stand-out, necessary, big-league question: Were Hillary Clinton’s and Daya’s entire existences created by complete mistake? Their lives started accidentally by a faulty condom? A condom with a hole? With a rip?  Very similar to the faulty holes and or rips in our Music Industry and Political system today? Who put the pin through the condom? Was it Trump? The Mainstream Media? Daya’s evil twin named “Ayad”? No one truly knows, but what we do know is that both women are here, ready to rule the world.

Fast forward. Hillary announced her Presidential Campaign for the 2016 Election in 2015, the exact same year that Grace Tandon seemingly decided to officially go by the stage name of Daya. Even more astonishing? They were born just 51 years apart! 51! Most would call this some bullshit luck, but it really is truly just nothing but 100% fact. Dig deeper, and you’ll find that the reverse number of 51 is 15, making 2015 the most life changing year for both of these women. Born the same month? Taking the world by storm in the same year? You’d think this is all the proof that I have, and it would be enough, yes, but you’d be wrong. Sit back and relax, my friend, this is just the beginning. 

At first listen, *Sit Still Look Pretty* is nothing but a feel good empowering song for all women everywhere, but give it a second listen, and it becomes something extremely different. The first line to catch your attention comes right away in the song, “Could dress up / To get love / But guess what? / I'm never gonna be that girl / Who's living in a Barbie world.” Never gonna be that girl. Girl - Hillary Clinton, check. Never gonna be that girl who’s living in a Barbie world. We all know Barbie, and many of us cannot even imagine a world without her. Barbie was founded in 1959 by one Ruth Handler. Remember how I said remembering Hillary’s birthday was going to come in handy? Well, Hillary was born in 1947, that’s 8 years before anyone even knew what a Barbie was, so for 8 years, Hillary Rodham Clinton WAS NOT THAT GIRL WHO’S LIVING IN A BARBIE WORLD. And, in Daya’s music video, as she is singing those lyrics, there is even more of a direct call out to Hillary, as Daya is seen wearing a *straitjacket*, not only does that prove itself interesting when a simple google of “Hillary Clinton Lesbian?” (i.e. “not straight”) leads you to over a whopping 8 million results. And of course those results were all due to her infamous pantsuits, something that Daya has even been seen wearing herself. But also, a straitjacket is something that most Trump supporters wouldn’t mind seeing Hillary in as they proudly chant “LOCK HER UP!” *Lock Her Up*. But lock her up, where? A prison? A straitjacket? In a straitjacket while also in a prison? Or, in a straitjacket while also making a guest appearance in Daya’s music video? We may never truly know these answers.

But what we all do know, is that everyone thought Hillary was a shoe-in to win the election. In fact, the highest recorded percentage of Hillary’s chance of winning was 91%, 91 percent! 91, that number is meaningful in all of this, especially when you go back and look at both Daya’s and Hillary’s birthdays again, yet confirming for those dates to be relevant factors throughout. Daya, born October 1998, making her 20 years old, and Hillary Clinton, October 1947, making her 71 years old. Now, again, with her 91% chance at winning the election, it only leaves you with the two previous numbers mentioned, 20 and 71, 71 and 20, when added together, \*AHEM\*, 91, THE EXACT SAME PERCENTAGE IN WHICH HILLARY’S CHANCES WERE FOR BECOMING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. And the coincidences, if that’s what you care to call them, they don’t stop there. 

*Sit Still Look Pretty* then continues with the line, “Could wake up / And make up / And play dumb / Pretending that I need a boy / Who's gonna treat me like a toy.” And I’m sure we all know of which boy Daya is referencing to, yeah, that’s right, Bill Clinton. In January of 1998, the Monica Lewinsky scandal came to light. So what do we have? We have a corrupt marriage between Hillary & Bill Clinton, and then we have a scandal between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. We have a marriage, and we have a scandal. Scandal, Marriage, Marriage, Scandal. Why are these two words so important? Well, if you assign each letter in the word “Scandal” a number, with A being 1, B being 2, C being 3, and so on, and then you add up the values of each letter, and the word “Scandal” equals 54, remember that, “Scandal” equals 54. Now we do the same thing to the word “marriage”, assigning a value to each letter, adding it up, and the word “Marriage” has the grand total of 71. 71! Now, not only is that the age of Hillary Clinton, again, proving itself to be an important number in all of this, but if you take that 71, and you subtract the sum of the word “Scandal”, so 71-54, you get, that’s right, 17. Now, what is so important about that is, not only is 17 just 71 flipped around, but if you take the number 71 and you rotate it 180°, something really interesting happens. That 71 that we all are so familiar with turns into the letters I and L, capital IL, IL (ill), or to majority of Americans, it’s the abbreviation for the state of Illinois, the same exact state in which Hillary Clinton grew up. Who else in politics is famously from the state of Illinois, you ask? Well, it’s the Obamas’. The Obamas’ met Daya while she performed at the White House Easter Egg Roll on March 28th, 2016, just ONE DAY before *Sit Still, Look Pretty* was officially released. Now, is all of this really JUST a crazy-random-happen-stance? At this point, that seems to be too far fetched.

As *Sit Still, Look Pretty* continues, we finally get to the chorus, “Oh, I don't know what you've been told / But this gal right here's gonna rule the world / Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be / No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty.” Daya clearly knows what we’ve been told since the dawn of man, and it’s that women can’t do anything. Notice how I said, “since the dawn of *man”*, and not “the dawn of women”. Women can’t even get their own saying. Sure, progress is being made, but at one point, women couldn’t vote, couldn’t have a job, we just recently let a woman play The Doctor on BBC’s “Doctor Who”. But even in 2019, there’s still a large amount of people that believe The White House is no place for a woman, unless you’re on the kitchen staff. But both Hillary and Daya are fighting that idea, they’re not just going to “Sit still \[and\] look pretty”, they’re going to move, move fast, and not give a damn if they look hot enough to fry an egg on or not.

Next is the second verse, Daya sings the lyrics, “Then Snow White / She did it right / In her life / Had seven men to do the chores / 'Cause that's not what a lady's for.” Now, the first notable point in this verse is Daya’s mention of Snow White, a female, a princess, and the fact that she had *seven* *men* doing *her* chores. SEVEN men doing her chores. Now, not only is that reverse gender roles right there, fighting and getting us one step closer to solving sexism, but Snow White having specifically seven men doing her chores is extremely interesting. If you take the word seven, and convert it with the same letters to numbers system as we did with the words “marriage” and “scandal”, the sum of the word “seven” is 65. Even more interesting, if you take the number 65, 6 and 5, and you perform the reverse conversion, or in other words, now turning those numbers into letters, the number 65 spells out Fe (fee), or Fe, the chemical symbol for iron. Now, why is iron so important to this whole thing? Well it all goes back to 2008, the first year that Hillary was running for President, and in front of a crowd of about 700 people in Salem, New Hampshire, while Hillary was giving her address, a man in the crowd started screaming, you guessed it, “*IRON* my shirt, *IRON* my shirt.” And what is even more striking, the first man screaming “IRON my shirt!” is joined by a second man chanting the very same thing. Collectively, they scream “IRON my shirt” THIRTEEN times. Thirteen. This now adds an additional extra extraordinary “wow” factor when you take into account that Fe, the chemical symbol for *iron*, has an atomic number of 26. Now, let’s rewind this so we can see it in a clearer light. 2 men, both screaming “Iron My Shirt!” 13 times. 2 men, 13 chants. 13 x 2, is motherflucking 26, which is equal to that of the atomic number of Iron. Coincidence? Or has this all been mapped out for 11 years?

Now, take that 26, put two zeros in the middle and that brings us back to 2006, not only the same year as my Parent’s Blue Toyota Minivan (yeah, that’s right, we’re coming full circle here), but then add 2, which is the number of how many main candidates there were for the Presidential Election. You add that number to 2006 and you then get 2008, the year of the cinematic release of Marvel’s *IRON* man. Iron Man, whose secret identity is Tony Stark, his initials are TS, which are the shared initials of beloved singer/songwriter Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift, as we all know, had a hit song called 22, which has its own astounding connection to all this, being that not only, reminder, my phone was at 22% when I first heard Daya's *Sit Still Look Pretty*, but there’s another reason too. It’s that the last lyric, before the repetitive chorus that ultimately ends the song, much like how Hillary has repeatedly run for president, ultimately leaving her in defeat, that final lyric before that chorus is, “Call me HBIC”, HBIC. Now, for the many that do not know, HBIC is an acronym for “Head Bitch In Charge”, not only is this another statement of power, but if you apply the same letters to numbers conversion yet again to the acronym HBIC, you get, you guessed it, 22. Is your mind blown yet? Because this number’s significance isn’t quite yet finished. During the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election, which we’re all sure Hillary Clinton will throw her hat in the ring for, Daya will be, no other age than, yeah, that’s right, fucking 22. 

As you can see, Daya’s role in the life of Hillary Clinton and her Presidential Runs couldn’t get any closer unless they were Trump and Putin’s budding bromance. And she thought no one would see? That we’re blind? That we’ve never played connect the dots with our own, or even a stranger’s freckles before?

In my last post I predicted 18 July 2023 as the date for World War 3

One of the reasons is that Globalists favour starting wars with dates that add to 68

WAR STARTS= 68

World war 1 : Started 28/7/1914 = 28 + 7 + 19 + 14 = 68

World war 2: Started 1/9/1939 = 1 + 9 + 19 + 39 = 68

Putin's Invasion started: 24/02/2022= 24 + 2 + 20 + 22 = 68

World War 3: 18/7/2023= 18 + 7+ 20 + 23= 68

&#x200B;

But there's another 68 date

17 Aug 2023= 17 + 8 + 20 +23= 68

17 Aug= 229th day of the year

WORLD WAR HAS STARTED= 229

17 Aug= 57 days after the Summer Solstice 21 June= 21/6

17 Aug= 77 weeks after Putin's Invasion

17 Aug= 44 days after 4 July

17 Aug= 119 days after Hitler's birth date

17 Aug= 11 months + 9 days after the Queen's death

DEATH OF A QUEEN= 229

&#x200B;

One of the ways I predict Globalists will signal this date is by a huge earthquake in San Francisco

220,George Floyd Masonic / Numeric / Symbolic Mega Post,0.0,h8uiio,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/h8uiio/george_floyd_masonic_numeric_symbolic_mega_post/,426.0,1592143877.0,"The ritual killing lasted 8 minutes and 46 seconds.  Numerically, the digits add up to 18, which is 6+6+6.

The ritual occurred on ‪East 38th Street‬, which is on the same street as the “Prince Hall Grand Lodge”, 1/2 mile away. This is a Masonic Lodge for black people. George Floyd’s family hired “Benjamin Crump”, as their lawyer, who is listed as a famous Prince Hall Freemason. George Floyd’s twin friend, ex-NBA player Stephen Jackson is also connected to the Masonic fraternity. 

The riots began on ‪East 33rd Street‬, next to garbage-can with 666 painted on it. This was in the city of ‪Minneapolis, Minnesota‬, which has the same acronym “MM” as “Master Mason”. If you flip MM sideways you get 33, the highest degree in the Scottish rite of Freemasonry.  33 is the age Jesus died.  33 reduces to 6.

In the 3rd degree of Freemasonry, Masons are introduced to a character called Hiram Abiff. In Masonic lore, Hiram Abiff is the builder of Solomon’s temple, and is nicknamed the “Widow’s Son”. All Freemasons are designated as “Sons of the Widow”. In Masonic lore, Hiram Abiff is murdered by three ruffians. This ritual is acted out by Master Masons, which involves staging the murder of a candidate.

During his arrest, three police officers (three ruffians) kneeled on George Floyd’s body, while he was gasping for air. Derek Chauvin, the police officer, who took the blame for Floyd’s death, was originally charged with third-degree murder – fitting for a third-degree Masonic ritual. At one point, Derek Chauvin and Floyd were working security at the same night club. I suspect Derek Chauvin is a fake-name, and that he is a crisis actor, who may have been used in other False Flags events.  Photographs have surfaced with an identical man at the boston marathon bombing.  The reality of crisis actors is validated and irrefutable.  People have been tried and convicted for inciting violence at major events and in their testimony confessed to coercion with govt and intelligence agencies.  An important cultural event such as the George Floyd death would asbolutely warrant foul play.  The cop shown in the viral video went missing for weeks after the incident and his neighbors never saw him in a police uniform.

The ritual occurred on Memorial Day, which honors those killed defending our country. During Masonic rituals, Masons kneel before the grave of Hiram Abiff, as a ‘memorial’. At George Floyd’s funeral, many kneeled before his golden casket. In solidarity with the BLM protests, Nancy Pelosi, alongside fellow Democrats, wore African kente cloth, and kneeled – 8 minutes and 46 seconds – at the capitol. 

The name “George” means “farmer” or “earth-worker”. This gives us a clue – as to his symbolic identity. George Floyd was cast in the role of Hiram Abiff, who represents Osiris. Osiris was the Egyptian god of fertility, vegetation, and the cycles of nature. In ancient Egypt, agriculture depended on its summer floods, which fertilized the land. Perhaps this is why George Floyd pleaded for water, not because he was thirsty. According to Egyptian legends, Osiris was murdered by Set, the god of Chaos. The number eight represents chaos magick. After the ritual was completed, the world experienced total mayhem. All of the looting, rioting, and anarchy were done in the name of the widow’s son George Floyd. 

According to certain Egyptian legends, Osiris died while being locked in a golden casket. This represents the death of the Sun. Osiris is the Black Sun or ‪Midnight Sun.‬ This is in contrast, to Horus the Risen Sun, Ra the Noonday Sun, and Set – the Setting Sun. 

Celebrities who obsess with gold or covering themselves in gold are emulating gods.  It is said that gold is the flesh of gods.

During his death speech, George Floyd said “I can’t breathe” 12 times (solar number). He also cried out to his mama, who had been dead for two years. Masons, however, have a grand hailing sign of distress – and may plead with their brethren by asking: “Is there no help for the widow’s son?” George Floyd was calling out to Isis – the goddess of the mysteries, who became a widow upon the death of Osiris.

In his final minutes, George Floyd tells the policemen he is “claustrophobic”, which is strange under his circumstances, but not for someone being locked in a casket. The autopsy revealed, George Floyd died of asphyxiation or suffocation. 

Similar to the sun god Osiris, George Floyd was buried in a golden casket. His body was transported by a horse-drawn carriage, which is another solar symbol – as solar deities are often depicted riding a chariot across the skies. 

Floyd Mayweather is paying for all four of his funerals, which are in Minneapolis (North), Houston (South), Charlotte (East), and the fourth to be announced (West?). “Floyd”, “May” and “Weather” in his name – would bankroll four funerals.  The symbolism here – alludes to the four cardinal points and the four seasons in the solar year. 2020 also reduces to 4.

George Floyd’s final resting spot is Pearland, which is symbolic of Upper Egypt – the kingdom of Set, the god of Chaos. The scorpion macehead or scepter of Upper Egypt was pear-shaped. The pear belongs to a family of fruit, which includes the Quince, a golden fruit—that is said to be the forbidden fruit of Eden – that leads to gnosis. 

In his death speech, George Floyd mentions five body parts that hurt – his face, neck, nuts, knees, and stomach. The Freemasons do a ritual that involves five-points of fellowship – which are the face, foot, knee, breast, and back. While Masons probably don’t grab each other’s testicles, the word “big feet” is a euphemism for being well-endowed, so the “foot” and “sexual organs” are linked. That being said, Freemasons have some liberty as to where they touch each other, the key here – is that there are five points of contact. 

As previously discussed, eight represents “chaos magick”. In Chaldean numerology, the number 46 represents the crown chakra. Considering, the word “corona” means “crown” – this fits perfectly. George Floyd not only got photographed standing by a corona beer poster, but he also tested positive for coronavirus. From an astrological perspective, we are entering into the Age of Aquarius, an air sign, explaining the attack on our minds.  CORONA = CROWN = MIND.

The number 846 refers to ‪8:46 pm‬, the time of the sunset at Minneapolis on May 25th. Allegorically, this is when Osiris is killed by Set.  The attack on the Twin Towers began ‪at 8:46 am‬. Since Minneapolis, along with St. Paul – make up the twin cities, this connects the two rituals. This gives us twin towers, twin cities, and twin brothers.

9/11/2001 and 5/25/2020 are *6831 days apart.

6 + 8 + 3 + 1 = 18 • 
6 + 6 + 6 = 18

Every day at sunset, the sun is allegorically killed – and descends into the underworld – the world of chaos. This is the domain of the black-sun Osiris.  George Floyd represents “Osiris”. He has the Masonic “Ordo Ab Chao"" tattooed on his chest.  This is Latin for “Order out of Chaos”.  Which is the foundation of American Military Mind Control Complex and the immediate aftermath of these riots.  Immediate Military Order from the Chaos.

The ritual was recorded from the Dragon Wok restaurant while “Scorpio” was rising on the Eastern horizon. Allegorically, the Sun is killed each day by Scorpio, which is depicted as a “scorpion, dragon, or serpent”. It is also the “serpent” that tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit – the Quince – which is called Pyrus Cydonia.

Another major event will be the Ring of Fire at the summer solstice. The summer solstice is the climax of the sun’s journey north – to the tropic of Cancer, which involves maximum light. This year, the Sun and the Moon will be united at the summer solstice, in the zodiac sign of Cancer, making a ring of fire. This is a rare event. Some consider this a bad omen, as the eclipse will darken the “longest day of the year”. Esoterically, eclipses represent a celestial marriage, as the sun and moon are united, which creates a perfect balance of masculine and feminine energies. The child born of this alchemical wedding will become manifested in the first full moon of summer – which is the Buck Moon ‪on July 5th.‬",conspiracy,Zodiac

I'm an undecided voter about to partake in the primaries in Washington state. I have opinions on the candidates, but I haven't really delved into the specifics of their policies (example: I know Trump wants to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it, but I don't know the justification of how that is going to work. Or, I know Sanders wants a $15/hour min wage, but I don't know how he plans to combat inflation).

I've had a few conversations with different voters, and while it is interesting hearing why they are voting for the candidate they are, it seems more interesting (to me, personally) sometimes to hear why they aren't voting for certain ones.

So. Pick a candidate you don't want elected, and explain why their policies are grounds for not supporting them. Be specific, and focus on policies- okay, Trump is racist, Sanders is socialist, Clinton can't be trusted, Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer, and John Kasich is....there...but what is it about their policies specifically that makes you not want to see them elected?

1,[Long Post] What does William Blum get wrong about Cuba?,8.0,mrlf6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/mrlf6y/long_post_what_does_william_blum_get_wrong_about/,5.0,1618512930.0,"In his book Killing Hope, he discusses US actions against Cuba, I'd like to know what he gets wrong. I'll provide a link to the full chapter in the comments. I'll quote it at length. This is a long post but I'd like to know where people think he gets something wrong.

>The existence of a revolutionary socialist government with growing  ties to the Soviet Union only 90 miles away, insisted the United States  Government, was a situation which no self-respecting superpower should  tolerate, and in 1961 it undertook an invasion of Cuba.  
>  
>But less than 50 miles from the Soviet Union sat Pakistan, a close  ally of the United States, a member since 1955 of the South-East Asia  Treaty Organization (SEATO), the US-created anti-communist alliance.  On  the very border of the Soviet Union was Iran, an even closer ally of  the United States, with its relentless electronic listening posts,  aerial surveillance, and infiltration into Russian territory by American  agents. And alongside Iran, also bordering the Soviet Union, was  Turkey, a member of the Russians’ mortal enemy, NATO, since 1951.  
>  
>In 1962 during the “Cuban Missile Crisis”, Washington, seemingly in a  state of near-panic, informed the world that the Russians were  installing “offensive” missiles in Cuba.  The US promptly instituted a  “quarantine” of the island – a powerful show of naval and marine forces  in the Caribbean would stop and search all vessels heading towards Cuba;  any found to contain military cargo would be forced to turn back.  
>  
>The United States, however, had missiles and bomber bases already in  place in Turkey and other missiles in Western Europe pointed toward the  Soviet Union.  Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev later wrote:  
>  
>The Americans had surrounded our country with military bases and  threatened us with nuclear weapons, and now they would learn just what  it feels like to have enemy missiles pointing at you; we’d be doing  nothing more than giving them a little of their own medicine. … After  all, the United States had no moral or legal quarrel with us. We hadn’t  given the Cubans anything more than the Americans were giving to their  allies. We had the same rights and opportunities as the Americans. Our  conduct in the international arena was governed by the same rules and  limits as the Americans.     
>  
>Lest anyone misunderstand, as Khrushchev apparently did, the rules under which Washington was operating, *Time*  magazine was quick to explain.  ”On the part of the Communists,” the  magazine declared, “this equating \[referring to Khrushchev’s offer to  mutually remove missiles and bombers from Cuba and Turkey\] had obvious  tactical motives.  On the part of neutralists and pacifists \[who  welcomed Khrushchev’s offer\] it betrayed intellectual and moral  confusion.”  The confusion lay, it seems, in not seeing clearly who were  the good guys and who were the bad guys, for “The purpose of the U.S.  bases \[in Turkey\] was not to blackmail Russia but to strengthen the  defense system of NATO, which had been created as a safeguard against  Russian aggression. As a member of NATO, Turkey welcomed the bases as a  contribution to her own defense.”  Cuba, which had been invaded only the  year before, could have, it seems, no such concern.  Time continued its  sermon: Beyond these differences between the two cases, there is an  enormous moral difference between U.S. and Russian objectives … To  equate U.S. and Russian bases is in effect to equate U.S. and Russian  purposes … The U.S. bases, such as those in Turkey, have helped keep the  peace since World War II, while the Russian bases in Cuba threatened to  upset the peace. The Russian bases were intended to further conquest  and domination, while U.S. bases were erected to preserve freedom. The  difference should have been obvious to all.     
>  
>Equally obvious was the right of the United States to maintain a  military base on Cuban soil – Guantánamo Naval Base by name, a vestige  of colonialism staring down the throats of the Cuban people, which the  US, to this day, refuses to vacate despite the vehement protest of the  Castro government.  
>  
>After the Cuban Revolution in January 1959, we learned that there are  also good and bad hijackings.  On several occasions Cuban planes and  boats were hijacked to the United States but they were not returned to  Cuba, nor were the hijackers punished.  Instead, some of the planes and  boats were seized by US authorities for non-payment of debts claimed by  American firms against the Cuban government.     But then there were the bad hijackings – planes forced to fly from the  United States to Cuba.  When there began to be more of these than  flights in the opposite direction, Washington was obliged to reconsider  its policy.  
>  
>It appears that there are as well good and bad terrorists. When the  Israelis bombed PLO headquarters in Tunis in 1985, Ronald Reagan  expressed his approval.  The president asserted that nations have the  right to retaliate against terrorist attacks “as long as you pick out  the people responsible”.     
>  
>But if Cuba had dropped bombs on any of the headquarters of the  anti-Castro exiles in Miami or New Jersey, Ronald Reagan would likely  have gone to war, though for 25 years the Castro government had been on  the receiving end of an extraordinary series of terrorist attacks  carried out in Cuba, in the United States, and in other countries by the  exiles and their CIA mentors.  (We shall not discuss the consequences  of Cuba bombing CIA headquarters.)  
>  
>Bombing and strafing attacks of Cuba by planes based in the United States began in October 1959, if not before.      In early 1960, there were several fire-bomb air raids on Cuban cane  fields and sugar mills, in which American pilots also took part – at  least three of whom died in crashes, while two others were captured.   The State Department acknowledged that one plane which crashed, killing  two Americans, had taken off from Florida, but insisted that it was  against the wishes of the US government.     
>  
>In March a French freighter unloading munitions from Belgium exploded  in Havana taking 75 lives and injuring 200, some of whom subsequently  died.  The United States denied Cuba’s accusation of sabotage but  admitted that it had sought to prevent the shipment.     
>  
>And so it went … reaching a high point in April of the following year  in the infamous CIA-organized invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs. Over  100 exiles died in the attack.  Close to 1,200 others were taken  prisoner by the Cubans.  It was later revealed that four American pilots  flying for the CIA had lost their lives as well.     
>  
>Despite the fact that the Kennedy administration was acutely  embarrassed by the unmitigated defeat – indeed, because of it – a  campaign of smaller-scale attacks upon Cuba was initiated almost  immediately, under the rubric of Operation Mongoose.   Throughout the  1960s, the Caribbean island was subjected to  countless sea and air  commando raids by exiles, at times  accompanied by their CIA  supervisors, inflicting damage upon oil refineries, chemical plants and  railroad bridges, cane fields, sugar mills and sugar warehouses;  infiltrating spies, saboteurs and assassins … anything to damage the  Cuban economy, promote disaffection, or make the revolution look bad …  taking the lives of Cuban militia members and others in the process …   pirate attacks on Cuban fishing boats and merchant ships, bombardments  of Soviet vessels docked in Cuba, an assault upon a Soviet army camp  with 12 Russian soldiers reported wounded … a hotel and a theatre  shelled from offshore because Russians and East Europeans were supposed  to be present there …     
>  
>These actions were not always carried out on the direct order of the  CIA or with its foreknowledge, but the Agency could hardly plead “rogue  elephant”.  It had created Operation Mongoose headquarters in Miami that  was truly a state within a city – over, above, and outside the laws of  the United States, not to mention international law, with a staff of  several hundred Americans directing many more Cuban agents in just such  types of actions, with a budget in excess of $50 million a year, and an  arrangement with the local press to keep operations in Florida secret  except when the CIA wanted something publicized.     
>  
>Title 18 of the US Code declares it to be a crime to launch a  “military or naval expedition or enterprise” from the United States  against a country with which the United States is not (officially) at  war. Although US authorities now and then aborted an exile plot or  impounded a boat – sometimes because the Coast Guard or other officials  had not been properly clued in – no Cubans were prosecuted under this  act.  This was no more than to be expected inasmuch as Attorney General  Robert Kennedy had determined after the Bay of Pigs that the invasion  did not constitute a military expedition.     
>  
>The commando raids were combined with a total US trade and credit  embargo, which continues to this day, and which genuinely hurt the Cuban  economy and chipped away at the society’s standard of living. So  unyielding has the embargo been that when Cuba was hard hit by a  hurricane in October 1963, and Casa Cuba, a New York social club, raised  a large quantity of clothing for relief, the United States refused to  grant it an export license on the grounds that such shipment was  “contrary to the national interest”.     
>  
>Moreover, pressure was brought to bear upon other countries to  conform to the embargo, and goods destined for Cuba were sabotaged:  machinery damaged, chemicals added to lubricating fluids to cause rapid  wear on diesel engines, a manufacturer in West Germany paid to produce  ball-bearings off-center, another to do the same with balanced wheel  gears – “You’re talking about big money,” said a CIA officer involved in  the sabotage efforts, “when you ask a manufacturer to go along with you  on that kind of project because he has to reset his whole mold.  And he  is probably going to worry about the effect on future business.  You  might have to pay him several hundred thousand dollars or more.”     
>  
>One manufacturer who defied the embargo was the British Leyland  Company, which sold a large number of buses to Cuba in 1964. Repeated  expressions of criticism and protest by Washington officials and  Congressmen failed to stem deliveries of some of the buses.  Then, in  October, an East German cargo ship carrying another 42 buses to Cuba  collided in thick fog with a Japanese vessel in the Thames. The Japanese  ship was able to continue on, but the cargo ship was beached on its  side; the buses would have to be “written off”, said the Leyland  company.  In the leading British newspapers it was just an accident  story.     In the *New York Times*  it was not even reported. A decade was to pass before the American  columnist Jack Anderson disclosed that his CIA and National Security  Agency sources had confirmed that the collision had been arranged by the  CIA with the cooperation of British intelligence.      Subsequently, another CIA officer stated that he was skeptical about  the collision story, although admitting that “it is true that we were  sabotaging the Leyland buses going to Cuba from England, and that was  pretty sensitive business.”     
>  
>What undoubtedly was an even more sensitive venture was the use of  chemical and biological weapons against Cuba by the United States. It is  a remarkable record.  
>  
>a Canadian agricultural technician working as an  adviser to the Cuban government was paid $5,000 by “an American military  intelligence agent” to infect Cuban turkeys with a virus which would  produce the fatal Newcastle disease.  Subsequently, 8,000 turkeys died.   The technician later claimed that although he had been to the farm  where the turkeys had died, he had not actually administered the virus,  but had instead pocketed the money, and that the turkeys had died from  neglect and other causes unrelated to the virus.  This may have been a  self-serving statement.  The Washington Post reported that “According to  U.S. intelligence reports, the Cubans – and some Americans – believe  the turkeys died as the result of espionage.”     
>  
>In 1971, also according to participants, the CIA turned over to Cuban  exiles a virus which causes African swine fever.  Six weeks later, an  outbreak of the disease in Cuba forced the slaughter of 500,000 pigs to  prevent a nationwide animal epidemic.  The outbreak, the first ever in  the Western hemisphere, was called the “most alarming event” of the year  by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.     
>  
>Ten years later, the target may well have been human beings, as an  epidemic of dengue fever swept the Cuban island.  Transmitted by  blood-eating insects, usually mosquitos, the disease produces severe flu  symptoms and incapacitating bone pain.  Between May and October 1981,  over 300,000 cases were reported in Cuba with 158 fatalities, 101 of  which were children under 15.      In 1956 and 1958, declassified documents have revealed, the US Army  loosed swarms of specially bred mosquitos in Georgia and Florida to see  whether disease-carrying insects could be weapons in a biological war.   The mosquitos bred for the tests were of the Aedes Aegypti type, the  precise carrier of dengue fever as well as other diseases.     In 1967 it was reported by *Science*  magazine that at the US government center in Fort Detrick, Maryland,  dengue fever was amongst those “diseases that are at least the objects  of considerable research and that appear to be among those regarded as  potential BW \[biological warfare\] agents.”  
>  
>The ingenuity which went into the chemical and biological warfare  against Cuba was apparent in some of the dozens of plans to assassinate  or humiliate Fidel Castro. Devised by the CIA or Cuban exiles, with the  cooperation of American mafiosi, the plans ranged from poisoning  Castro’s cigars and food to a chemical designed to make his hair and  beard fall off and LSD to be administered just before a public speech.  There were also of course the more traditional approaches of gun and  bomb, one being an attempt to drop bombs on a baseball stadium while  Castro was speaking; the B-26 bomber was driven away by anti-aircraft  fire before it could reach the stadium.     It is a combination of such Cuban security measures, informers,  incompetence, and luck which has served to keep the bearded one alive to  the present day.  
>  
>Attempts were also made on the lives of Castro’s brother Raul and Che  Guevara.  The latter was the target of a bazooka fired at the United  Nations building in New York in December 1964.      Various Cuban exile groups have engaged in violence on a regular  basis in the United States with relative impunity for decades.  One of  them, going by the name of Omega 7 and headquartered in Union City, New  Jersey, was characterized by the FBI in 1980 as “the most dangerous  terrorist organization in the United States”. Attacks against Cuba itself began to lessen around the end of the  1960s, due probably to a lack of satisfying results combined with ageing  warriors, and exile groups turned to targets in the United States and  elsewhere in the world.  
>  
>During the next decade, while the CIA continued to pour money into  the exile community, more than 100 serious “incidents” took place in the  United States for which Omega 7 and other groups claimed  responsibility.  (Within the community, the distinction between a  terrorist and a non-terrorist group is not especially precise; there is  much overlapping identity and frequent creation of new names.) There  occurred repeated bombings of the Soviet UN Mission, its Washington  embassy, its automobiles, a Soviet ship docked in New Jersey, the  offices of the Soviet airline Aeroflot, with a number of American  policemen and Russians injured in these attacks; several bombings of the   Cuban UN Mission and its Interests Section in Washington, many attacks  upon Cuban diplomats, including at least one murder; a bomb discovered  at New York’s Academy of Music in 1976 shortly  before a celebration of  the Cuban Revolution was to begin; a  bombing two years later of the  Lincoln Center after the Cuban ballet had performed; three bombings in a  single night in 1979:  the office of a New Jersey Cuban refugee  program, a New Jersey pharmacy that sent medical supplies to Cuba, and a  suitcase that exploded at JFK Airport, injuring four luggage handlers,  minutes before it was to be placed aboard a TWA flight to Los Angeles.     
>  
>The single most violent act of this period was the blowing up of a  Cubana Airlines plane shortly after it took off from Barbados on 6  October 1976, which took the lives of 73 people including the entire  Cuban championship fencing team.  CIA documents later revealed that on  22 June, a CIA officer abroad had cabled a report to Agency headquarters  that he had learned from a source that a Cuban exile group planned to  bomb a Cubana airliner flying between Panama and Havana.  The group’s  leader was a baby doctor named Orlando Bosch.  After the plane crashed  in the sea in October, it was Bosch’s network of exiles that claimed  responsibility.  The cable showed that the CIA had the means to  penetrate the Bosch organization, but there’s no indication in any of  the documents that the Agency undertook any special monitoring of Bosch  and his group because of their plans, or that the CIA warned Havana.     
>  
>In 1983, while Orlando Bosch sat in a Venezuelan prison charged with  masterminding the plane bombing, the City Commission of Miami proclaimed  a “Dr. Orlando Bosch Day"". In 1968, Bosch had been convicted of a bazooka attack on a Polish ship in Miami.  
>  
>Although there has always been the extreme lunatic fringe in the  Cuban exile community (as opposed to the normal lunatic fringe)  insisting that Washington has sold out their cause, over the years there  has been only the occasional arrest and conviction of an exile for a  terrorist attack in the United States, so occasional that the exiles can  only assume that Washington’s heart is not wholly in it.  The exile  groups and their key members are well known to the authorities, for the  anti-Castroites have not excessively shied away from publicity.  At  least as late as the early 1980s, they were training openly in southern  Florida and southern California; pictures of them flaunting their  weapons appeared in the press.     The CIA, with its countless contacts-cum-informers amongst the exiles,  could fill in many of the missing pieces for the FBI and the police, if  it wished to.  In 1980, in a detailed report on Cuban-exile terrorism, *The Village Voice* of New York reported:  
>  
>Two stories were squeezed out of New York police officials … “You  know, it’s funny,” said one cautiously, “there have been one or two  things … but let’s put it this way. You get just so far on a case and  suddenly the dust is blown away. Case closed. You ask the CIA to help,  and they say they aren’t really interested. You get the message.”  Another investigator said he was working on a narcotics case involving  Cuban exiles a couple of years ago, and telephone records he obtained  showed a frequently dialed number in Miami. He said he traced the number  to a company called Zodiac, “which turned out to be a CIA front.” He  dropped his investigation.     
>  
>The Cuban exiles in the United States, collectively, may well constitute the longest lasting and most prolific terrorist group in the  world.  It is thus the height of irony, not to mention hypocrisy, that  for many years up to the present time in the 1990s, the State Department  has included Cuba amongst those nations that “sponsor terrorism”, not  because of any terrorist acts committed by the Cuban government, but  solely because they “harbor terrorists”.

tl;dr the USA acted like hypocrites during the Cuban Missile Crisis, has sponsored multiple terrorist groups against Cuba, attempted an illegal invasion in 1961, blocked charity to Cuba, sunk a British ship violating the Cuban embargo and carried out a campaign of chemical and biological warfare against Cuba...

The two questions are, therefore

The signing of the Phase One trade deal and the future of China-US relations continued to be at the forefront of China’s national attention, and if a major domestic controversy existed, it was over how two women were able to drive a luxury SUV into the Forbidden Palace to snap pictures for social media. Discussions in homes and offices primarily revolved around that and each person’s plans for Spring Festival. The Year of the Rat was approaching – and as the first animal in the Chinese zodiac, it represents a new cycle and a new beginning.


Things have changed since then.

---


As of Sunday, January 26, there have been 56 fatalities directly attributable to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak^1. The number of confirmed cases worldwide stands at 2,054, but the numbers from the National Health Commission are unlikely to be indicative of the true value – due to either practical circumstances or ‘political considerations’. 

As such, it is difficult to precisely assess and confirm the scale of the outbreak from a global perspective, but there are growing signs that this is now a fully-fledged domestic crisis – a calamity that is pushing the capabilities of the Party and state. 

**If the situation continues to escalate, it is highly probable that China’s economic development will witness pronounced effects.**

The clearest gaugeable consequence will be the severe damage caused to first quarter economic growth, in turn dramatically muddling the hopes of 2020 acting as a period of recovery. China’s increasingly consumption-based economy^2 is tremendously dependent on Chinese New Year for meeting targets and expectations^3, and for many industries, the outbreak brings unwelcome pain after an already tumultuous year. 

The film industry, as an example, saw uncertainty swell up in 2019, and as such, 2020’s spring releases were not just a chance to reap greater revenue – they were critical to the continuation of any forward momentum^4. Many premieres have been postponed or cancelled, and nearly every theater has been shut down^5. Even if they were not, it would have been unlikely for them to receive any sizeable audience.

This is a story that many businesses and industries will face, in turn inflicting larger shockwaves at a critical juncture where the economy is seeking to transform into a services and consumption-based model of growth^6. While this transformation can be expected to continue and fully mature, economic lethargy in 2020 will slow this process down. In some respects, this also applies to other macroeconomic trends. 

China’s long-term growth should largely remain the same, but if 2020 truly proves to be weaker amidst a dismal start, certain projections and benchmarks could be pushed back by at least a year. A whole array of preexisting calculations would then have to be adjusted, none of which would be beneficial for the Party.

Even in the ongoing whirlwind of outbreak response efforts, the central leadership must know that longer-term ramifications – far-reaching in breadth and severity – will have to be taken into account. On top of preexisting external pressures, it is becoming clear that guiding the country through this new zodiac cycle will be even more difficult than expected.
