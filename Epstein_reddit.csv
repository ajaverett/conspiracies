9,I am combing through all the Epstein files. You asked for it. Here it is. PART 2 - The next 300+ page breakdown.,15921.0,cr4tvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cr4tvy/i_am_combing_through_all_the_epstein_files_you/,815.0,1565953465.0,"Well, I didn’t get much sleep and [posting this goes against the recommendation of my doctor](https://nypost.com/2019/08/15/jeffrey-epsteins-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-spotted-at-in-n-out-burger-in-first-photos-since-his-death/ “Epstein Gal pal found at IN-N-OUT reading book on Deaths of CIA Operatives”), but I finished it and just in time for Friday morning.

First, I would just like to say thank you to everyone who upvoted, shared this and gave me an award. You guys really motivated me to keep reading this stuff and broke my reddit with all the messages. Last night we reached 17th on the front page. I almost died when I saw that (not by two shots to the back of the head either just shock). So many people must have seen it and that is my biggest hope for this work. The more eyes the better. 

Second, for all of you asking, no I do not intend to kill myself by shooting myself in the back of the head twice, [strangling myself in a way more common with murder then suicide](https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php?utm_campaign=CMS%20Sharing%20Tools%20(Desktop)&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral “Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said”) , or any other way to be clear? I am a little exhausted, grossed out, stopped following a few people, broke my reddit, but not my neck thankfully in a mysterious fall, but other then that I am great.

Third, there is one section of pages, 34-90, exhibit E through K, that you might want to skip over, if you are trying to save time. I feel this section is important because it shows the lengths Maxwell would go try to discredit Giuffre, even though in the first dump it appears the lawyers for Giuffre argued that very little of this was used in the defenses case in their motion to dismiss, and what is going on in the underlining proceedings involved in with the documents. Lawyers will probably enjoy this the most and go read those sources directly, otherwise you can skip that content if you want. Personally, I would still read it. There are some names you might want.

Since many of you also keep asking, yes you can share this content. Do what ever you want with it. Copy and paste, save it, put it on your own blogs, use it for your own research, make a video out of it, make fun of it. Anything is approved. [Censorship is a issue we all have to help to overcome](https://youtu.be/wSTHgoaVtSw). The only thing I ask is if you share it please try to link back the original reddit page so people can upvote it. I don’t mind if you are looking for karma or views but the more upvotes on a single post the more we get boosted to the front page and the more eyes that will see it. If you do not want to lose it, you can bookmark it by clicking the little flag on the top right.

Finally, here are a few things to look out for:

-	Names of lawyers, associates to Epstein. 
-	Claims about Prince Andrews shady deals and friends. 
-	What the newspapers wrote at the time.
-	How Giuffre got the job at Mar-a-Lago.
-	Testimony from Fiancé at time, father and others 
Overall this dump is less salacious then the first, but I feel just as important, especially for trying to answer certain questions you guys were asking in the first post.

-	Failed to join under rule 15 because undue delay joining, undue prejudice that amendment will cause. 

Page 35-36

allegations made against him and requesting a show cause order to the attorney that have made them”. Court

P., which provides “a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all discrete subparts” – in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories in this case, including subparts, in violation of Rule 33

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege

(Missing pages)

Page 72

-	A request that each of these attorneys list all communications with the media is facially overbroad

-	Ms. Giuffre objects to this Interrogatory because a response would cause Ms. Giuffre the incredible and undue burden of having to catalogue literally hundreds of communications that she has already produced in this case.

-	Giuffre objects because this interrogatory calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence

-	Giuffre objects to the extent that this interrogatory seeks the communications of her attorneys, any author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer, commentator, investigative journalist, photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter, stringer, or any other employee of any media organization or independent consultant

-	Ms. Giuffre is not obligated to produce anything currently in the possession of Defendant Maxwell or her attorneys.

Page 87

-	Needed to do was issue an immediate denial and that necessarily had to be short and to the point 

-	Claimed they were “obvious lies”

-	Barden goes after Giuffre credibility for not stating certain claims sooner or claiming that they have changed 

-	For example – “Yet in her joinder motion she claimed she did have sex with Prince Andrew and that the sex 
occurred in what can only be described as a very small bathtub, too small for a man of Prince Andrew’s size to 
enjoy a bath in let alone sex”

Page 88

-	Barden did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely to disseminate 
information to the media

-	purpose in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated to those media representatives was twofold. 

-	First, wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation

-	Second, intended statement to be “a shot across the bow” of the media, which I believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff’s allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own

-	intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients
Page 90

-	Continues to try to attack Giuffre’s credibility

-	Brings up Alan Dershowitz

-	Barden claims it was his opinion Giuffre was lying

-	Q) Do you remember there being a job posting that you felt like was appropriate for Virginia or did you just go out and talk to the woman who ran the spa area on your own? 

-	A) I just talked to Angela. 

-	Q) Okay. Do you recall whether this was intended to be a full-time job? 

-	A) I don't remember if it was full time or just summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida. 

-	Q) What would you call the season, the seasonal aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? 

-	A) Probably from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess. 

-	Q) Is that the coolest time? 

-	A) Times of the year, yes. 

-	Q) And it's more guests that come during that period of time? 

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) And is there more staff brought on during that period of time?

Page 224

-	A) Yes. 

-	Q) You saw that happen every year that you were there? 

-	A) Every year. 

-	Q) And in the summer, it's relatively dead because it's so hot? 

-	A) Basically, it closed during the summer. That's when we would kind of work on everything and then make sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you know. 

-	Q) Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired to work in, what her job title was, for example? 

-	A) I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia. That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was busy all the time. 

-	Q) I understand. 

-	A) I didn't have time to go see what she was doing. I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do. I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the name that sticks out. 

(Missing pages)

Page 225

-	A Where did I learn that? 

-	Q) Uh-huh. 

-	A) I think Virginia had told me that there was a lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her. I couldn't tell you what she looked like. But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever, you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy. 

-	Q) When did Virginia tell you this? 

-	A) Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I don't remember.

-	Q I understand. Did she tell you this while she was working at Mar-a-Lago? 

-	A) Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she could possibly get this other job

Page 226

-	Q) Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein? 

-	A) Once. 

-	Q) When was that? 

-	A) I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I mean, you can't tell people by looking at them. I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you know.

-	Q) Was it about the same time Virginia started working with him? 

-	A) Yeah. 

-	Q) Was it later? 

-	A) I think it was about the time she started. Because I wanted to see where she was at, you know. And it was just a mansion down the street from, you know, Mar-a-Lago. So I didn't think twice about it. I didn't think nothing of it. He came out. He was very cordial, very nice.

Page 228

-	Q) Okay. Have you ever met Ms. Maxwell? 

-	A) Not that I remember ever meeting her.

Initially, I found it to be a community of rational individuals who wanted to question the status quo. During the height of the Epstein case last year it was pleasing to see users accept that NONE of our politicians are innocent and essentially on the same team. 

However, I've noticed over the summer that posts on r/conspiracy have become overwhelmingly right leaning. Half the time there's no real conspiracy being discussed! As I'm typing this, this sub has become nothing more than a right wing political page.  

What;s even worse is that I've noticed a flood of pro QAnon posts. For years Qanon has been ridiculed by serious conspiracy theorists based on how wrong it has been about virtually every event. The fact that anyone would believe that Trump, a man who's been a billionaire since his birth, is somehow attempting to expose the corruption of the elite is mind boggling to me.

My advice to any like minded individuals would be to leave this sub ASAP. I fully believe things will only get worse from here.",conspiracy,Epstein

User https://old.reddit.com/user/anutensil/  is the moderator of most subs Maxwell is moderator of.

Most posts are submits very similar to Maxwell.  Might be a sockpuppet.  Might be an acquaintance or employee.

Focused on subreddits Health, Democrats and more (moderator in a bunch of groups including these).  Focused topics: A bunch of corona articles targeted to bash Trump.

My opinion: This is an sockpuppet account by Maxwell to flood her ideology into more subreddits and have more power when her moderator role is questioned.  We should extend our investigations towards that account as well.

Page 195

\- DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 11. One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre “named” repeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms. Maxwell. According to the “lurid details” of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a “sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme” created by Epstein: § Ms. Maxwell “approached” Ms. Giuffre in 1999 when Ms. Giuffre was “fifteen years old” to recruit her into the scheme. § Ms. Maxwell was “one of the main women” Epstein used to “procure under-aged girls for sexual activities.” § Ms. Maxwell was a “primary co-conspirator” with Epstein in his scheme. Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page6 of 66 7 § She “persuaded” Ms. Giuffre to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other children.” § At the mansion, when Ms. Giuffre began giving Epstein a massage, he and Ms. Maxwell “turned it into a sexual encounter.” § Epstein “with the assistance of” Ms. Maxwell “converted \[Ms. Giuffre\] into . . . a ‘sex slave.’” Id. Ms. Giuffre was a “sex slave” from “about 1999 through 2002.” § Ms. Maxwell also was a “co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse.” § Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes she committed in Florida.” § Ms. Maxwell “participat\[ed\] in the sexual abuse of \[Ms. Giuffre\] and others.” § Ms. Maxwell “took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including \[Ms. Giuffre\].” Id. She shared the photos with Epstein. § As part of her “role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring,” Ms. Maxwell “connect\[ed\]” Epstein with “powerful individuals” so that Epstein could traffic Ms. Giuffre to these persons. § Ms. Giuffre was “forced to have sexual relations” with Prince Andrew in § “\[Ms. Maxwell’s\] apartment” in London. Ms. Maxwell “facilitated” Ms. Giuffre’s § sex with Prince Andrew “by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein.” § Ms. Maxwell “assist\[ed\] in internationally trafficking” Ms. Giuffre and “numerous other young girls for sexual purposes.” § Ms. Giuffre was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.”

\- Picture of Maxwell, prince Andrew drew and Giuffre.

\- Ms Giuffre travel records are incomplete, many examples. She was being flown by them without keeping records some of the time

Page 243

\- Detective Recarey knew that Maxwell was involved in the illegal sexual activities at Epstein's house. He wanted to speak to her, but Maxwell did not return his calls. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 28:23-29:10.

\- A walk through video taken during the execution of the search warrant revealed photos of topless females at the home, and there was even a photograph of Maxwell naked hanging in the home. The house staff who were deposed in the civil cases each testified to Maxwell being the boss in charge of everyone in the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 1, Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page55 of 66 56 19, 21, Banasiak Dep. Tr. at 8:21-9:16; 14:20-15:6; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 23:11-23:20; Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 169:1-169:4.

Page 244

\- Rodriguez, the house butler from 2004 through 2005, a time period that revealed daily sexual abuse of underage females, testified that Maxwell kept a list of the local girls who were giving massages at her desk, and that Maxwell kept nude photos of girls on her computer. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 238:4-238:22; 302:19-303:10; 306:1- 306:24.

\- Recarey testified that when the search warrant was executed, the house had been sanitized and the computers removed from the home. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 72:25-73:15.

\- Banaziak testified that the computers were removed by Adriana Ross, another employee who answered to Maxwell. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 19, Banaziak Dep. Tr. at 54:7-22.

Page 245

\- Tony Figueroa, Ms. Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, did testify that Maxwell personally requested that he find and bring girls to Epstein for sex once Ms. Giuffre had escaped, and that when he brought the girls Maxwell interacted with them. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 200:6-18; 228:23-229:21.

\- Rodriguez testified unequivocally that Maxwell was ""the boss"" and that she knew everything that was going on. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 169:1-169:4.

\- Nude photographs were displayed throughout Epstein’s home. Furthermore, Alfredo Rodriguez testified to Maxwell having pornography on her computer. Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24.

\- He also testified to there being a collage of nude photos in Epstein's closet. Id. 253:14-254:18. That collage was eventually taken into evidence by Detective Recarey, who testified to that fact in his deposition. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24.

\- **And those photos are still in the possession of the FBI or US Attorney's Office. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 74:2-74:7.**

\- Ronaldo Rizzo, who visited the home on numerous occasions and who was reprimanded by Maxwell herself for looking at the nude photos. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 14, Rizzo Dep. Tr. at 25:19-26:20.

Page 246

\- Johanna Sjorberg testified that the Defendant bought her a camera for the specific purpose of her taking nude photos of herself. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16 Sjoberg Tr. at 150.

\- Virginia Giuffre testified that there was a nude photograph of her at the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5 Virginia Giuffre Tr. at 232 and 333.

Page 264

\- Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for Epstein, and punished her when she didn’t cause Epstein to orgasm.

\- Tony Figueroa testified that Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for Epstein, and also testified that Maxwell and Epstein participated in multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre.

\- the butler for Defendant’s close friend witnessed, first-hand, a fifteen-year-old Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with Epstein and she refused.

\- Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sextrafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls” defense.

Page 265

\- Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that Defendant shared with Ms. Giuffre – although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even a single one of those flights.

\- Defendant’s heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring and in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms. Giuffre was a minor, and traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein – including 23 documented flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre were regularly together.

Page 266

\- The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a household with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While there, she actively took part in recruiting underage girls and young women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers.

\- Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a minor when Defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Thereafter, Ms. Giuffre flew on Epstein’s private jets – the – Lolita Express” – with Defendant at least 23 times.

\- Ms. Sjoberg’s account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly similar. As with Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg’s school grounds. She lured Ms. Sjoberg into her and Epstein’s home under the guise of a legitimate job of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college student, Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page12 of 74 5 nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to massage Epstein, and made it clear that Sjoberg’s purpose was to bring Epstein to orgasm during these massages so that Defendant did not have to do it.

Page 268

\- Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion.

\- **Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre’s breast while using a hand to touch Ms. Sjoberg’s breast.**

\- Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms. Giuffre had with Defendant and Epstein which included the use of strap-ons.

Page 269

\- Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had found any other girls for Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls for Epstein:

Page 270

\- Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears – how, while working at Dubin’s house, he observed Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin’s house. In distress, the 15 year old girl tearfully explained to him that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through threats and stealing her passport.

Page 271

\- Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre’s mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre started living with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre’s “new momma.” 10 Incredulously, Defendant testified that she barely remembered Ms. Giuffre.

\- Detective Recarey led the Palm Beach Police’s investigation of Epstein. He testified that Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her in relation to his investigation, but could not contact her due to the interference of Epstein’s lawyer.

Page 272

\- Notably, at Defendant’s deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms. Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein’s pilot’s flight logs.13

\- However, David Rodgers, Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials – GM – was, in fact, Ghislaine Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which Defendant flew with Plaintiff. 14 The dates of those flights show that Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on many of them when she flew with Defendant.

\- Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years. They both invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s participation in recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein.

Page 273

\- Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him.

Page 274

\- Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one – to testify that Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or participate in the sex.

\- Even one of her own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex.

\- Another one of Defendant’s witnesses, Ms. Giuffre’s mother, named Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s “new mamma.” Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time with her in Epstein’s shared household, like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have testified that she was Epstein’s procuress.

\- Others who lived with her – Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia Marcinkova, and Sarah Kellen – invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions on the same. No one has testified to the contrary.

\- **Defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and why she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a child, including 6 international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile’s private jet all over the world.**

Page 275

\- Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre’s photographs of her, Defendant, and Epstein.

\- She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was photographed with his hand around Ms. Giuffre’s bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with Defendant, inside Defendant’s house in London.

\- This photograph corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted sex offender.

\- Ms. Giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and Epstein.

Page 276

\- Ms. Giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the Zorro Ranch, Epstein’s New Mexico Ranch.

\- Among other nude photos, which included full nudes of Defendant, Ms. Giuffre produced images of females that the Palm Beach Police confiscated during the execution of the 22 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 42, GIUFFRE007175; 007173. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page22 of 74 15 warrant, including one photograph revealing the bare bottom of a girl who appears to be prepubescent.

Page 277

\- In 2008, the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida identified Ms. Giuffre as a protected “victim” of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex abuse. The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms. Giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.

\- Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case, including medical records from the time when Defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both 23 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 44, GIUFFRE007584. 24 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 30, GIUFFRE 002216-002218, Victim Notification Letter.

The dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old.

Page 278

\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice

\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice.

\- Ms. Giuffre sought counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by Defendant and Epstein. A 2011 psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist, unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s abuser.

Page 279

\- Years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her treating psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein.

\- Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into Epstein and his associates’ sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of hand-written messages taken by various staff, including Defendant, at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence.

\- The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell’s involvement in the sexual abuse of minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell’s denial of any involvement with Epstein during relevant time periods, and, accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events.

Page 280

\- Messages reveals that Maxwell, “GM,” took messages at the residence, including from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein.

Page 282

\- One message pad reflects , who is identified in the Palm Beach Police Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for “work” explaining that she does not have any money. The term “work” was often used by members of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages.

\- Giuffre 001462: July 5th no year to JE from ”I need work. I mean I don’t have money. Do you have some work for me?”

\- Other message pads reflect who was a minor, calling and leaving a message at the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for Jeffrey Epstein. The second message demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein required different girls to be scheduled every day of the week. The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the home at the same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate the lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at least raises a question of fact whether Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as Giuffre has said, or whether Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or aware of this activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe

\- Giuffre 001428 – undated Jeffrey From – “Has girl for tonight” ;Giuffre 001432 (pictured above)– 7/9/04 – Mr. Epstein From – “ is available on Tuesday no one for tomorrow”; GIUFFRE 001433 /1/17/04 – Mr. Epstein from – “Me and \_\_\_\_\_ can come tomorrow any time or alone” ; Giuffre – 001452 – undated Jeffrey from “Has girl for tonight.”

\- Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis.

\- Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)– JE from “N” – “ hasn’t confirmed for 11:00 yet, so she is keeping on hold in case doesn’t call back; Giuffre 001448 -8/20/05 JE from - confirmed \_\_\_ at 4 pm. Who is scheduled for morning? I believe wants to work.”

\- This message pad reflects that a friend of Jeffrey Epstein is sending him a sixteen year old Russian girl for purposes of sex.

\- Giuffre 001563 (pictured above)- 6/1/05 For Jeffrey From Jean Luc “He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 1st today if you call.”

Page 283

\- This message pad directly refutes Maxwell’s sworn testimony that she was not present during the year 2005 at Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion because this shows leaving a message for Jeffrey at the Palm Beach home that she was going to work out 30 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 28. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page28 of 74 21 with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only able to retrieve a fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered, it shows Maxwell was regularly at the Palm Beach home during the time period she claimed she was not. To the contrary, she was both sending and receiving messages and messages, like this one, reflect her presence at the mansion.

\- Giuffre 001412 – 9/10/05 (during the year Maxwell says she was never around) JE from – “I went to Sarah and made her water bottle and I went to work out with GM.”

\- These message pads further corroborate that Defendant lied in her testimony and she was in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the years 2004 and 2005. For example, the message from “Larry” demonstrates that Defendant is at the Palm Beach mansion so frequently that people, including Epstein’s main pilot Larry Visoski, are leaving messages for Maxwell at the Palm Beach house.

\- Giuffre 001435 7/25/04 – Mr. Epstein from Ms. Maxwell – “tell him to call me”; Giuffre – 001449 – 8/22/05 – JE from GM; Giuffre – 001453 – 4/25/04 for Ms. Maxwell From Larry “returning your call”;

\- This message pad shows that Defendant was clearly actively involved in Jeffrey Epstein’s life and the activities at his Palm Beach mansion.

\- Giuffre – 001454 – undated Jeffrey From Ghislaine – “Would be helpful to have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ come to Palm Beach today to stay here and help train new staff with Ghislaine.”

\- This message pad clearly reflects an underage female (noted by the police redaction of the name) leaving a message asking if she can come to the house at a later time because she needs to “stay in school.”

\- ” Giuffre 001417 (pictured above)– Jeffrey 2/28/05 Redacted name “She is wondering if 2:30 is o.k. She needs to stay in school.”

\- This message pad reflects a message from who was under the age of eighteen at the time she was going over to Jeffrey Epstein’s home to provide sexual massages according to the Palm Beach Investigative Report.

\- Giuffre 001421 3/4/05 to Jeffrey from “It is o.k. for to stop by and drop something?”

\- These message pads reflect the pattern of underage girls (noted by the police redaction of the name on the message pad) calling the Palm Beach mansion to leave a message about sending a “female” over to provide a sexual massage.

\- Giuffre 001423 11/08/04 To Mr. JE – redacted from – “I have a female for him”Giuffre 001426 (pictured above) – 1/09/05 JE To JE from Redacted – “I have a female for him.”

Page 284

\- This message pad reflects the pattern and practice of having young girls bring other young girls to the house to perform sexual massages. Indeed the “ ” reflected in this message pad corresponds in name to the ” that Tony Figueroa testified he initially brought to Jeffrey Epstein during the time period that the Defendant was requesting that Tony find some young females to bring to Jeffrey Epstein’s home. See Figueroa at 184- 185. The Palm Beach Police Report reflects that “ ” and “ ” also brought seventeen year old to the home to perform sexual massages. See GIUFFRE 05641. thereafter recruited a number of other young girls to perform sexual Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page29 of 74 22 massages as reflected in the Palm Beach Police Report.

\- Giuffre 001427 (pictured above) – 1/2/03 – JE from “Wants to know if she should bring her friend with tonight.”

\- This message pad reflects multiple sexual massages being scheduled for the same day which corroborates Virginia GIUFFRE, and Johanna Sjorberg’s testimony that Jeffrey Epstein required that he have multiple orgasms in a day which occurred during these sexual massages.

\- Giuffre 001449 (pictured above) – 9/03/05 JE from – “I left message for to confirm for 11:00 a.m. and for 4:30 p.m.”

\- This message pad shows a friend of Jeffrey Epstein’s discussing with him how he had sex with an 18 year old who had also been with Jeffrey Epstein.

\- Giuffre – 001456 (pictured above)– undated JE from Jean Luc – “He just did a good one – 18 years – she spoke to me and said “I love Jeffrey.”

\- Law enforcement was able to confirm identities of underage victims through the use of the names and telephone numbers in these message pads

Page 285

**The Black Book**

\- Palm Beach Police confiscated an extensive lists of contacts with their phone numbers form Defendant and Epstein’s residence.32 Ghislaine Maxwell maintained a contact list in an 31 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 42:14-43:17; 78:25:-79:15. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page30 of 74 23 approximately 100-page-long hard copy, which was openly available to other house employees.

\- It consisted primarily of telephone numbers, addresses, or email addresses for various personal friends, associates, employees, or personal or business connections of Epstein or Defendant. Prior to being terminated by Defendant, the Palm Beach house butler Alfredo Rodriguez printed a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the FBI.

\- This document reflects the numerous phone numbers of Defendant, Epstein as well as staff phone numbers.

\- Additionally, and importantly, there are several sections entitled “Massage” alongside a geographical designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers. These numbers included those of underage females (with no training in massage therapy ) – including – identified during the criminal investigation of Epstein. This document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with Epstein, Defendant, and the management of their properties, and the knowledge each had of the contents of the document.

**Sex Slave Amazon.com Book Receipt**

\- Detective Recarey authenticated an Amazon.com receipt that the Palm Beach Police collected from Jeffrey Epstein’s trash.

\- The books he ordered are titled:

(1) SM 101: A Realistic Introduction, Wiseman, Jay;

(2) SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude – Principles, Skills and Tools by Guy Baldwin; and (3) Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners, by Christina Abernathy, as shown below: 32 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 45, Phone List, Public Records Request No.: 16-268 at 2282 – 2288. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page31 of 74 24

\- This disturbing 2005 purchase corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s account of being sexually exploited by Defendant and Epstein – not to mention the dozens of underage girls in the Palm Beach Police Report. Additionally, Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and 2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however, record evidence contradicts that testimony.

Page 287

**Thailand Folder with Defendant’s Phone Number**

\- Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to Thailand. While Epstein had paid for a massage therapy session in Thailand, there was a catch.

\- Defendant told Virginia she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and Defendant.

\- On the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant wrote on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet, and she was also instructed to check in frequently with Defendant as it was further signified by the words “Call Ms. Maxwell (917) !” on Virginia’s travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the hard copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein.

\- The FBI report and the Churcher emails reference Ms. Giuffre’s accounts of sexual activity with Prince Andrew that she made in 2011, contrary to Defendant’s argument that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until 2014.",conspiracy,Epstein

Maxwellhill was a very active reddit user who produced highly upvoted posts but there has been no posting at all since Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested. 

**Evidence:**

- Posts nearly every day for 14 years up until Ghislaine Maxwell's arrest.

- Gaps in posting line up with [Maxwell's mother's death](https://i.postimg.cc/3rv39MK0/1594251098015.png) *and* the [Kleiner Perkins party](https://i.imgur.com/VCzoTeK.jpg) where former Reddit CEO Ellen K.

- ""Maxwellhill"" may be a combination of her surname and the family estate in the UK, [Headington Hill Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headington_Hill_Hall) 

- Account spams strictly liberal propaganda, but doesn't seem to have mentioned anything Epstein related.

- User is not some other person from Malaysia as r/worldnews mods have said [here](https://i.postimg.cc/bYm5cHQh/nylaw-mod-worldnews.png) and [here](https://i.postimg.cc/HnN3Jz28/twitter-maxwell-malaysia.png)

  - [Maxwellhill AMA strongly suggests user is British](https://np.reddit.com/r/redditoroftheday/comments/bdl3o/maxwellhill_redditor_of_the_day_march_15_2010/) by the terminology she uses.  For instance, their favorite word is ""Bollocks"" and the use of English colloquialisms.  That the user claims to be male is likely an attempt to remain anonymous, which is not surprising, since she was a sex trafficker and child groomer for Epstein.  The user never revealed her true identity in any interview or post, but left clues.

User was accused of corruption, auto-deleting mentions of their own account and more. Article: [Meet the Reddit power user who helped bring down r/technology](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/reddit-maxwellhill-moderator-technology-flaw/)

The article also implies that Maxwellhill worked closely with Reddit co-founders Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman to help seed content and popularize the site. This was Maxwellhill's job. And Huffman and Ohanian [created hundreds of fake accounts](https://archive.md/TGT8M)  to help seed and spread content. Senior moderators on important subs can help shape the narrative - especially on news items. Given Ghislaine Maxwell's connections to Israeli intelligence, if Maxwellhill is in fact Ghislaine Maxwell, it's a pretty bold and overt play by an intelligence agency to manipulate a platform like Reddit.

42,Megathread: Ghislaine Maxwell (Epstein) documents unsealed. Important excerpts will be added here.,6618.0,i0zppc,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/i0zppc/megathread_ghislaine_maxwell_epstein_documents/,1324.0,1596163513.0,"***This post will be updated regularly as more is uncovered.  Dark to Light!***

In September 2015 Virginia Roberts Giuffre (VRG) sued Ghislaine Maxwell for defamation in New York federal court.  The documents unsealed today by Judge Preska are those that were filed under seal in that case in 2015.

There is overlap with older released documents, so some of this may not be new.  More will be released Monday.

(Edit: Two Clinton judges on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals [delayed release of the 2016 deposition] (https://www.newsweek.com/ghislaine-maxwell-deposition-release-delayed-appeals-court-1522099) until September 22.)

[**The source documents are here.**](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355835/giuffre-v-maxwell/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc)  The link may be down at times.

I am finding that all of the so called compilation PDFs, ZIPs, and dumps are incomplete or parts of the old Epstein docs of 2019.  [Exhibit 15 always seems to be missing, which implicates Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7010927/Virginia-Giuffre-Interview-2011.pdf) Only go to the source for the complete unsealed documents.  

[**These are the older Epstein files released in 2019, a 2,024 page PDF**](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6250471-Epstein-Docs.html).

There is some confusion about what documents are old and what is newly unsealed, which may be deliberate attempts to muddy the waters.

47,2 years of compiled research available as PDF download or video format proves Pizzagate is 100% real. I have enough evidence for law enforcement in America to open up a real investigation.,6234.0,hn7crw,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hn7crw/2_years_of_compiled_research_available_as_pdf/,1113.0,1594170479.0,"**EDIT: I don't have time to reply to everyone right now, but I will be leaving a detailed reply very soon. I will link in the comments. All you shills have zero effect on me. Keep drinking your cognitive dissonance cocktails.**

**Website:** [**www.seanspeaks.co.uk**](https://www.seanspeaks.co.uk) 

Hello people of the world. My names Sean. I am in investigative journalist who has covered Pizzagate extensively for the past 4 years. For anyone new to this subject, **pizzagate is about the potential trafficking and killing of innocent children in Satanic Rituals.** Its crazy how John Podestas leaked emails lead to this dark, satanic, pedo underworld where they do all this horrible stuff to kids. This scandal broke in November 2016 right before the presidential election. Since that day a massive disinformation campaign has been initiated to shut down all discussions of Pizzagate online. The Government and controlled Zionist mainstream media have done a fantastic job at completely discrediting the story without acknowledging any of the facts.

I have created this content in a easy, informative manner, to take the viewer on the same journey I did. **Caution: If you go down this rabbit hole it will completely change your perspective on life and the world around you.** Once you fully come to terms with what Pizzagate is actually about, it turns your stomach sick and compels you to do something about it.

Pizzagate is a giant jigsaw puzzle. When looking into this subject you need to treat it as if you were a detective investigating a crime. You would look at all the evidence to determine if the people implicated are involved in criminal activity or not. Pizzagate is an accumulation of circumstantial evidence which leads to one logical conclusion. **Serious corruption at the highest echelons of Government involving the potential trafficking and killing of innocent children.** The state will do anything, and everything in their power to stop this story from being fully understood by the public.

The evidence I have put together for you proves, without a shadow of a doubt, Pizzagate is real. It proves, without a shadow of a doubt, that law enforcement in the US must open up an investigation into Pizzgate immediately. **To be clear, that is what we need. A real investigation for trained professionals within the law.** This is not something people like me or you should be doing online. I have created my work this way so no one can argue and call it ***""fake news""***, or a ***""conspiracy theory"".*** My content is truthful, factual, and legitimate. End of story.

Once you fully understand the severity of this scandal. What you do about it is down to you. If you want to take a stand and fight back, for the sake of all the innocent children, then share this document far and wide. Share my videos on as any social media platforms as possible. Send my documents into law enforcement in you really want to. Call politicians, do something. We cannot sit back and allow this to go on any longer. If theres one thing we can all agree on, regardless our political or religious beliefs, of even the colours of our skin, **ITS THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN.**

Please help me wake as many people up as possible to the dark, sinister truth, which is Pizzagate. My presentation is part or the larger compendium which is called **#FREEDOMGATE.**  Freedomgate is my creation. Its a movement that all people of the world can get involved with for free. Freedomgate is about liberation, revolution, and freedom, for the entire human race. Full details can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gcxioi/freedomgate\_the\_revolution\_of\_the\_human\_race\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/gcxioi/freedomgate_the_revolution_of_the_human_race_is/)

Please view my work in your own time. I just want to say that I love every single one of you who are out there fighting the good fight. We all just need to stick together, ride the wave, and see where it takes us. Thank you for reading. I appreciate you being here.

66,The pedophile control system deliberately selects pedophiles and lifts them into positions of power so that they can be controlled via blackmail. This process has been happening for a long time and all main global power structures have become saturated with pedophiles.,4469.0,euoffo,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/euoffo/the_pedophile_control_system_deliberately_selects/,492.0,1580134504.0,"With help from intelligence agencies from the CIA, FBI and Military Intelligence, all of which are full of pedophiles, this occult control system has created a complete matrix of power and thought control.

This isn't mindless conspiracy rambling but backed by many, many case studies and brave witnesses.

First the Dutroux Affair, where an elite pedophile ring was uncovered but then immediately recovered up by police and judges.

Next is the Franklin Scandal, which uncovered a child trafficking ring with ties to the white house.

A major key to the puzzle is the Greenbaum Speech by Dr. Corydon Hammond where he revealed the occult mind control programming he was finding in his patients. He found that most of his patients with Dissociative Identity Disorder were victims of ritual programming under extreme sexual abuse.

He was anti- mandate, and pro *choice on vaccines. 

He refused a salary as president, and remains one of the only presidents to LOSE in overall net worth during his presidency.

First president in 40 years to NOT enter us into a conflict (even though it's a sure-fire second-term win.) 

He brokered PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. MORE THAN ONCE, and he was nominated for the Nobel peace prize for it ffs. 

The economy was booming before covid, with the highest unemployment rate for Black Americans EVER RECORDED. 

He capped the profit margins on drug companies for things like insulin, donated more to Black Universities than any other president. Thanks Obama. 

Obama wanna go toe to toe with Trump on how many bombings in the 1st 4 years? It's ridiculous. Did Obama really ever do anything to better anyone's situation? Wtf Obama. 

Epstein and Ghizzy only got caught after 20 years of being on the FBIs radar, only for shit to start stalling again once he was out. 

The media never let up on him. 10× worse than they ever did W, and W was considered the worst president in history during his presidency too!

70,I’ve been wanting to throw a couple points out in the open about Epstein “killing himself” do with the knowledge what you will. From a former CO.,4360.0,lyputa,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lyputa/ive_been_wanting_to_throw_a_couple_points_out_in/,654.0,1614990478.0,"I worked as a Correctional Officer for roughly five years in a prison that will remain nameless but I’m more than confident most of you have heard of it. 

In my time I served in various roles from being the mail bitch to stacking up on doors for a cell extraction. I can assure you that prison is a complete different planet from the one we live on in almost every sense of the word. 

However, prison is also a place where mistakes really can’t be made. Things such as count, suicide watch, medical etc. Don’t get me wrong we can hardly even give the inmates a second pair of underwear but those previous things mentioned are damn near zero tolerance. 

Which brings me into suicide watch. I can sit here and honestly tell each and everyone of you that NO ONE and I mean NO ONE commits suicide on that watch. (I obviously don’t mean literally as a 100% success but hopefully you understand my sentiment) 

The sole reason isn’t that CO’s care and want to do the right, prosperous thing, it’s liability. It doesn’t matter if it’s Joe pedophile nobody, who raped a 5 year old and no one even knows he exists. If he manages to commit suicide on that watch every officer INCLUDING the watch first line supervisor is fired. Family wins a million dollar lawsuit from the state and its just a shit show for months. 

Now, factor a high priority individual like Epstein. I served on the CERT Team which is basically swat for corrections. (Believe me it’s not that cool lol) and I can tell you that we would have had at least (3) cameras, (2) officers, (1) sergeant and hell, maybe some asshole on a K-9 unit who wanted OT on duty 24/7 until transport was handed off. 

The watch cells are basically plexiglas for maximum observation. Not only that but the use of force justification is basically a green light, do what you have to so the inmate cannot commit the act. 

This is something that’s ate at me since the day I seen the news article that the scumbag magically killed himself. I just wanted to reaffirm that there is absolutely no way the official story is true. Like I said I just wanted to share this insight with this community, do with it what you will.",conspiracy,Epstein

You joked about us. You called us *nutcases.* You called us ""tinfoil-hatters"". You downvoted us on sites like Reddit and in other comments sections. You cheered in glee as moderators removed our comments. And yet now, after the Epstein case, most of you are beginning your comments with ""I'm not a Conspiracy Theorist but..."". Oh how the turn tables have...naah, I'll skip the meme for a change.  

Let me educate you about a pattern that we've all observed. First - they call it a conspiracy theory. Then - once the truth starts trickling out, they say, ""Oh c'mon! This was never really a conspiracy theory. Everyone with a brain knew that.""  

There was a time when nobody believed that the US was doing extremely inhuman things to people as part of their defense experiments. It was just us ""tinfoil hatters."" Then, it all turned out to be true. Then everyone was like, ""Meh. Everyone knew about it."" Then the same thing happened when us ""nutters"" warned people that they were being electronically spied on. Again, the story repeated. Then we warned the world about Elite Paedophiles and their horrifying Satanic Ritual Sacrifices. The former is now front page news. The latter will eventually follow. It has to. There is no going back past this point in our spiritual evolution.  

Many of you still don't believe the truth about 9/11. ""Jet fuel does not break steel memes"", ""7/11 was an inside job"", ha ha ha. You still refuse to see how the media makes a fool out of anyone calling out 9/11 BS. Just like many of you haven't noticed as to how quickly the majority of media sources put out the Jeffrey Epstein ""killed himself"" headline. Similarly, you probably still haven't noticed as to how the r/911truth subreddit got mercilessly quarantined by Reddit - with a lot of cheers coming their way for that. The exact same Reddit, which is also combing interesting comments calling out the Epstein ""suicide"" BS across r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, and like a shit ton of other places. But soon, I assure you all, I'll hear you say, ""Oh c'mon! Everyone has been saying Bush did 9/11 since like forever.""  

So there's the facts. I know that you are going to continue making fun of us ""tinfoil hatters"" or whatever or say that we are only forwarding some specific political party's agenda (I'll be honest here - there are many on this sub who do have such agendas. But NOT ALL of them are like that.) You are also going to cheer out loud if/as/when Reddit blocks us for having a (planted) hate post or comment or literally anything else in the future - in much the same manner as violent folks get ""planted"" to discredit peaceful protests, which are then quashed violently by the cops in ""retaliation"". You are also going to laugh as your rights get taken away and eventually, your dignity and safety and everything else you hold dear. So here are a few more things for you to know of right away - so that the next time you claim that ""everyone knew it perfectly well all along"" - at least we ""*retarded tinfoil hatters""* can *buy that shit.*  

1. ALL of your media is controlled. ALL news is planted. ALL headlines are perfectly chosen to brainwash you in a specific way. So, the next time you ""debunk"" something by giving out a ""source"" i.e. a ""trustworthy news link"" - you are fooling nobody. And don't even get me started on *Snopes* and their agenda.  

2. If you still think that you are living in a ""democracy"", where things happen by rule (unlike Russia/China/North Korea which are evil places manipulated by evil folks) - I may have some bad news for you. The Epstein incident should be eye-opener enough for you.  

3. Nearly all shootings that happen in your country of US are *manipulated* to achieve the gun-control objective. So that people have no means to defend themselves when the government ultimately decides to invade them. Trial runs of these things are managed in countries such as New Zealand - which was a massive success because their (both literal as well as metaphorical) ""sheep population"" willingly bought it in one go. Either psychologically imbalanced individuals are targeted, drugged, brainwashed and manipulated into doing this or hired sharpshooters are dedicated to the cause. Other side-objectives such as having a shooter of <insert race/religion here> are also achieved simultaneously for the purpose of spreading hate and fear.  

4. You have been lied to regarding the TRUTH about MH 370 and the MH 17 incidents. Yep, your folks had had something (all of it) to do with that.  

5. The entire 9/11 story is a fabrication.  

6. The British Royal Family, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Trumps, and, sorry to add, even Bernie Sanders are all part of the same elite circles that do horrible things. Because unless you aren't a part of the elite, you wouldn't even get CLOSE to the presidential race, let alone the presidential nomination.  

7. Feminism/feminists is manipulated and controlled by these folks to create further gender-wars and divide. (You can see how manipulated they are that they actually try to sell you the ridiculous idea that the Burqa/Hijab/Niqab is some form of women's empowerment). The response to it (Meninism) is also ""founded and run"" by these same folks. Black people, White people, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians - ALL are attacked under the orders of the very same people. If you have seen women replacing men as superheroes and other characters in movies (Ghostbusters, Oceans 8) - it is part of that DIVIDE AND CONQUER agenda. Gender pay gap is also a part of that exact same agenda. Meanwhile, they continue to oppress women on the side by denying them abortion rights, mistreating them etc and play both sides of the game. The same applies to black guys suddenly getting to play originally white characters. It's all manufactured to generate outrage, divide and rule. **[This ad is an excellent example of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0)**  

8. *Nearly* all rich and famous folks (the coveted 1%) are part of the ""dark side"" in some way or the other. Yes - you are going to see folks of the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffet for what they TRULY are to get ousted pretty soon. Don't say we didn't warn you later.  

9. Forced vaccination is a plan for something a lot, a LOT more nefarious than Autism. The Autism nonsense is just to keep people distracted from the real deal.  

10. Point no.9 mentioned above and Elon Musk's Neuralink are, well, *linked* very closely.  

11. Sorry, but global warming is a hoax too. These people you have put all of your faith in - these scientists, these researchers, these ""experts"" - when their true allegiances are revealed to you, you are going to feel, really, really stupid. The real thing that is causing a lot of this world's problems is something known as HAARP - but hey, can't have YOU FOLKS knowing THAT now, can we?  

12. If you see someone's image being marketed as that of a ""good guy"" for *far too long* - expect it to be the exact opposite in reality. Looking at you, Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Malala, United Nations and NATO.  

13. Some people take on a ""good guy image"" (Elon Musk). So that once the public fully begins to trust their intentions, they can give you your personalized eternal slavery toolkits such as Neuralink™.  

14. People like Alex Jones - and the real-life ""tinfoil hatters"" have been created to discredit/mock the actual awakened *conspiracy community*. Yes, we do have some folks who believe in baseless stuff without anything legitimate to back that up, but they are not the majority.  

15. This is the opposite of point #12. People who DO speak the truth, are branded by the powers-in-control as loons, addicts, or retards. Whatever suits their causes the best. E.g. Jim Carrey, Russel Brand, Kanye West, etc. Can't have these folks spilling all the beans now, can they?  

16. Celebrities who DO wish to tell the world the truth get killed. Usually through the kind of technologies that killed Osho (via giving him cancer), or the stuff that has been used to drain Julian Assange of his very life force (he'll probably not live too long either), and so on and so forth. They killed Michael Jackson. They also killed Robin Williams. And they also ""suicided"" a bunch of bankers not too long ago. Sometimes, they just shoot them in plain sight like they did with that one President dude called Kennedy.  

17. The Large Hadron Collider/Particle Accelerator had WAY more nefarious purposes than what you'd ever believe to be true.  

18. We have had the technology (obtained by reverse engineering) to visit Moon/Mars/Outer Reaches of our Solar System since a LONG, LONG time. So while the Moon mission wasn't exactly fake - it didn't show to the world what we really have. Or how often we use what we have to travel through this Solar System at mind-bending speeds.  

19. The Moon isn't what you think it is.  

20. Last but not the least, aliens exist. Always have. And many of them are literally light years ahead of us - both technologically, as well as spiritually. Deal with it.  

This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list. I just dropped the most important things that came to my mind at this time. There are many, many, many, many more things I could tell you but that would go on forever.  

Long story short, don't you *for a single second* believe that you are living in a world that is any different than what was described in the book 1984. Don't you *for a single second believe* that ""Russia"" is the only evil, dictatorial place where people get ""suicided"" and America's some kind of a *heaven.* Really, just *don't.* Because all of your delusions are about to get uprooted, real fast, real hard.  

All of your bankers, your pharma companies, your petroleum companies, your Nestle's and McDonalds and Cokes, your fancy fashion brands, your media, your educational systems, your scientific fraternity, your governments, your armies, your spy services, your police forces, your military-industrial complex, your religions, your politicians, your ""justice"" systems, and your *everything* is corrupted to its very core. This applies across countries, across borders, across the world. The ones of lesser light see humanity as slaves - and are wiling to do anything to use us for their greed, lust and even entertainment. **You have been manipulated physically, psychologically, socially and even** ***CHEMICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY*** **to the extent that even your DNA and your VERY SOUL has not remained untouched by their advanced nefarious technologies.**  

It is up to you to either sit in quiet acceptance of it, or to **do something about it before it takes away everything you have ever loved or valued.**  

**DISCLAIMER:** Just because evil has infiltrated and rotted everything in existence, does not mean that there are no good people left. In fact, without the good people, our world would be a 100% hell right now. So let me make it very, very clear that GOOD PEOPLE STILL DO EXIST. In your politics, in your Nestles and Cokes, in your police forces, in your armed forces, in your governments, in your spy forces, in your media, in your judicial systems, in your scientific field, in your educational fields, in your NASA, in your UN and even in your religions. Without these folks being there to balance things out, we'd all probably be COMPLETELY FUCKED AS A SPECIES by now. But these good people are usually powerless because as of yet, Earth is still under the rule of darker forces (such as the Illuminati etc) - and other good people from all across the world haven't joined hands yet to become a SINGLE, POWERFUL, INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE that the negative ones COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH. Because most of them are still buying into all those hate and division games. The day they wake the fuck up, is the day we'll be liberated as a species...  

Have a good day.  

**EDIT:** To those asking me to give proofs of my claims, or asking me to explain to them more about the moon, the Hadron Collider etc. I am *so not* going to do any of that. Try living **our life** for once. Go into the rabbit-holes of the internet, the YouTubes, the blogs and even the 4chans and the 8chans that you so despise. **READ** people's arguments for yourselves. **ANALYSE** the evidences presented. **FIGURE THINGS OUT** on your own. **THAT'S HOW YOU WILL AWAKEN.**  

Not by someone spoon-feeding you everything and you either (blindly) buying it, or else (blindly) rejecting it. THAT MENTALITY is what has got all of us here in the first place. Where everybody (blindly) believes their media, their governments, their politicians, their scientists, their celebrities, their teachers, their religious leaders and even their psychologists. Where everybody (blindly) believes in their society, their friends, their moms, their dads, their siblings and absolutely anyone else - WITHOUT GOING OUT THERE AND LOOKING UP/VERIFYING SHIT FOR THEMSELVES. And then we have a sleeping civilization that will believe in *literally anything.* Sorry, ain't gonna contribute to that madness.  

**EDIT 2:** So I found a few recurring themes/questions coming up within this post. I would be more than happy to address some of those.  

**Question 1:** Why you no provide proof?  

**Answer 1:** Hold it right there. Do you really think that when conspiracy theorists were making claims about Jeffrey Epstein WAY back - that they were doing so without posting proof? Oh, let me give you a better example. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (along with us ""nutcases"") were *screaming from rooftops* telling people they were being spied on. Entire troves of documents and other *proofs* accompanied their words. Did you all for a single second believe them? No, right? And what happened ultimately? They were proven all right, right? So don't you for a *single second* feign all of that ""innocence"" and *ask me for proofs* now when all you have done is *disregard* proofs for the entirety of your lives. Besides, we are all just *nutcases* here right? Why would you even believe someone you have already labelled a nutcase? That would be ridiculous.  

**Question 2:** But muh Donald Trump is *innocent.*  

**Answer:** *Is he?* Kindly go look up his attitude towards Saudi Arabia, his trigger-happy, war-friendly stance towards Iran, and report back to me regarding his true allegiances at your leisure. Get out of this ""Republican good, Democrat bad"" and ""Democrat good, Republican bad"" nonsense already. Because while you are busy defending their asses here, they are all just thinking of newer and better ways to trample yours. Yes, both of them. Sorry to break that to ya.  

**Question 3:** Do you really believe in Satan, it's 2019?  

**Answer 3:** Accepting that Satanic Rituals exist is not the same thing as accepting Satan exists. There are plenty, plenty of stories, witness accounts and testimonials about those out there. **Entire books have been written about the said rituals - and MANY at that.** And where there's smoke - there's usually fire. Go figure.  

**Question 4:** Doesn't your mentioning the moon completely ruin the whole point of this post?  

**Answer 4:** This one's the one that brought me the most laughs. Because I haven't even mentioned a *single theory* about the moon in this post. I haven't said whether the moon is hollow or not, or whether it is flat or not, or whether it is a ""projection"" or not. And yet, people here are already, well, ""projecting"" rather hard about what I *might have* intended to say. Perhaps it is indeed a projection then? Lol.  

See, this is why I left some of the stuff here open-ended. So that you lot here can come and project your preconceived notions and prejudices about such topics yet again. So that you can (already) decide as to what is ""believable"" and what sounds way too ""out there"" for your tiny minds to comprehend. But hey, there was a time when the idea that the government was spying on you was way too *""out there""*. Go figure.  

**Question 5:** Yes to everything except the Vaccination Part, the Global Warming part and the <insert name of concept ""sold"" to you by your mainstream media, social media, literally all scientists, literally all celebrities, literally all your friends, and even your neigbhbour's 3-day old puppy>.  

**Answer 5:** So you have already decided that you know everything about those topics. And clearly, since absolutely everyone upon this planet accepts them - they can't all be wrong, right?  

Let me give you an example to illustrate this point a tad better. Almost everyone on your planet agrees that believing in fairy tales and magic and any other ""out there"" concepts is either for kids or druggies or for complete retards. That believing in ""imaginary stuff"" makes you immature, stupid and dumb AF. **Strange then, that nearly all (so-called) ""mature, grown adults"" upon this planet** who are all intelligent ""homo-sapiens and everything"" **believe in imaginary borders, imaginary separations** between religion, creed, race, gender and whatnot **and buy all of those imaginary dreams** such as the American Dream/or that the ""media never lies"" and more. How wise and mature of them.  

**Question 6:** Why the fuck would the elite do all of this shit openly? They knew the entire country was watching them here. They'd be stupid to even try.  

**Answer 6:** Two reasons. I'll address the first one first. The reason that our Elite do a lot of things is NOT about whether it's the best thing to do or not. The reason is to remind the world just how very fucking powerful and untouchable they are. That they can get away with **absolutely anything,** right in front of humanity's noses and people will still buy all their BS and suck on their dicks at the end of the day. This is why they were so happy about ""predicting 9/11"" in like a ton of different places (yeah, WAY too many ""coincidences"" happening in there for all of these things to be organically happening) be it comics, cartoons, movies, or what-have-you. Manipulating entertainment to suit their agenda is something they have always done. The guys over at Disney would love to tell you how well they've all gotten at this shit. **They are ALL on the power-trip of a lifetime where no matter WHAT they do and HOW BLATANTLY THEY DO IT - humanity all laps it up and** ***worships*** **them regardless.** THIS IS WHY they thought offing Epstein right under the entire world's noses was a good idea. Alas! Times are a changin - and they are changing fast! And as their ship is fast sinking now, expect them to do many, many more such stupid things in desperation that only have an opposite effect to that which they had intended. For, as that recent movie title would gladly remind you, we are truly in the ""Endgame"" now. And nope, that title was no ""coincidence"" either.  

The reasons they do all of those horrifying paedo-sex-and-torture-ritual-cult-blood-sacrifice ceremonies is NOT because all of them were organically born as child rapists. The reasons they do it is for their *initiation.* To filter out the darkest from the dark. For only the greatest of psychopaths and monsters can even as much as *imagine* participating in one of those psychotic ceremonies. And then they continue to force these ""initiates"" into doing this on a regular basis to forever ensure that these people are still ""on their (dark) side"" and as leverage against them if any of them ever decides to turn against them. Hope this is making some sense to you now.

**Question 7:** Why TF are you making all of these tall claims? YOU are the one discrediting the community now.  

**Answer 7:** AM I? Here's a suggestion. Save this post. Try your best to survive for the next 10 years. Okay, let's just make it 5 years. And then, watch in horror as a ton of things mentioned herein get revealed to you. I hope 5 years isn't too much of a stretch for you. Because this entire revealing process might well take a 50 or even a 100. Why? Because the hiding has been going on for entire fucking millenia. So for the revealing to just take about a 100 is a massive achievement already. But I am not saying you have to wait that long. **You will get more than what you bargained for within the next 5 years alone.** That I guarantee you. So yeah, go convert this thread into a checklist. And begin ticking off items as and when they happen. I assure you, *I* won't be the one disappointing you here. Can't really say the same for your leaders, your businessmen, your doctors, your scientists, your judges, your media, etc. though.",conspiracy,Epstein

They spent a decade+ trying to reverse that and cultivate a more ""palatable"" website for TPTB, but a generation is now being raised on memes, and they no longer have the patience (or attention span) for the legacy fake news media.

If you've seen the netflix documentary about epstein you know that the documentary mostly focuses on the experiences of the individual victims. I'm NOT saying that the victims are lying, I 100 percent believe that Epstein Abused these poor girls.

However the legal case set forward by the girls isnt against any government institution (as it wouldn't be if they wanted any chance of winning the case), and the documentary largely ignored the larger facts surrounding epstein, it makes vague allusions to the fact that high profile people visited the island, all of the girls said that hundreds of girls came to the island but the case itself is made up of only 6 witnesses. 

I'm not even saying that its intentional, but the netflix documentary makes out that jeffrey Epstein was a predator who was only in it for himself. Which if I was the CIA or any other intelligence I would want that also, considering netflix ties to George Soros, I'm not surprised.

With the goal of provoking our absolute destruction at our own hands, America's enemies (which includes democracy-subverting politicians such as AOC) are amplifying existing divisions in this country through the *feedback loop* process of [**""SCHISMOGENESIS"".**](https://howautismworks.com/haw/schismogenesis-weaponized-communication)

Here's what the Pentagon itself has to say on this (note how not a single one of our politicians on either side has so much as made mention of the word ""schismogenesis"" in all this time since this report came out): 

> “**The process of creating societal rifts to expand existing divisions, and to Generate SELF-DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIORS was called SCHISMOGENESIS in 1935.** The Office of Strategic Services, an institutional precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, used this theory in the South Pacific during World War II to sow disunity among enemy fighters and to create schisms in communities supportive of Japanese rule. Likewise, **the recent rise of EXTREMIST POLITICS in the United States and in western Europe provides growing evidence that SCHISMOGENESIS appears to have been fueled by RUSSIA, CHINA, and Numerous Other Hostile Actors** who can benefit from the cost-effective method of weakening the rules-based international order without directly confronting the West.” - https://publications.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/3693.pdf -- Page 13
____

**AOC is a Chinese asset. That's the conspiracy. How do you know this is a fair charge and true?**

For starters, r/MurderedbyAOC is proof that few people do more to promote schismogenesis in this country than she does. Secondly, when asked to clarify the simple question as to whether or not she's a communist [**she deflects by calling those who label her as such ""white supremacists"".**](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-says-calling-people-communist-has-a-rich-history-in-white-supremacy)

Given the fact that I'm a Puerto Rican myself, just like she is, [**and am myself darker in skin tone than she herself is**](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5cc6655cfb182005b19d0972/1608922321981-RE95WOCHEIHYWHR9Z08S/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIAG7bX8zUDdlNmIpbLXtrt7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0h5sNgLxRi_vWf2sm4Qt5kkyZWNXXA6t_ls5aZv7Nq4B-1bhM-ZkAd1Km9SgO7vExA/iamme.png?format=2500w), that race-baiting deflection strategy isn't gonna work with me. So let's examine if she's full of commie shit or not. 

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has on a multitude of occasions identified herself as a ""democratic socialist"". Let's see what the *Democratic Socialists of America* (an organization she has endorsed as speaking to her views) have to say about whether or not they want to end capitalism and replace it with communism (mind you, ""communism"" itself is merely the delusion used to sell people on the dystopian path to it called ""socialism""). Note all the 1984 double-speak and heavy use of euphemisms throughout:

> **Q.** Private corporations seem to be a permanent fixture in the US, so why work towards socialism?

> **A.** **In the short term we can’t eliminate private corporations**, but we can bring them under greater democratic control.

*ELIMINATE??? Did you catch that? ""Greater democratic control"" = State Control (that's what they don't come out and say).*

_________

> **Q.** Won’t socialism be impractical because people will lose their incentive to work?

> **A.** We don’t agree with the **capitalist assumption** that starvation or greed are the only reasons people work. People enjoy their work if it is meaningful and enhances their lives. They work out of a sense of responsibility to their community and society. **Although a long-term goal of socialism is to eliminate all but the most enjoyable kinds of labor**, we recognize that unappealing jobs will long remain. **These tasks would be spread among as many people as possible** rather than distributed on the basis of class, race, ethnicity, or gender, as they are under capitalism.*

*Capitalist assumption? This is commie speak.*

*Eliminate all but the most enjoyable kinds of labor??? That's just sheer delusion.*

*Who's ""spreading"" these ""tasks""??? Who's doing this assigning if not a centrally planned government they deny they're for??? What if I don't want to do the task???*

___________

> **Q.** Why are there no models of democratic socialism?

> **A.** Although no country has fully instituted democratic socialism, the socialist parties and labor movements of other countries have won many victories for their people. **We can learn from the comprehensive welfare state maintained by the Swedes**, from Canada’s national health care system, France’s nationwide childcare program, and Nicaragua’s literacy programs.

*""Comprehensive welfare state""??? That's COMMUNISM.*
________

> **Q.** If I am going to devote time to politics, why shouldn’t I focus on something more immediate?

> **A.** **Although capitalism will be with us for a long time**, reforms we win now—raising the minimum wage, securing a national health plan, and demanding passage of right-to-strike **legislation—can bring us closer to socialism**.*

*Straight up commie bullshit on a stick.*

> **Q.** Doesn’t socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?

> **A.** **Democratic socialists do not want to create an all-powerful government bureaucracy** ... While the large concentrations of **capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives**.*

*Double-speak is so so tasty. Doubleplus-yumgood!*

*This is communism. Who the fuck is guiding these ""cooperatives""? Workers? Dream on. We can't even be bothered to vote on major elections and we're gonna be devoting ourselves to this constant demand for feedback? Give me a fucking break. It's going to be centrally planned by an ""elite"" politburo (as always) that will shut down and oppress all future grass roots movements.*",conspiracy,Epstein
114,A big bad event will soon happen in order to distract us from Epstein getting suicided.,2596.0,coivq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/coivq3/a_big_bad_event_will_soon_happen_in_order_to/,442.0,1565448187.0,"Dont forget that. They are manipulating us and we fall for it like sheep.

115,"Epstein was a CIA asset. The main players behind the worldwide child trafficking scandal are none other than the secret services - CIA, MI6, Mossad. Here is a collection of evidence.",2590.0,cp0amg,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cp0amg/epstein_was_a_cia_asset_the_main_players_behind/,207.0,1565547831.0,"Following the Epstein ""suicide"", it's more clear than ever that there is an organization which uses children in pedophilic sex parties, in order to blackmail and control powerful people. These children are frequently murdered by these sick individuals. Some can also be traumatized for the purpose of creating dissociative personalities so they can be mind-controlled. For a full breakdown of the worldwide scandals, see [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/689fwv/evidence_of_child_abuse_in_majorly_influential/) and [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9274Q8jv_wM) - both of which are non-exhaustive and already out of date, such is the scale of this operation.

Common traits of these scandals are:

* Children kidnapped and used in sex parties for blackmail purposes
* Clear police involvement, by making errors in their investigations which let perpetrators go free, not following up on leads, etc.
* Police teams being changed, where one police team would be making progress on an investigation, then be dismissed and another police team being brought in which clearly has an agenda to discredit/ignore existing witnesses/evidence
* National or (more rarely) local media discrediting victim-witnesses, calling them liars, following a clear anti-victim agenda
* Judges giving harsh sentences to child witnesses and lenient sentences on perpetrators
* Witnesses and investigators being threatened and intimidated, vehicles malfunctioning, anonymous phone calls, etc
* Witnesses and investigators being murdered, or dying in suspicious circumstances (suicide despite no personal problems, or convenient ""accidents"")

Now ask yourself, what is the one type of organization which can accomplish all of these things? There is only one.

The **secret services**.

The only organization which would have the authority and the means to accomplish all these feats, to assert such a degree of control over all the outcomes, is military intelligence. Other entities may be involved - billionaires for example - but money can only accomplish so much. Yes you can purchase a newspaper and have journalists write something, but you can't just pay someone to murder someone in a prison and make it look like suicide. Prison security need to be moved, clearance needs to be given. People need to be so scared that they keep their mouth shut. The only way you do this is by having significant amounts of money and resources at your disposal, but also *authority* over them.

Here is a collection of evidence supporting this assertion:

1. Epstein flew a helicopter which shared tail numbers with a covert US military helicopter used by [DynCorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DynCorp). Dyncorp has a history of child trafficking scandals in many countries and is owned by Steve Feinberg (US intelligence board). Epstein's pilot is rumored to be in US intelligence and a Mossad agent, Junkerman, has flown on his jet. [Summary](https://i.redd.it/y6u9zvu4e3f31.png). Epstein's close associate, [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell), is the child of media baron Robert Maxwell, who had links to British, Israeli, and Russian secret service.
Epstein got off very lightly in 2008 for sexually abusing underage girls. The current labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, gave him a very lenient deal. Who can pull the strings to make this happen? Either Acosta is a part of the conspiracy, or another entity was forcing his hand - the only entity that is capable of doing so is military intelligence.
AG William Barr worked in Epstein's legal team. Barr's father, Donald Barr, was in the OSS, which was the precursor to the CIA. Donald Barr gave Epstein his first job as a math teacher in an elite, politically connected school, even though Epstein did not have any qualifications or even a college degree.
And assuming that Epstein didn't commit suicide, whoever had him killed was able to make a murder look like suicide, inside a prison, while the target was under suicide watch. Guards were apparently told to leave the area due to maintenance, and CCTV camera footage was either prevented or confiscated [Source](https://twitter.com/BreakingNLive/status/1160235309596139520). Only military intelligence operatives have the resources to pull this off. Epstein's murder, whether real or faked, was the CIA disposing of a loose asset.

2. It is a documented historical fact that the CIA engaged in child trafficking, including child sexual abuse, to blackmail useful officials, in the [MK Ultra project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra). [Source 1](https://www.newsweek.com/project-mkultra-documents-cia-brainwashing-techniques-black-vault-1073061) [Source 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn8XMlqcVcg). Note that only a small portion of the documents for this project ever came to light - the majority were destroyed.

3. The Franklin Scandal. The ring leader of the pedophile blackmail ring, Larry King, had ties to US Intelligence. [Source, page 34](http://the-eye.eu/public/Books//4chan_pol_Archives/PDFs/Miscellaneous%20Unsorted/pol/pol%20books%2014%20-%20nov%202016/The%20Franklin%20Scandal%20-%20Nick%20Bryant%20%282009%29.pdf) In a subsequent scandal involving a ""call-boy ring"" in Washington D.C., an associate of King's, Craig Spence, committed suicide in a hotel. The mysterious Spence was ""a CIA asset"" and had bugged his home so he could blackmail powerful people. [Source, page 279](http://the-eye.eu/public/Books//4chan_pol_Archives/PDFs/Miscellaneous%20Unsorted/pol/pol%20books%2014%20-%20nov%202016/The%20Franklin%20Scandal%20-%20Nick%20Bryant%20%282009%29.pdf)

4. Paul Bonacci, who was awarded $1m by a judge for the sexual abuse done to him by Larry King, was also involved in a MK-Ultra follow-up mind control operation called Monarch (also confirmed by other survivors). He directly named [Colonel Michael Aquino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Set#Foundation) as one of the leads in the project. Aquino worked for navy intelligence. Around this time, allegations of child sex abuse were being leveled at army bases all over the United States. [Source](http://humansarefree.com/2016/12/the-conspiracy-against-michael-aquino.html). So it seems, at least in the 70s and 80s, there was a dedicated program by the US military for child trafficking, sexual abuse, and mind control.

5. The Belgium Scandal. A key witness, Regina Louf, alleged that convicted child rapist and murderer Marc Dutroux kidnapped children, including her, for businessman Michel Nihoul. Louf alleged that Nihoul had hidden cameras and that she had to make sure her rapists were in the camera's field of view. Louf's allegations were independently corroborated by many other witnesses, many of whom could give intimate case details such as room layouts. Nihoul was found not guilty, after judges overruled the jury's guilty verdict. Louf was also discredited by the Belgian government's own TV station, which labelled her a deranged liar.
The case was the subject of a massive public outcry after police made a huge number of serious mistakes, such as even neglecting to search a basement after children's voices could be heard - this mistake led to the children starving to death in their basement cell. Many witnesses related to the case died in mysterious circumstances, such as committing suicide despite having no personal problems, or having car accidents.[Source 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djmm7GrgsUk) [Source 2](https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil#12)
Again, which organization has the ability to influence national media, influence senior judges, influence police, and kill people to make it look like suicide or an accident? The security services.

6. The Hampstead cover-up, in which two children related that their father forced them to engage in satanic ritual abuse at their school and at a church, as well as pedophilic parties with their father's friends, including cutting off babies' heads. Babies were supplied to the cult by social services. An experienced police detective is on record saying he believed the children and their mother. The authorities quickly closed ranks on the situation, with a judge removing the children from their mother, which goes against lawful procedure. Medical examinations by experienced professionals proved that the children had been sexually abused (vaginal and anal examinations). Crucial evidence was withheld from hearings. Child protection authorities and the Home Office was silent and inactive. 
To cover up information related to the case, all major media outlets were served with a defense advisory (DA) notice - *a DA notice is an official request to news editors not to publish or broadcast items on specified subjects which would compromise military or intelligence operations*. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwoe2eB-Bo).

7. In 1987 a satanic cult in Washington D.C., the Finders, was investigated after children were seen being apparently trafficked by two well-dressed men. At the properties of the Finders, investigators discovered evidence of satanic ritual abuse, blackmail, sophisticated communication technology, and explosives. The CIA took over the investigation and declared it an ""internal matter"". No further investigation was permitted. [Source](https://youtu.be/33cijzHhPow?t=2241)

8. Ronald Bernard confesses in an emotional interview about having to sacrifice children to prove yourself as a psychopath in the financial elite. He also says that ""secret services are actually criminal organizations ... they will stop at nothing. They have their flows of money from trading drugs, weapons, people. All that money has to come from somewhere, everything has to be financed."" [Source](https://youtu.be/xC62iJ_oXDE?t=1101)

9. The Jersey scandal (full breakdown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/aq8935/we_need_to_talk_about_the_island_of_jersey/)). A policeman, Lenny Harper, investigating a children's care home (which Jimmy Savile frequently visited), claims he recovered forensic evidence that children were killed and incinerated in the basement. In March 2008, BBC television personality Jimmy Savile started legal proceedings against The Sun newspaper which had, wrongly he claimed, linked him in several articles to the child abuse scandal at Haut de la Garenne. Savile initially denied visiting Haut de la Garenne, but later admitted that he had done so, following the publication of a photograph showing him at the home surrounded by children. The States of Jersey Police said that in 2008 an allegation of an indecent assault by Savile at the home in the 1970s had been investigated, but there had been insufficient evidence to proceed.
The forensic evidence found on the site was repeatedly compromised when it was sent to the UK for analysis. Lenny Harper received many death threats and was attacked by Jersey's local media, and some national media outlets. A journalist who later tried to investigate was arrested, held for 12 hours at Heathrow airport, and banned from the island. [Vice article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xd4954/the-journalist-who-was-banned-from-investigating-jerseys-child-abuse)
The list of suspects in the case include British government officials. According to Harper, Chief Minister for Jersey Frank Walker (OBE) warned Harper that his investigation could ""bring the government down"".
In September 2008, the investigation team was changed. David Warcup, the leader of the new team, said there was ""no evidence"" that children were killed at Haut and that Harper's information he gave to the press were not accurate. Warcup said that the bones were animal bones and that the 60 milk teeth had come out naturally. [Telegraph article 2](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3446619/Jersey-police-chief-suspended-as-claims-of-child-murders-ripped-up.html) The new team also claimed that a child's skull was actually a piece of coconut (citing no scientific analysis), going against statements made by two anthropologists that it was a skull fragment as it contained collagen, and moreover that it was ""fleshed and fresh"" when it had been burned. [Source](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3446619/Jersey-police-chief-suspended-as-claims-of-child-murders-ripped-up.html) Warcup said that the bones which were found could have been hundreds of years old, however an expert told Harper that they could only be a few decades old. [Source 2](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/jersey-probe-lenny-harper-hits-back-28454432.html)
MP John Hemming said that he had no doubt that there were efforts to cover up the murder evidence. [BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7534350.stm)

10. A man called Carl Beech claimed that in the 70s and 80s he and a number of other boys were raped by powerful people in London. He made claims specifically against twelve people, including the former Members of Parliament Harvey Proctor (who had already been convicted of gross indecency for having sex with teenage boys) and Greville Janner, the former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, the former Prime Minister Edward Heath, the former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Bramall, the former Director of the Secret Intelligence Service Maurice Oldfield, and the former Director-General of MI5 Michael Hanley. Beech claimed that he was abused at a number of places including Dolphin Square, the Carlton Club, and various other places in the Home Counties. Beech also falsely claimed that the group murdered three children: two for sexual pleasure, and a third to intimidate the others. Proctor's solicitors told him that Beech had alleged that he had seen Proctor repeatedly stab a 12-year-old boy before strangling him to death, and that he himself had been raped by Proctor.
The officer leading the investigation, Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald, said in December 2014 that experienced officers had concluded that the allegations were ""credible and true"". McDonald was later criticised for the statement, and it was retracted. The investigating team was changed, no further evidence was found, and Beech was sentenced to 19 years in prison. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midland)

11. Natacha Jaitt, a playboy model, alleged that she had evidence of a VIP child abuse ring, involving journalists and politicians in Argentina. She tweeted that ""Notice: I will not commit suicide. I won’t be bought off or drown in a bath tub, nor will I shoot myself in the head. So, if that happens: I wasn’t me. Save this tweet."" She was later found dead of an apparent drug overdose - her lawyer and brother suspect foul play. [Source](https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/26/model-tried-expose-paedophile-ring-found-dead-8744960/)

12. Former police officer Mark Minnie wrote an explosive book detailing a pedophile ring in South African government. Minnie, 58, was found with a bullet to his head, but many people are refusing to believe the police version - that he took his own life at the farm of a friend near the coastal city of Port Elizabeth.
""The fact that the suicide note was found doesn't necessarily mean he wrote it willingly. I mean he could've written it under duress. The fact that he shot himself with someone else's pistol already raises questions,"" investigative journalist and author Jacques Pauw told South Africa's radio 702. [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45195756)

13. Imane Fadil was a Moroccan ex-model who became a celebrity after becoming a key witness in the 2013 “Rubygate” trials which accused the media mogul and ex-Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi of “child prostitution”. Fadil was also looking to be a witness in a related investigation (dubbed “Ruby ter”) that is still ongoing.
In 2018, Fadil claimed in an interview that Berlusconi’s infamous “parties” lead to dark, satanic rituals. She was also in the process of writing a tell-all book about Rubygate and the dark secrets of Berlusconi. The name of the projected book was quite evocative: I Met the Devil.
However, in the past weeks, things dramatic turn. Imane Fadil died in a hospital room in Milan on March 1st after a month of agony. Media sources reported her death only 15 days after the fact, mostly because authorities announced the opening of a homicide investigation. Indeed, the cause of Fadil’s death is currently believed to be “murder by radioactive poisoning”.

That same night Jeffery Epstein flew [his private jet to Saudi Arabia](https://www.insider.com/epstein-riyadh-saudi-arabia-private-jet-2019-9), where he reportedly met with soon to be Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The meeting was about [Saudi Vision 2030](https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en), which is Saudi Arabia's version of [UN Agenda 2030](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda). Epstein was very familiar with both of these initiatives as he was a member of the [Trilateral Commission who drafted the original version](https://archive.is/Sqbno) of the initiative known as Agenda 21. It is believed that these initiatives are behind the chaos we are currently living.

Trump spent his early days in office becoming friendly with Saudi Arabia, building strong relationships with its elite and [touching creepy orbs](https://i.imgur.com/1xAOQba.jpg) with them. In June of 2017 Mohammed bin Salman was [appointed Crown Prince](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/06/saudi-crown-prince-mohammed/531075/), and Trump wasted no time in congratulating him. Not everyone in SA was pleased with MBS being named crown prince, most notably prince al-Waleed bin Talal...who owned a soon to be important piece of real estate in Las Vegas.

Fast forward to October 1st 2017, when the infamous Harvest Music Festival Shooting occurred. The official story is lone gunman Stephen Paddock fired into the crowd from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay. You may remember that the story kept changing in the days that followed, and if you build off the police scanner and 911 calls ([which this website does a great job of](https://www.intellihub.com/timeline-of-hell-las-vegas-shooting/)) the story changes to multiple shooters forcing their way up the strip, shooting into multiple hotels. Also worth noting, the floors above where Paddock allegedly shot from are actually part of ""[The Four Seasons](https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-guide/las-vegas-nevada/hotels/four-seasons-at-mandalay-bay)"" a separate hotel [owned by prince al-Waleed bin Talal and Bill Gates](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/13/2) (another big Agenda 2030 player) [This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7b1kzk/the_las_vegas_shooting_and_the_mass_arrests_in/) does a great job breaking down the Saudi involvement theory in detail. If you're looking for a TLDR instead, the theory is that Paddock was an arms dealer and personal pilot for prince al-Waleed bin Talal, who ordered an assassination on MBS who was in Vegas at the time. When the hit team realized they were compromised they killed Paddock and began shooting from his window to create a diversion. They then made there way through the chaos on the streets in an attempt to escape. This is backed up by the infamous video (which youtube kept removing) that showed a man who resembled [MBS being escorted out of the Tropicana](https://i.imgur.com/yQQW02R.png) by an armed security team. This becomes more plausible when you consider that a few weeks later Kushner made an [unannounced visit to Saudi Arabia](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/29/jared-kushner-saudi-arabia-244291) which was followed by [MBS arresting several princes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-waleed-bin-talal.html), including prince al-Waleed bin Talal.

About a year later, the news of Jammal Khashoggi's assassination broke, and fingers were immediately pointed at MBS ([something the media is hammering down toda](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html)y) Jammal Khashoggi isn't the most famous in his family though, as his uncle Adnan Khashoggi was a big time arms dealer. He had many powerful friends, one being Donald Trump, who bought [Adnan's yacht in 1987](https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/editorial-features/trump-princess-inside-donald-trumps-lavish-86m-superyacht--34381). Around that same time Adnan Khashoggi was [involved in the Iran Contra](https://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=530172b9-7e7a-4933-acbc-f864f683863a) scandal with another power and familiar friend...

Fast forward to August 2019, when news broke of Jeffery Epstein's arrest. When the FBI searched his home, they found a safe full of money, diamonds, and a fake passport. The passport had Epstein's picture with a fake name, and had his residence [listed as being in Saudi Arabia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbB49DABQHs). Shortly after Vicky Ward appeared on MSNBC and claimed to have [sources that prove Epstein and Adnan's business together](https://youtu.be/Ip7VmFyGy-s?t=436), and hinted at Epstein's involvement in the Iran Contra scandal.

It is probably worth noting that a month later Jeff Bezos' phone was [hacked by crown prince MBS](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/21/21075990/saudi-arabia-crown-pince-mbs-amazon-jeff-bezos), who allegedly gained access to Bezos' phone through a Whatsapp file.

Then there's Bill Gates, which I could write a post longer than this one is so far about his shadiness. We already connected him to prince al-Waleed bin Talal, but he also has extensive ties to Jeffery Epstein. Gates denied meeting with Epstein, [despite proven records of them meeting several times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnKQ4tzg7ow), including after Epstein's conviction. A lot of [money was secretly transferred](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-jeffrey-epstein-friendship-swedish-mother-daughter-meeting-2019-10) between the 2 of them, and Gate's science advisor [Boris Nikolic was named to be named backup executor of Epstein will](https://www.foxnews.com/us/jeffrey-epstein-will-bill-gates-ex-science-adviser-boris-nikolic-named-executor) 2 days before his death. Little is known about their connection, they both share a common interest in eugenics, and both had a hand in planning UN Agenda 2030. Everything else is left up to the imagination.

So if this is all connected, what was Trumps role in it, and which side was he on? He appeared to be friendly with all of these people in his early days ([pictured here with Adnan Khashoggi and Ghislanes father Robert Maxwell](https://i.imgur.com/W5uLbcY.jpg)) But in more recent years he seemed to distant himself from them. He allegedly [kicked Epstein out of Mar Lago over inappropriate behavior](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/trump-banned-jeffrey-epstein-from-mar-a-lago-for-hitting-on-girl.html), and all of them were arrested when he took office. He also seemed to declare he will not be partaking in Agenda 2030 when he told the UN General Assembly [""the future does not belong to globalists""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wJ8tdxDVgI) Maybe he turned on them, and all of these events were part of a ""battle of the elite"" that had been raging through his time in office.

Solving the problem of organized pedophilia rings solves the problem of widespread government corruption. These people need trials and the harshest possible sentencing.

Imagine the scumbag astroturfers that think it's okay to help cover this stuff up. It is called obstruction of justice and they should be tried for their participation in RICO, as well.

Donald Trump is a scumbag hypocrite that doesn’t care about you and only wants power. He also has multiple sexual allegations against them. He has known Epstein and were great friends for decades. If you love Trump but hate The Clintons you are a fool.



This is how they divide and conquer. They both have a pile of evidence, testimonies against them, an open history of knowing what Epstein did, yet still hung out with him.
Both of them wanted Epstein dead and was scared of information getting out.

Trump and the Clintons are actual friends. Ivanka Trump and Chelsea Clinton are literally best friends. Trump has donated to the Clintons and invited the Clintons to his own wedding. He was also very upset that he couldn’t go to Chelsea’s wedding and called many people to talk about how “he should be there.” The Clintons have been bought off by Trumps money (and many many many others) and instead of fighting for the working class they used their powers to help make Trump and other billionaires richer and more powerful. They are literally two sides of the same coin.

Clinton has flown on the Lolita express. Trump has flown on the Lolita express. Trump hired Alexander Acosta who was the Florida prosecutor that gave the most sweetheart deal to Epstein and was the reason Epstein walked free. Clinton was seen on Epstein’s island. There was a picture of Clinton in a dress in Epstein’s house. Trump made comments about knowing that Epstein liked underaged girls back in the 80s yet still partied with him.

You can disagree with someone and call them a retard and not get banned. However, people come here to learn about current events and learn about conspiracy theories, and we are being hijacked in this election season (again).

Some kind user in another conspiracy sub showed me the Bot Sentinel plugin. I was surprised to see how rampant bots were, and I realized that a lot of times I was getting angry at bots, then taking it out on real people.

There's a lot of warfare here about left vs right. I would advise people to understand that different things motivate us and we see things differently, but what unites us is our desire for freedom and to fight back against the power of the so-called elite. It is quite sickening that at a time when so many people are waking up to crimes like child trafficking, we are faced with a choice between two old men both accused of being pedos. Epstein is dead (maybe) and Ghislaine is facing trial, but why aren't we hearing daily updates about what the FBI is doing to root out their network, the way we heard Ken Starr talk about cum on a blue dress and secret meetings with the Russians in Trump Tower.

I really feel a change is coming, and I think this community can be a major part of that change. Whatever you think of Coronavirus, it is doing one incredibly good thing...it is blowing the cover clean off the workings of of the elite. Our society has been brainwashed to worship billionaires and we're told that we should trust half of our money with them, but where are they now? They are useless. They only use their money to preserve their positions of power.

But the jig is up. Half the country just isn't going into work and the country is surviving. The ""reality"" we were forced to buy into by the ruling elite, media, politicians, etc is all falling apart. They're even losing control of the stock market. They pumped $1.5 TRILLION into the market, but a surprise happened. A bunch of regular people on RobinHood jumping in and scored some of that cash. Now, the elite are expecting the market to crash again so they can extend their gains, but it isn't happening on their schedule. We know the stock market means nothing about the economy. It is just a rich person's casino, and the RH users flooding the market are fucking up the computer algorithms that companies spend millions to write.

The reason I'm posting this here is that this sub has become a thought leader. We're no longer obscure tin foil hatters, but conspiracies are now mainstream. People will continue to flood this sub, and what is posted here gets echoed around the internet.

As a group, we don't agree on much, and that's fine. But I think it's safe to say that we all agree you can't trust the elite. Any of them. They wouldn't be allowed into the club if they weren't willing to play by the rules.

We are at a point where we can take down the elite parasites. We can destroy the corrupt Hollywood culture that harbors and promotes sexualization of children and just plain decadent excess. We can lead the movement to rid the world of billionaires who make their money through modern day slavery, corrupt government deals, working as fronts for spy agencies, then buy off politicians to make our lives worse so even affording a doctor's visit is a luxury today. We can fight corporations who fund CIA-developed propaganda campaigns in the form of ""marketing"" and mass media.

So, in closing, I just wanted to give a little pep talk to the sub to understand the potential we have here, and hopefully we can take advantage of this opportunity and bring secrecy and corruption to light. Even if we disagree, we are united in our desire to make the world a better place, free from evil, corruption, suppression and slavery.",conspiracy,Epstein

I don’t know how I can put it more clearly: Donald Trump is a second-generation real estate mogul turned President with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. All of his most successful business ventures cater to the ultra wealthy. Who do you think finances his campaign? For crying out loud, the President shits on a gold toilet seat in a Manhattan tower bearing his name and was photographed holding a mysterious glowing orb with the Saudi royal family.

And then, on the other end, we get brigades from Donald supporters. It's strange that /r/conspiracy has become the battleground for the political ideas on Reddit since /r/politics has become a place where you just get the DNC establishment narrative and has been abandoned by people who want to find the truth.

But let me try to explain the slight support of Trump that comes naturally here compared to the disdain toward Hillary. Hillary is a proven swamp monster. She is proven to be above the law. With Trump, there was a slight hope that the swamp would be drained. He ran on that, although he may have just been lying. We'll see, but he wasn't a proven swamp monster. He may be one. If so, he is just more of the same to us conspiracy minded people. Nothing different. Nothing to be more outraged about than we were before. But he may not be a swamp monster. With Hillary, we have a proven swamp monster of the greatest sort running free from any justice. 

As if anyone can speak for the conspiracy community as a whole, but we are generally a group for justice. And we wouldn't be upset if Trump would be prosecuted for wrongs that he does. But we would really like to see the swamp monsters prosecuted and not just use the justice system used by the powerful to go after their political opponents while they get off for equal or worse crimes. 

So if Trump is prosecuted for Russian interactions, then Hillary should be too. And whoever else was involved in the bribes for uranium through the Clinton Foundation. We don't want to see justice unfairly given toward one side or the other. 

So the post trying to connect Trump more to Epstein than Bill Clinton who was actually a frequent flyer comes across as very disingenuous. Although, it has received a lot of traction here for some reason. But it's hypocritical to be outraged at Trump's connections to him and not totally outraged at the Clintons, who are, unfortunately, still relevant to our political environment.

But the mainstream media only pushes for justice to be given to Trump, and that keeps our conspiracy antennas on high alert. If they were also going after crimes committed during the Obama administration the same way, you wouldn't feel that we were taking a side. We just want equal justice. We desire a society free or corruption. At the core, I think that is what most of us conspiracy people are about.

Maxwell pleads not guilty

Maxwell used alias to buy New Hampshire house.  Placed cell phone in foil.

Defendant offers not a single penny for bond, asks to stay at a luxury New York hotel.

The government received a written statement from Jane Doe:
I knew Ghislaine for 10 years.  Dehumanizing abuse awaited me with Epstein.  Without Ghislaine, Epstein couldn't have done what he done.  She thought it was funny.  She entrapped them with caring.  She was predator and monster.  She would do anything to satisfy Mr. Epstein.  She blatantly disregards judicial system.  I have great fear that she damages anyone influential in her procesuctoin.  I received a phone call threatening my life if I testify.  I know the truth.  I know what she has done I know how many lives she has ruined, she has no remorse.  Please do not let us down.  If she is out, I need to be protected.  She will disappear at a moments notice.  Or make others disappear if she needs to.

""I met maxwell when I was 16 she was a predator who abused me and countless others. has never shown any remorse.  she has lied under oath and tormented survivors.  She must be taken seriously.  She has associates across globe with great means.  She is a significant flight risk.  We may never kno3 how many were victimized. She must answer to her crimes.""  - Mrs Farmer

Mr Cohen - defendant - ""Thank you.  This is a very important proceeding for my client.  It is critical that under the bail format and related case law, none of which was discussed, she ought to be released.  Frankly, in order to defend a case like this during covid, the motion to preparing ad efense under these conditions is not realistic.  Our client is not J. Epstein. She has been the target of senseless media spin.  Trying to portray her as a sinister person.  We have a proceeding now where the govt is claiming facts that were not included in the opening memorandum.""

JUDGE INTERUPTS "" those 3 cases that you cited, did any of those cases involve a defendant with substantial international connection?""

""No. I don't believe they did."" Defendant

""Fact 1: risk of flight because she's been hiding out. She's been litigating several cases in this courthouse since 2015, denying that she did anything improper.  That is the opposite of someone who is likely to flee.""  Defendant

""My client was at the property in the morning in her pajamas with one security guard the front door was unlocked. all other doors were open.  the windows were open.  dozens of agents came up the drive.  my client had to hire security because of the threats.  the protocol was to go into another room.  that's what she did.  not running into the house looking for a secret tunnel.  the agents knocked down the door, which by the way was open.""  Defendant

""She starts getting strange emails.  Her phone was hacked.  So she keeps it.  Why? Her obligation is to keep it. Not destroy it.  She puts it in tinfoil or a bag that used for these purposes.  IF she were to say this phone is hacked and threw it away, she would have been more of a flight risk.  Its just smitten.  And last quote on this your honor is most telling thing of on, the agency did a security sweep, they talked to security guard, and they say who lives in the house, how do you get groceries, I go out and get them for her.  The governments allegations is that the person who is aware of criminal investigation has her counsel is living in a property in the united states. that's the opposite of hiding.  so we thin that those kinds of facts - I'm sure we'll have more facts.  We just learned this your honor, we bene investigation this case for 10 years""  Defendant

""If the court desires to leave the proceeding open for a week, information, financial issues, we think that now that we have some ability to breath, we should be able to put this together for the court.  We put together the best package on limited notice, who has been held in solitary confinement since she's been arrested.  She's been kept alone with lights on all the time.  Who's not allowed to speak with us.  Not allowed to shower for 72 hours.  Had her legal materials taken from her.  We've been trying to answer questions regarding financial questions that is by the government design.""  Defendant

""one last point in that regard, the schedule we set today, the government was saying it needs at least until NOv. to complete discovery, they've told us that there's 2 investigations, one of our client and one of Mr. Epstein, and they are together.  The notion that we would be able in any meaningful way to review these with our client under the current pandemic is not realistic and not fair."" Defendant

Plaintiff "" your honor my colleagues are here on behalf of New York. These are the facts. It is not dirt. It is not spins. That is evidence. and the notion that anyone can read the indictment that an adult woman .... it appears it is undisputed that defendant was in hiding. there was not spin. those are facts.""

""No offer of surrender was ever made."" Plaintiff

Plaintiff - ""She can't remember how many millions of dollars she has""

JUDGE _ ""Mr. Cohen argued that you failed to address the standards that burden is under statutory provision that you avoided the fact that the burden of a risk of flight whether there were measures that ensure appearance. do you dispute anything legally mr cohen applies?""

Plaintiff ""She has failed to meet that burden""

Defendant "" MR. Epstein had prior felony charge.  Its a very different situation than this case.  The last point, your honor, and I'll end it at this.  What we sometimes see in bail cases the government says well Defendant was hiding, and we have evidence, that defendant was making plans to leave the country.  Theres nothing to that effect here.  To the contrary, our client was sitting in New Hampshire.  There is no evidence for the court to consider.  We thank the court for your time.""

""Detention pending trial. Waives in favor of detention due to minor victims. In total Maxwell faces up to a 35 year maximum. The governments evidence appear strong."" JUDGE

""Mrs Maxwell poses a risk of flight."" JUDGE

""Mrs Maxwell extraordinary financial resources.  The court believes the representations by the Govt. ....  The absence of family ties or employment, believes flight would pose an ....  the defendant maintains that the defendant is not a flight risk, after arrest of Epstein, and ongoing investigation into co-cospinrators, she has stayed in contact with governent.  The fact that Maxwell did not flee is a siginifcant argument, but Court does not give it controlling fee.""  JUDGE

""The reality that Mrs Maxwell will face such serious charges perhaps have not set in until this indictment"" JUDGE

""Court concludes that even the most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient."" JUDGE",conspiracy,Epstein

In a newly published interview on Popula by journalist Maria Bustillos (via Deadline), Bourdain envisioned Weinstein naked in his bathroom having a stroke. The late chef and television host told Bustillos he’d prefer to see Weinstein “beaten to death in his cell.”  “My theory of how he goes is uh, he’s brushing his teeth in a bathroom, he’s naked in his famous bathrobe, which is flapping open, he’s holding his cell phone in one hand because you never know who on the Weinstein board has betrayed him recently, and he’s brushing his teeth,” Bourdain said. “He suddenly gets a massive fucking stroke.”  “He stumbles backwards into the bathtub,” Bourdain continued, “where he finds himself um, with his robe open feet sticking out of the tub, and in his last moments of consciousness as he scrolls through his contacts list trying to figure out who he can call, who will actually answer the phone.”  Bourdain said he imagined Weinstein dying “knowing that no one will help him and that he is not looking his finest at time of death.” The interview between Bourdain and Bustillos was conducted in February in New York City but wasn’t published until Sunday, July 15, just over a month after Bourdain died. The lengthy discussion also finds Bourdain criticizing Bill Clinton as a “piece of shit” and praising Barack Obama as “the most gracious.”  “Bill Clinton, look, the bimbo eruptions—it was fucking monstrous,” Bourdain said. “That would not have flown today. A piece of shit. Entitled, rapey, gropey, grabby, disgusting, and the way that he—and she—destroyed these women and the way that everyone went along, and, and are blind to this! Screamingly apparent hypocrisy and venality.”  Bourdain pointed out how “unforgivable” it is that Bill and Hillary Clinton buried women like Monica Lewinsky after they came forward about Bill’s indiscretions. “When you’re in the room, you think wow, she’s really warm and nice and funny,” Bourdain said about Hillary. “But the way they efficiently dismantled, destroyed, and shamelessly discredited these women for speaking their truth is unforgivable.”](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/07/anthony-bourdain-harvey-weinstein-death-bill-clinton-interview-1201984322/#!)

I found some of the evidence, specifically around Pizzagate, absolutely shocking but also convincing. 

Jeffrey Epsteins arrest also solidified this, because the conspiracies surrounding him being a human trafficker existed far beyond his final conviction, that man was a conspiracy theory before his final arrest. 

However you also feel like your starting to become a little paranoid because the media begins to frame the theory as paranoid. 

I'd got to talking to an old man in my church and i found out he had been a Child Psychologist for 40 years, a successful one too. And I asked him, ""As a child psychologist, what would you say if I told you there is a conspiracy theory, that thousands of children are being trafficked and also bred, then shipped all around the world to be sexually abused by the most powerful people In society?"" 

Bear in mind this isnt London or New York this is wales, UK. 

But I promise you he told me ""in my years of experience I can tell you that is absolutely true."" 

He then proceeded to tell me quite graphic and horrible details of children he had worked with. How they knew things about local politicians that theres no reason for a child to make up, and the huge amount of mental damage he's seen in some of these children.

That was a seriously sobering moment.

Edit: Reading some of these comments has made me think it's time to try to get in contact with him to see if he can get me some sort of records or see if anything led to any conviction,  or why he did/didn't tell authorities.

197,Marc Dutroux,1450.0,hrfjsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hrfjsy/marc_dutroux/,296.0,1594781054.0,"The story I'm about to tell you is true.

Perhaps the most intriguing part of this story is that every single person reading this post - every single one of you - was alive when this story became news in 2004.

That fact is intriguing because everyone reading this post has either never heard this story, or forgot about it (I'm betting on the first one, because it is truly unforgettable).

Furthermore, once you hear this story in its entirety, I can promise it will be seared into your memory forever.

Our main character is a man named Marc Dutroux. He was born in Belgium in 1956. He was twice convicted of kidnapping and raping underage children. The first time was in 1989. The second time occurred in 1996.

That was not a typo - you read that correctly. He was convicted and served a (much too brief) sentence in 1998. He served only 3 and a half years of his 13 year sentence because he was released for good behavior. Less than 10 years later, he was arrested again on the same charges (different victims).

In the second round of charges, he was convicted of kidnapping, torturing and abusing victims, some of them to the point of death.

What I am about to tell you comes from the statements made by his surviving victims (called the X Files), Marc Dutreox himself, and evidence from law enforcement. I've also added references/citations at the very end of this post.

Here we go.

Marc confessed to kidnapping, raping, drugging, torturing and filming children for many years. He also claimed he was doing it at the behest of a political elite who financed his career as a professional trafficker.

Not only did this political elite finance his efforts - they made specific requests of him. Sometimes they requested specific types of children (they were called ""party favors"" and he was asked to deliver kids of certain age, sex, race). Sometimes they requested specific means of torturing the children to fulfill their desires (orgies, satanic rituals involving sacrifices, torture games).

And sometimes they requested he film certain influential people engaged in these acts, for later use as blackmail.

He claimed many of his customers and financiers were world leaders. This was not a stretch of the imagination because he lived in Belgium, where the EU and NATO headquarters were located. This statement was also corroborated by victims who were able to identify specific politicians.

Anneke Lucas was one of his victims who testified against him. She claimed she was 6 years old when the cleaning lady hired by her mother sold her to the pedophile network in 1969. Her claims were extraordinary:

-She was raped over seventeen hundred hours before turning 12 years old.
-She was 6 years old when she was forced to participate in her first orgy, which included wearing an iron dog collar and eating human excrement.
-She would actually be delivered back to her parents from time to time. However, her parents themselves were complicit in the crimes and always sent her back to her abusers.
-Torture included being strapped to a butchers block used to execute other children. Other victims were forced to torture her for hours as part of their initiation.
-She was considered attractive and that made her preferred by her abusers. She claimed that she tried to use that to her survival advantage to the best of her ability, but by the age of eleven, she had become so broken that she was slated to be executed and disposed of.
-She said she was saved when one of her abusers negotiated for her freedom. That abuser would later sit as a defendant in the trial.

Other witnesses and victims would soon come forward, describing such things as “Black Masses,” with child and adult sacrifices taking place in front of observers and participants, which included prominent politicians and figures. This would be corroborated by a note found by police at the house belonging to Bernard Weinstein—a man who previously worked with Dutroux, but whom Dutroux had murdered. The letter contained very specific requests for certain types of victims for satanic sacrifices.

The letter was signed by a man who called himself 'Anubis'. It turned out 'Anubis' was the high priest of a satanic cult called 'Abrasax' whose real name was Francis Desmet. Police obtained a warrant and seized computers, documents, mail, actual human skulls, jars of blood, and all sorts of Satanic items - but none of this was enough to make an arrest.

As the Dutroux trial went public, other victims stepped forward and confirmed the testimony, offering up descriptions of sexual abuse and human sacrifice.

They also described “hunting parties” where elites would release naked children into the woods to hide, so that the elites themselves could hunt them down and slaughter them. Many of the stories from victims contained so many similarities, they were impossible to deny. For example, the hunting parties were often held at castles, where victims could not escape and were hidden from the public eye. Those not killed in the hunt were usually chased down and mauled/killed by Dobermans.

All of these victims echoed the testimonies of other, older survivors of ritual Satanic abuse from around the world.

It is also notable that Dutroux owned 10 homes valued at 6 million dollars.

It is also notable that Dutroux was not employed.

It is also notable that Dutroux received $1,200 per month in public assistance.

It is also notable that documents released by Wikileaks show large sums of money in various currencies were deposited into his wife's bank account.

It is also notable that those deposits coincided with reported kidnappings and missing children reports.

It is also notable that before his removal, judge Jean-Marc Connerotte was on the verge of publicly disclosing the names of high level government officials who had been recognized on video-tapes of sexual torture that took place in Dutroux's dungeon.

It is also notable that 20 potential witnesses for this case have died without explanation.

Does any of this sound familiar?
Are there any headlines today that sound like history is repeating itself?

Guys, not one single thing in this post is theory. It's all proven and on record.

You see the pictures attached to this post? Those are images of hunting games. They're paintings that people like Tony Podesta buy, and hang in his home, and invite others over to enjoy.

We all know Epstein was a sick sob who had friends in high places - the same friends that hang out with Tony Podesta.

You think Epstein was the only one? That he's somehow unique? Or was he the low level one they were willing to sacrifice to protect everyone else involved at a higher level?

Do you realize now that when it comes to trafficking, satanism, pedophilia, human sacrifices, organ harvesting, adrenachrome - that it is art imitating life? That these people who are so obsessed with the art that glorifes these things might actually, themselves, be engaged in these things?

Do you think normal, non-pedo, non-cannibal, average Joes would hang that garbage up in their homes?

Suddenly the claims that world leaders and governments being involved in this satanic horror show isn't so far fetched after all.

Suddenly its not so crazy to say that world agencies who claim to stop these crimes (WHO, UN) are actually facades that cover up the real work of procuring and enabling - yes, even participating - in these crimes.

Suddenly the whole house of cards comes crashing down.

With this one case, all the unbelievers are silenced.

For crying out loud, this trial was in 2004! Did you remember it? If not, do you wonder why it was not front page news across the world?

And if you're asking yourself HOW DO THESE PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH THIS - have you not yet figured out that the very people who are supposed to end it, are doing it?

Most everyone has watched an Epstein documentary on Netflix - I think there's been maybe 3 or 4 made since his death. And the one thing I heard people say over and over and over again was this: ""Where is Epstein's girlfriend and why hasn't she been arrested yet?""

Did anyone asking that question even try to find the answer? Or did you just shrug your shoulders and say, ""Well, it is what it is and there's nothing I can do about it"" and go on with your life?

Let me help you out.

Did you hear the news story from two weeks ago that President Trump fired federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman? He was the prosecutor in charge of the Epstein case.

AG Barr requested Berman step down, and Berman refused. So Trump fired him and Berman was replaced with prosecutor Audrey Strauss. And then suddenly BAM! Maxwell is in custody.

You now get a front row seat for the horror show that is about to come out.

You will not believe who is involved and how deep it goes. And you will not believe the lengths they'll go to in order to protect their secrets.

199,I Am a Democrat. My Eyes Are Now Open.,1437.0,s94ny9,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/s94ny9/i_am_a_democrat_my_eyes_are_now_open/,581.0,1642747855.0,"I want to start by saying that I am a college student in Los Angeles, registered Democrat; supported Bernie 2016, voted Biden 2020.

I have browsed this sub for a long time, but admittedly got caught up in the circus (mass psychosis) of the last couple years of political, social, civil, public health, and economic chaos. I have always had an intuitive feeling that Biden was ushered in as President by the powers that be, but went along with it because I felt that Trump was also chosen by the elite. Trump played a very important role, and now it was Biden’s turn (whether Trump was ready to go or not).

I thought, hell, might as well go along with it. Frankly, Biden’s promise of playing nice and ending COVID sounded comforting. What could he possibly do that would be so terrible? He would just remain a boring, white bread, moderately left President and not accomplish nor destroy anything significant.

Well, after yesterday’s press conference, my eyes have been completely opened. **Biden is here to oversee the fall of America as we know it.** He is here to oversee the great reset, the great awakening, whatever you want to call it. Dark times are ahead, and the powers that be have installed a puppet to mislead us, following the installation of a clown to distract us from 2016-2020.

I strongly believe that the next coming years will see great global economic, diplomatic, and societal fallout.

This includes: the worst economic crash of all time, stock market manipulation exposed, the inevitable rug pull of COVID, the public realizing that the last 2 years of their lives have been stolen from them for financial/political gain, Russia and China disturbing global sovereignty, Metaverses, cryptocurrency, and possibly much more. The economic crash will be so severe that it will be used to convince people that a great reset is NEEDED, just like 2 years of quarantines, masks, and vax were needed to stop the pandemic.

I also believe that we will continue to see the rapid cognitive decline of President Biden. I mean, I voted for the man, but yesterday’s press conference was *the single most embarrassing event I’ve ever witnessed* from the White House press floor. He was confused, delusional, misleading, out of touch, and by the end of it, there were numerous times where he was literally incoherent, unable to remember what he was saying as he was saying it.

This may or may not lead to the invocation of the 25th amendment. I’m not sure if TPTB will milk a full 4 years out of Biden or not, given Kamala’s inability to do apparently anything correct. The MSM is already turning on them both, so I’m not sure what this suggests for the impending chaos awaiting us in the next 3 years.

I have never experienced such a 180 degree revelation of my own cognitive dissonance and misinformed biases before. I feel shame, embarrassment, and anger for being conned into voting for these people. I truly believe that Biden & Harris are in place to oversee the darkest times in American history, and to divide this country further than it already is - in a completely different method than Trump’s rhetoric did.

My eyes are now open. I am now looking back at the 2020 election, the exploitation of the pandemic leading up to it, the media circus of narratives (COVID death tolls, Antifa, BLM, Proud Boys, George Floyd, Kyle Rittenhouse, presidential debates, election fraud, Jan 6th) and I see everything in a whole new perspective now. Even popular online conspiracy theory discourse all seem like orchestrated misinformation campaigns to me: Epstein, flight logs, Maxwell, Trump & Epstein, Biden sniffing kids, QAnon, Clintons, Plandemic, Bill Gates.

It's all fucking manipulated chaos and hysteria. We are living in an orchestrated sociopolitical theater, a clown circus, an amalgam of constant psyops and new world agendas. 

Why? I have absolutely no answer nor explanation. But I am seeing things that I have never seen before and I hoped to confide in this sub to share my truths.

Pieczenik claims that the Clintons are attempting a coup by using corruption and political cronyism to infiltrate and influence the White House, CIA, FBI and Attorney General.

He goes on to state that a counter-coup has been initiated by members of the ""intelligence community"" from over a dozen agencies with the help of Wikileaks. When Comey brought the Weiner emails to light, this was:

>the entrée in the counter-coup to say to the administration: ""we have your number."" Not only do we have your number, we're going to stop you from making Hillary the next POTUS, and at the same time we're going to convict and indict the POTUS, Loretta Lynch and many others who were involved in the massive coverup that occurred under the Clinton Foundation.

He goes on to state that this may be the first time both a coup and counter-coup was initiated via the internet. He stresses the need for a peaceful transition and that indeed this is a very important historical moment.

[A second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zVlaZyX3Q) was uploaded by Pieczenik on the same day, this time detailing the Clinton's ties to Jeff Epstein and the global pedophilia network. 

He continues by stating that there's much more to the Weiner emails story, and that the NYPD has information about Hillary Clinton and many of the elites and their predilection for pedophilia.

Been nice chatting with you folks. See some of you on the other side.

Go to r/all. Now sort r/all/new and let everyone know how long it takes to find posts from anything Reddit has found offensive. r/conspiracy or r/watchredditdie or anything controversial on the first page...s?

Edit: Because some people don't understand the difference...

There's admin shadowbans, subreddit shadow bans, and ghosting. Know the differences.
Admin shadow bans once widely used are now rare. You think you're online posting and commenting but no one but you can see it. Log out of account and look for your profile. If its gone, you are Admin shadow banned. r/amishadowbanned might help.
If you are subreddit specific shadow ban it involves a code in the automod placed in the wiki that does a user check and automatically mutes and hides all comments and postings. Nothing you can do about it.
If you are ghosted or are in a ghosted subreddit? As a ghost only other ghost can see you. Problem users are ghosted. Not just the right. The left too. This allows them to continue to interact without realizing their words and posts will never be visible to the average user of Reddit. Only to other ghosts. The problem subreddits are removed from normal search algorithms. Very rarely will one be allowed within Reddit's ranking system. Instead these subreddits must rely on redirects from other more populous subreddits. This is the only way they can increase traffic. By ghosting the subreddits the Admins allow them to function and can claim a hands off approach while starving the subreddits of potential users by hiding them from the front page and average user base.
Are you a ghost?

Many ghosts are reporting in about the dreaded grey arrow. Yes that means you're a ghost. As soon as Reddit's code is updated the arrows will ""look"" normal once again. But your actual interaction in Reddit posts popularity has been nullified. No more brigading for you. No more coordinated down vote campaigns against valued countries and companies. 

Horshack killed Epstein.

Having done a quick IP check I do not think ghosting currently goes beyond account level.

While this may sound plausible uninspected all one has to do is look at the comment count to actual comments you can see to tell there are ghost commenting. Is r/amIShadowbanned comprised? The numbers just do not equate.

r/drama users known for starting, well, drama have also noticed the effects. Ironic their subreddit is now being ghosted because it starts drama.

More broadly, what purpose does the monarchy serve? Why should the UK government continue to support the lavish lifestyle of this family?

Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, called Epstein's suicide an 'impossibility' that needed further congressional investigation.

'When an impossibility occurs involving powerful people and possible criminality there must be an investigation to end speculation,' Green wrote. 'Because the public has a right to know, I’m calling for a congressional investigation.'

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., voiced concern about Epstein's death.

'We need answers. Lots of them,' she wrote on Twitter. She then retweeted a post from former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, in which Mariotti says that the criminal probe into Epstein would conclude because 'no one else was charged in the indictment.'

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., called on the Bureau of Prisons to 'provide answers on what systemic failures of the MCC Manhattan or criminal acts allowed this coward to deny justice to his victims.'

Attorney General William Barr on Saturday decried the death of wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein in federal custody while he awaited charges on sex trafficking, saying the apparent suicide 'raises serious questions.'

'I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody. Mr. Epstein’s death raises serious questions that must be answered,' Barr said in a statement.

'In addition to the FBI’s investigation, I have consulted with the Inspector General who is opening an investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein’s death,' Barr added.

''So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,'' Trump said in an early morning string of tweets.

She has even received the Margret Sanger award, and been endorsed by Planned Parenthood. (Despite her since going on record as willing to compromise women's bodily autonomy)

But one thing I don't understand about this is how she is not being deeply hypocritical in her positions on how we ought to believe survivors of sexual assault.

Clinton has showed no sign of being supportive toward her husbands victims. Instead she has ignored them or worse. She has not gone on record with even a critical word of Bill Clinton, even as he paid off victims in an effort to squelch their charges against him. This is to say nothing of Bill's trips to Epstein's private island.

She has been only fully complicit.

Chelsea Clinton sits on the board of The Daily Beast, who has done their utmost to bury [a story which describes Hillary Clinton putting a rape victim ""through hell"" by buying exclusive rights to an interview on the subject and publishing it before the campaign season began](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/20/exclusive-hillary-clinton-took-me-through-hell-rape-victim-says.html).
